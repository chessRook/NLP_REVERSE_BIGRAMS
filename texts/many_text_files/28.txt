old  tent along this trip  he s a nice one  i should say       n n never you m m mind about steve  bandy legs  he t t told me he   knew  he c c could yank a m m mess of fine trout out of that c c creek   where it looked so s s shallow just back there  he s m m meaning to  w w wade in  too  i reckon  and when you s s smell the fish c c cooking  you ll be s s sorry you said what you did       well  let s get a move on  and start that shanty  i chose this place  partly on account of there being so much brush handy  you see       sure you did  max  it takes you to notice things that miss our eyes   here  let me handle the hatchet  because you see i was such a truthful  little shaver away back that my folks often regretted they hadn t named  me george washington       all i c c can say then  bandy legs  they b b builded wiser than they  knew when they j j just let it g g go at regrets  a f f fine george  washington you d m m make  i m thinking      the boy answering to the peculiar name of  bandy legs  laughed  good naturedly as he began to swing the sharp edged hatchet  and cut  down some of the required brush which  having camped many times before   he knew was suitable for their requirements     besides this sturdy young chap with the lower limbs that were a little  bowed  and which fact had doubtless suggested such a nickname to his  schoolmates  there were two others busily engaged in gathering the  material to be used in affording them a rude  but effective shelter  during the coming night     the one whom they called max seemed to be looked upon as a leader  for  it is absolutely necessary that in every pack of boys some one takes the  initiative  his whole name was max hastings  and on numberless occasions  he had shown an aptitude for  doing things  when the occasion arose   that gained him the respect of his chums  for a complete record of these  achievements the reader is referred to earlier volumes of this series   where between the covers will be found much interesting and instructive  reading     the third boy of the trio in sight was toby jucklin  while toby was  certainly agile enough when it came to acrobatic stunts  and such things  as boys are fond of indulging in  his vocal cords often loved to play  sad pranks with his manner of speech  as the reader has already  discovered  toby was fain to stutter in the most agonizing fashion  when  one of these fits came upon him he would get red in the face  and show  the greatest difficulty in framing certain words  then all of a sudden   as though taking a grip on himself  toby would stop short  draw in a  long breath  give a sharp whistle  and strange to say  start talking as  plainly as the next one     in time perhaps he would conquer this weakness  which after all is only  caused by nervousness  and a desire to rattle out words     there was a fourth chum also  the steve spoken of and who had slipped  away with his new steel jointed bait rod  and a handful of fat grubs  as  soon as he heard max say they had gone far enough on their way  steve   being one of those hasty lads who do a thing while many people would be  only figuring it out  had long ago fallen heir to a number of suggestive  nicknames  among others  touch and go steve   and  old lightning      these four lads were a long ways from their home town of carson  nestled  on the evergreen river  and near which we have seen them in the earlier  books of this series successfully carry out numerous of their  undertakings     in fact they were deep in the wildest part of the famous adirondacks at  the time we run across them on this particular occasion  there was not a  town within many miles  nor for that matter a regular camp where summer  guests were entertained  the difficulties to be encountered along this   carry  were so great that ordinary excursionists avoided it severely   indeed  few fishermen ever invaded these solitudes  although there were  undoubtedly many places where trout of generous size might be picked up     all this would make it seem a bit queer that max and his three chums  should venture into this section of the wilderness without a guide  along  so perhaps it might be wise to enter upon explanations while the  opportunity is open     now these tried and true chums had had strange things happen to them  before  but they were well agreed that their present undertaking far  exceeded everything else that had ever come their way  at least so far  as its being a romantic quest was concerned     everything combined to make it seem a page torn from one of those  old time fairy books they used to love to read when much younger  and  more gullible  in the first place  it was a wonderful piece of luck that  came their way  when the school directors agreed  after the summer was  half over  that the school buildings required considerable alterations  in order to make them sanitary for the coming winter  and really a  special providence that watches over the fortunes of boys and girls must  have caused the carpenters and masons to go on a protracted strike  so  that when this had been finally settled there was not nearly time enough  left in which to complete the extensive repairs     school had started  and gone along in a rough and ready fashion for some  weeks  but everybody was  sore  about it  the builders complained that  they could not accomplish half the work they should  because of the  annoyance of having so many children trotting around  and bothering  them  and the teachers were almost distracted on account of the constant  pounding together with the presence of rough men  who broke in upon  classes  and forced them to vacate certain rooms because they had to do  something there     and so along about the first of october the school board wisely  concluded that a vacation of some two weeks would do far less harm to  the scholars than a continuation of these interruptions  besides  the  teachers on their part threatened to also strike unless relief came  promptly     imagine the delight of such fellows as max  bandy legs  steve and toby  jucklin  all of whom loved life in the open so much  when they got the  chance to further indulge this propensity  especially at the most  glorious time of the whole year  when the nut crop was coming on  the  trees turning red and yellow from the magical touch of jack frost s cold  fingers  with a tang in the air that made a fellow twice as hungry as he  ever got in the hot old summer time     and then  as though fate had determined to make this the most wonderful  of periods in all their checkered careers  a thing happened that seemed  just like one of those old but once much beloved fairy stories     perhaps  by listening to the workers exchanging comments as they gather  the necessary brush  which later on would be fashioned into a shelter  capable of shedding even a moderate amount of rain  we may be able to  pick up enough general information to understand the nature of their  mission up into the adirondacks     bandy legs was speaking at the time  he had a little fault in the way of  often showing a disposition to look at the darker side of things  and  doubtless being unusually tired  after a hard day s tramp  with such a  heavy pack on his back  had something to do with his spirit of  complaining on the present occasion      well  all i can say  fellows   he remarked  as he carried an armful of  the stuff he had been gathering to the spot where max had already  commenced to erect the sides of the squatty shelter by driving stakes  into the ground   is that i hope we haven t come all the way up here on  a reg lar fool s errand  it d cost mrs  hopewell a pretty good sum  and  be a real disappointment to her  if after all we didn t find that  good for nothing nephew of hers  roland chase  honest to goodness now   i m a little inclined to believe he ll be leading us a wild goose chase   if you want my opinion       oh  l l let up  c c can t you  bandy legs   spluttered the indignant  toby  pausing for a minute to wipe the beads of perspiration from his  brow  and regain his breath in the bargain   you re g g getting to be a  regular old g g granny  that s what  with all your d d dismal  p p prophesies  tell me  d d did we  ever  f f fail yet in anything we  undertook  c c course we haven t  right in the start we found all those  b b bully p p pearls in those mussels we g g gathered in the big  sunflower river  and laid away a n n nice n n nest egg in bank for the  crowd  sure we ll f f find roland chase  we ve just g g got to  that s  all       all i want to say about it  boys   observed max   is that i admire the  grit of the boy  they told us he was something of a dude  didn t they   and that his rich uncle was afraid he d never amount to much anyhow  so  what did he do but make a most  extraordinary  will  at least  everybody  who s heard about that proviso says so  i heard judge perkins say though  he guessed the old man knew boys better than most folks  and had taken  a wise course to prove whether this roland had any snap in him or not       well  he was left just two thousand dollars cash down   said  bandy legs  in a thoughtful manner  as though reviewing the singular  circumstance   and if at the end of two years he could show that he had  doubled that amount  besides earning his own living  why he was to come  into two thirds of his uncle s fortune  some of our carson people who  know folks over in sagamore where the uncle lived tell whopping big  stories about the size of that fortune  i heard one man say he reckoned  it was as much as two hundred thousand dollars  in all       the funny part of it is   resumed max  shaking his head in a way rather  odd for him   that immediately after roland received his two thousand in  cash he disappeared from the scene  that was almost two years ago  and  from that day nobody in sagamore has ever had a peep at him  the fact is  he might almost be dead  once his other aunt  mrs  hopewell  who lives  now in carson  had a few lines from roland  he simply said he was alive  and well  and that he had hopes of seeing her again one of these fine  days       yes  that s r r right   burst out toby  in a disgusted tone   but not a  p peep did he give about what he was d d doing  or if he meant to show  up and c c claim his f f fine f f fortune  and all she could make out  was that the p p postmark on the l l letter was piedmont  n y   which  on looking up we f f found was away up here in the h h heart of the old  adirondacks       well   said max  still working industriously away   mrs  hopewell is  getting very much concerned about roland  somehow she seemed to fancy  the boy  though no one else thought he d ever amount to anything   because he used to like to wander around in the woods all the while  or  go fishing  instead of studying  but i guess those people hadn t ever  been boys themselves  and all of us can appreciate this liking for the  open that roland showed       and so   pursued bandy legs after the fashion of a story teller who  had reached a crisis in his tale   she asked max here if he wouldn t be  willing to undertake a trip to the mountains with several of his good  chums  meaning us  fellows  to try and locate the missing roland  and  bring back some encouraging news  for the good old soul is in great fear  that the second year will soon be finished  and unless roland is able to  show four thousand dollars in cash  most of the estate will go to his  older cousin  frederick  mrs  hopewell dislikes this chap very much   because she says he is a bad man  who drinks  and gambles  and does all  sorts of things old ladies detest  well  we took her up in a jiffy as  soon as we heard the glorious news about school being closed for two  weeks  and as she foots all the bills  we re bound to have a jolly time  of it  even if we don t run across roland  and i think that is like  looking for a needle in a haystack      that was a pretty long speech for even bandy legs to make  and yet it  covered considerable of the ground  and explained just how it came that  max and his three comrades chanced to be so far away from the home town     the boys were just about to turn their attention once more to the work  that had been undertaken when all of them suddenly stopped and listened      that was steve yelling then  i reckon   snapped the owner of the bowed  legs   but honest injun  i didn t make out what he said  mebbe now he  struck a whopper of a trout  and was giving one of his whoops  you all  know how excited steve does get if anything out of the way happens       l l listen   cried toby jncklin  jumping to his feet   d d didn t it  sound like he was yelpin  help       just what it seemed like to me   exclaimed max   something may have  happened to steve  because he s always getting himself in trouble  come  along  fellows  and we ll soon find out  there  he s whooping it up  again      and this time every one of the trio of running boys could plainly detect  something approaching agony in the thrilling cry of  help  oh  hurry up   fellows  help          chapter ii      gripped by a giant s unseen hands    that max  bandy legs and toby all kept their wits about them was  manifest  their actions had made this clear enough  for each of the trio  before starting  on the jump   as bandy legs described it  had made sure  to pick up something that  according to his mind  was apt to be needed   max  for instance  had snatched a rope that hung from a broken branch of  the tree  and which one of the boys had fetched along simply because  a  rope often comes in mighty handy for lots of things besides a hanging  bee   on his part toby had stooped down and possessed himself of the  camp hatchet  if it proved that steve was being attacked by a bobcat he  fancied he could make pretty good use of such a tool in an emergency   bandy legs  true to his hunter instinct  made out to secure the only gun  which had been brought with them on the trip     as they ran wildly in the direction from whence those appeals for  assistance still came  louder than ever  every fellow was straining his  vision to be the first to discover what it could be that was causing  steve to let out such alarming whoops     they did not have very far to go before suddenly all of them discovered  the object of their solicitude  he seemed to be standing nearly  waist deep in the stream  and still holding on to his tough little steel  rod      oh  shucks   gasped bandy legs  almost out of breath from his violent  exertions   he s only struck a mud turtle  or something like that  and  wants us to come and see  it s a burning shame to give us all such a  scare over a measly turtle       b b bet you it s a w w woppin  b b big fish   ejaculated toby      keep on running   snapped max   he needs help  and in a hurry  too      this sort of talk amazed both the others  so far as they could see steve  stood there quite alone  they looked again but could see no savage  animal attacking their comrade  nor was there any vast disturbance in  the water  as though some marine monster might be trying to drag him  down  besides  such things as alligators or sharks were utterly unknown  up here in the adirondacks      but  max  he s all right  as far as i can see   expostulated  bandy legs  in reality unwilling to keep up that violent exertion just  to please some silly whim on the part of the fisherman  who  like as  not  would give them the laugh after they came up puffing and blowing  like porpoises      look again   snapped max   don t you see how deep he s in  pretty  nearly up to his waist  isn t he       that s all right   said bandy legs   but if the silly has gone and  waded deeper than he meant to  why don t he just turn around and walk  out again       because he can t   max told him  still running      hey  w w what s hindering him   stammered toby  thrilled by this new  mystery that had so suddenly dawned upon them      the sand s got too tight a grip on him   cried max   and he s sinking  deeper all the time       oh  thunder  it s quicksand  then   exploded bandy legs     having now the key to the enigma explaining steve s strange action  as  well as his queer antics while floundering about out there in the little  stream  both boys could easily see that may evidently spoke the truth   so those envious spanish courtiers found it easy to balance an egg on  end  after columbus showed them how to do the trick     in another half minute they arrived on the shore of the little stream   steve out there  with the shallow water coming now up almost to his  waist  greeted their arrival with a sickly grin      sorry to bother you  boys   he said   but seems like i ve gone and got  into a nasty pickle  please yank me out of this  won t you      impetuous bandy legs was about to instantly start forward when max  gripped him by the arm      don t be foolish  bandy legs   he told the other  severely   you d only  get yourself in the same boat  if you stood there and tried to drag  steve out  and two would be harder to take care of than one       but say  don t be  too  slow about starting something  will you    urged steve  once again looking nervous   why  i m sinking right along   i tell you  every time i try to get one foot up t  other goes down three  inches further  because i have to bear all my weight on it  this is no  laughing matter  boys  i ll be swallowed up before your eyes soon if you  don t get busy  max  you ought to know how to extricate a fellow from  the quicksand       there are lots of ways in which it can be done   the other told him   meanwhile measuring distances with his eye  as though he already had a  plan in mind   if when you first discovered that you were sinking you  had thrown yourself sideways  and started to crawl or roll  regardless  of how wet you got  you might have made it  for in that way you d have  presented more of your body to the action of the sand  then a mattress  could be made from branches  weeds or any old thing  that would bear the  weight of one or two of us  but i ve got even a better scheme than that  to work       please hurry   pleaded the imprisoned boy      keep cool  steve   advised max   because there s positively no danger   now that we re on deck       but tell me what you mean to do  max   continued steve      make use of this rope  which you see i just happened to fetch along    explained the other  holding up the article in question   it s going to  save time  too  because one of us would have had to run back to camp   and that must mean delay  you re deep enough in as it is  i guess       a whole lot deeper than is pleasant  i tell you   steve instantly  added   why  at the rate it s sucking me down i guess in less n a  quarter of an hour the water would be up to my chin  and then  oh   fellows  just imagine how i d feel when it began to cover my mouth   you re not going away  i hope  max      this last almost frantic cry was caused by a movement on the part of the  one on whom poor steve s hopes most depended      i m going to shin up this big tree that sends a limb out right over  your head  don t you see  steve   max told him  reassuringly   once i  get above you and we ll make good use of this rope of mine  the limb  will act as a lever  and when the boys get to pulling at the other end  of the rope you ve just  got  to come out  that s all there is about  it       hurrah  that s the ticket   shouted bandy legs  seeing the game now for  the first time   steve  you re as good as landed  bless that old rope   it s already proved worth its weight in gold   steve watched operations  anxiously  despite the positive assurance conveyed in these words from  his chums  the terrible grip of that clinging sand made him cold with  apprehension  he imagined all sorts of things  from the rope breaking  under the sudden and terrible strain  to his arms being drawn from their  sockets in the battle between the tenacious sand and the muscular  ability of the two boys ashore     when max managed to reach a point directly above the one in peril   straddling the friendly limb as only a nimble boy could do  he quickly  fashioned a slip noose at one end of the rope  this he lowered until  steve could snatch it  which he did with all the eagerness shown by the  drowning man who clutches at a straw      fix the noose under your arms  steve   directed the master of  ceremonies  calmly enough  though possibly max was more excited than he  chose to let the other see   and get the knot around so it will be  exactly in front  then  when i give the word for the boys to commence  heaving  you work both legs as hard as ever you can  it s going to help   more or less  you know  i can t do much up here  in the way of pulling   for i d lose my balance  but make up your mind we re meaning to yank you  out of that in a jiffy  steve       oh  i hope so  max  i surely hope so      everything was soon ready  steve had complied with the directions  and  now awaited the issue with all the fortitude he could command   afterwards perhaps steve might sometime or other even laugh  as he  remembered how scared he was  but just then  with the difficulty still  unadjusted  it was not at all humorous      ready  everybody   called out max     receiving an affirmative reply from three pairs of lips  he went on to  say      then get busy  pulling  make it a steady haul  and no jerks  or you ll  hurt steve more than is necessary  steady there  bandy legs  no hurry   remember  just a regular increasing pull  good enough  boys      steve had obeyed instructions  and by the way he worked both feet as  soon as he felt the strain one might think he was practicing swimming  lessons  it must have given him more or less physical pain to feel the  terrible drag of the rope under his arms  but he shut his teeth hard  together  and kept back a groan      now rest a bit  toby and bandy legs   called out max   how about it   steve  you moved some  didn t you       yes yes  quite a little  max   cried the other   please get busy again  right away  i m sick of staying in this old quicksand      he still clung tenaciously to his steel fishing rod  as though he meant  that it should share his fate  once more the team ashore started in  now  their task seemed lighter  as though  having succeeded in dragging their  chum up several inches  with his whole weight now suspended by the rope   the job was going to be finished in short order     soon steve  crowing joyously  was drawn completely out of the water  he  gave this a last suggestive kick and then dangled there in midair   spinning around like a teetotum      hand me your rod  steve   commanded max   then use your arms and pull  yourself up on the limb  after that you can easily hunch along like i  do  and get to the main trunk  it s all over but the shouting  steve   and you can consider yourself pretty lucky to get off as easily as you  do  with a pair of wet trousers       i m thankful enough  max  you can make sure of that   said the other   carrying out the suggestion  and thus freeing both hands for the task of  mounting to the friendly limb     before long he had reached the ground  where his three chums each  gravely shook hands with him  steve was already getting back his nerve   that had been under a severe strain      but anyway i did have bully good luck pulling out fat trout  boys   he  told them   you can pick up a dozen along this side of the stream  fact  is  it was such splendid fun that i just stood too long in one place   catching them and tossing the beauties ashore  and so when i tried to  move  why  i couldn t to save my life  it felt like a giant had gripped  both feet  and was holding me down  the more i tried the worse it got   whee  i would have been pretty badly scared if no one was near by  i own  up to that      perhaps the others mentally considered that as it was  steve had looked  a  good deal concerned  at the time of their arrival  but not wishing to  harrow his feelings any further just then they kept this to themselves   though bandy legs did give toby a suggestive wink  to which the other  replied in like kind     it was found upon gathering the trophies of steve s skill as an angler  that they had quite enough for a meal  consequently steve announced that  he guessed he needn t start in again with rod and hook and grub     all of them were soon busily engaged in fixing up the camp  since they  had thought it best not to try and fetch a heavy tent along with them  they knew it would be necessary to construct some such brush shanty  shelter every night unless they could find a convenient ledge under  which a camp could be made  but all of these boys had often slept under  the stars  with the heavens for a canopy overhead  so that they did not  feel at all worried over the circumstance     as the sun sank lower and lower toward the horizon the camp began to  assume a comfortable air  the brush shelter had been finished  and  pronounced equal to any they had ever built before  it might not prove  wholly rain proof  but as for keeping off the dew  and protecting them  against the chilly night air  it offered them  all the comforts of  home   as steve put it     then supper was started  a fire having been built after the most  approved method in vogue among guides and hunters of long experience   indeed  max and his companions were far from being green to the ways of  the woods  they had learned heaps through their many camping  experiences  and some time before a visit to an old trapper had  initiated them into dozens of secrets of the craft that would never be  forgotten        again the talk was of the strange mission that had brought them up to  the adirondacks  bandy legs could not seem to get over his belief that  they were bound to have all their trouble for their pains      what sort of a clue have we got to work on for a starter  fellows  tell  me   he went on to say  just as they were starting in to enjoy the  supper that had been supervised by a trio of eager cooks  all as hungry  as boys could well be  and continue to exist   all we know is that when  this boy  roland chase  left sagamere  almost two years back  he was a  sickly  white faced chap  and with only one decent trait about him   which was his love for outdoors  though up to then it had been mostly a   yearning   because they wouldn t let him get away from the house much  on account of his delicate constitution  well  we re looking for some  such chap  but up to now we haven t got on his track           with trapper jim in the north woods       but hold on  bandy legs   expostulated steve   you forget that we did  hear about a boy that answered that description  though nobody seemed to  know his name  he was sometimes seen in the company of a half drunken  old guide named shanks somewhere around mount tom district  and now  we ve come up this way in the hope of crossing his trail  not that i ve  got much expectation myself that we ll be sure to find this same   roland  who turns out to be a sort of will o  the wisp to us  but since  his old aunt was so kind as to finance this expedition  why we re bound  to do all we can to make it a blooming success  that s what       well   commented max  who seemed to be the most confident one of the  quartette   remember  if we fail to make connections it ll be the first  time on record that we ve really been stumped  i don t believe in  hard luck stories  as a rule success comes only to those who deserve it   and we ve still got most of that two weeks  vacation ahead of us  to  hunt around for roland chase      somehow max always seemed to say things calculated to make his chums  feel more satisfied  it is a mighty good thing to have a real optimist  in camp  especially when the weather gets bad  and everything else seems  to go wrong  even bandy legs took on a more cheerful air  and brightened  up after hearing max say this  they had more or less reason to feel  proud of the record they had made in the past  so far as accomplishing  things went  and the people around carson would be apt to tell any one  inquiring about max and his cronies that they had actually done several  exceedingly smart things  and were boys far above the average     the supper was voted a huge success  and never had fish been fried a  more delicious brown than those in the pan  perhaps steve entertained a  private opinion of his own  to the effect that never had a higher price  been paid for a mess of fish than he offered up when he found himself  made a prisoner of the unseen giant residing under the quicksands  but  all the same  steve devoured his share of the fish as smartly as the  next one  he doubtless felt that he deserved having a feast  after his  adventure in supplying the materials     they were almost through eating  and feeling particularly well  satisfied  as is usually the case  when the appetite has been taken care  of  when toby jucklin was seen to be staring straight ahead      what ails you  toby   demanded steve  discovering the mysterious  actions of the other   think you see a ghost  or was it a  coon whisked  past  smelling our fine spread here  speak up  can t you  and tell us      toby managed to find his tongue  and as usual when excited made quite a  mess of his explanation      w w why  y y you s s see  i  t that is  there s s s somebody  oh  look  for yourselves and you ll understand quicker n i c n tell you      sometimes toby seemed to become so provoked with his ungovernable vocal  organs that he would get angry  and wind up by speaking as plainly as  the next one     but before then max  and perhaps the other pair in the bargain  had  discovered a figure advancing slowly toward them  eagerly bandy legs  stared  perhaps he began to already entertain a wild hope that the  newcomer would prove to be the very boy whom they had come so far to  find  but if this were so he must have almost immediately discovered his  mistake  for the other was a sun burned and wind tanned lad  sturdily  built  and apparently the son of some woods guide  for he carried a gun   and was dressed in rough though serviceable khaki trousers and blue  flannel shirt         chapter iii      obed grimes bobs up     howdy  strangers   said the other  as he slowly approached the spot  where max and his three chums still sat around the fire  feasting on  their spread   i happened to see yer blaze  and guessed i d drop in to  see who yah might be   taint often anybody comes up this way  though to  be sure thar was two gentlemen fishin  hereabouts last summer      somehow max liked his manner of speech  he also thought he could detect  something like a love for humor in those sparkling eyes      sit down  and have a bite with us  won t you   he remarked  making a  suggestive movement with his hand  as though calling attention to the  fact that there was still plenty of room on the log which he and toby  jucklin had occupied in common   sorry the trout s given out  but we ve  got plenty of other grub  and be sure you re welcome      the sturdy woods boy was looking them over  bandy legs  suspicious as  usual  rather took umbrage at this action  he eyed the newcomer as  though not yet quite willing to echo the warm invitation accorded him by  max  but steve was already getting an extra tin cup for coffee  and  fortunately there still remained an abundant supply of the amber fluid  in the capacious pot     apparently the newcomer had determined that it would be prudent for him  to comply with the invitation thus cordially given  so he sat down and  made himself at home  up there in the woods there exists a genuine  hospitality that never hesitates to extend the right hand of fellowship  to any straggler who chances to enter the camp  there seems to be  something in the healthy ozone of the wilderness that makes all men  comrades for the time being  the latchstring is always out in camp  and  never does an appeal for help go disregarded     max proceeded to immediately introduce himself and his three chums by  name  he of course mentioned the fact that they came from a town named  carson  situated far away from that region  but then of course the woods  boy could never have heard of such a place before  still  his eyebrows  arched  and he seemed to once again observe his entertainers with fresh  interest  but then when max hastings chose to exert himself to make a  favorable impression every one fell under his spell     and when bandy legs  toby and steve noticed that max did not think fit  to say a single word about the queer mission which had brought them to  the mountains they too concluded that it would be just as well not to be  too hasty about telling all their business to a stranger  a little later  on  perhaps  when they came to become better acquainted with the other   they might ply him with questions in order to find out if he chanced to  know such a weakly looking fellow as roland chase     of course after that it was up to the other to tell them whom he was  he  did not have any hesitation  from which steve concluded there could be  no reason for keeping his identity a secret      course i got a name  too  even if it ain t  quite  so scrumptuous as  yours  but obed grimes suits me just as well  and it ain t never kept me  from eatin  three square meals a day  when i could get  em   he told  them  soberly  though that odd little gleam in his eyes mystified max  somewhat      i suppose you live around this section  then  obed   he remarked  as he  cleaned out the frying pan that had contained the ham and eggs  the  latter having been carried all the way from the last small village they  passed through  and which supply would doubtless be the last they might  enjoy for a long time to come      oh  yes  thar s a plenty of grimeses up this way   the other replied   promptly   fact is  the grimeses are a big family  all told  thar s  grandad grimes to start with  and he s going on ninety now  then there s  uncle hiram  uncle silas  uncle job  uncle sephus  uncle  nicodemus    and a whole lot more  besides aunt rebecca  aunt sophia  aunt hetebel   and  glory to goodness  i could sit here for ten minutes and string out  the names of the grimeses there are in the mountains  but say i m   awful  hungry  and you ll excuse me if i get busy with this fine grub   the other names will keep till next time  i reckon       whew  it must feel funny to belong to such a big family   remarked  steve  who did not happen to have any close relatives himself      oh  shucks  none of  em ever bother about  me  any   said the boy  as  well as he could with his mouth stuffed of the ham and bread  which he  presently washed down with a copious draught of hot coffee   they just  know that obed he c n take good care o  hisself      bandy legs began to show a rising interest in the other  his suspicions  were beginning to give way under the genial ways of the said obed  that  smile on the dusky face of the visitor in the camp had commenced to get  its work in  by degrees perhaps bandy legs might even come to like obed  grimes  though  truth to tell  he had always despised that last name   for a boy answering to it had once treated bandy legs in a most  humiliating fashion  and this still rankled in his memory  although  years had fled since the occurrence      do you mean from that  obed   he went on to remark  that you re all  alone up here in the woods near old mount tom  haven t you any of the  other grimeses along with you      the boy shook his head in the negative  and grinned again  max was  trying to study him  and he found the task one well worthy of his best  efforts  in the beginning he determined that obed was no ordinary chap   but possessed of sterling characteristics  he waited for the  conversation to get further along  confident that the other had a  surprise up his sleeve which he might condescend to share with them   after he had become fully satisfied they were to be trusted  and that he  could look upon them in the light of friends      nary a grimes  cept me inside o  twenty miles o  here  and that s a  fact   he assured bandy legs  after finishing his drinking   fact is   most o  the family don t know jest where i m at  and say  between us  i  ain t a carin  about tellin   em      that looked a bit singular  bandy legs thought  his suspicions returned  again  though with diminished force  for somehow he could not look into  that frank and even merry face of the woods boy and actually believe he  was  off color  in any way      but what do you do with yourself all alone  i d like to know   burst  out impetuous steve   are you making a living playing at guide for  parties of tourists  or fishermen and hunters  and  say  you don t mean  to tell me you stay all alone up in this wilderness right through the  winter      obed grimes nodded his head cheerfully      i ain t got any choice in the matter  yuh see   he told them   mysteriously   just  got  to stay  why  it would bust the hull business  to smash if i  lowed myself to skip out  even for a week or two  i m  tied down to it  that s right      bandy legs exchanged a significant look toby jucklin  he scratched his  head with the air of one who found himself up against a hard  knotty  problem  apparently  if the stranger in camp was trying to mystify them   he had already succeeded in tangling up the wits of bandy legs completely     max continued to sit there and take it all in  there was no need of his  saying anything so long as the other fellows had embarked on the task of  drawing obed out and learning just what he was doing to keep him  marooned up there summer and winter  like a regular old recluse  or  woodchuck      but there must be heaps and heaps of snow here winters   suggested  steve   and i d think you d find it pretty hard getting about       oh  not so bad when you have snow shoes  obed told him  with a shrug of  his shoulders  and another attack on the contents of his tin panninkin       course not   steve hastened to say  as though he had guessed that this  would be the answer   but when the law is on the deer and partridges it  must be hard to keep to a regular diet of trout  i c n stand them for a  while  but in the end i d get sick of the smell of  em cooking       oh  i have plenty of good grub along   chuckled obed   i was on my way  home at the time i glimpsed your fire  and bein  full o  wonder  concernin  who could be around these diggings right now i crept up to  spy on ye  but say  soon s i glimpsed your crowd  and saw that you was  only a bunch o  boys  why i felt easier   cause i knew then you couldn t  mean to bother me any      now that sounded queer again  bandy legs thought  why should any one  take the trouble to  bother  obed grimes  unless  indeed  he had been  doing something that he hadn t ought to  and hence expected to be  visited sooner or later by emissaries of the law  possibly in the shape  of angry game wardens     all sorts of strange thoughts flashed through that active brain of the  boy with the bowed legs  he wondered whether obed could be a desperate  young criminal  had his family  those excellent grimes of whom he had  spoken in such proud accents  cast him out as altogether beyond hope   bandy legs could hardly think this when he looked again into that face   and caught the gleam of those merry orbs  no  obed might be a  peculiar   sort of fellow  but really there did not seem to be much of guile in his  make up  if it turned out to be so  then he  bandy legs  was ready to  call himself a mighty poor reader of character     so he  too  relapsed into temporary silence and let steve carry on the  interrogations  which the said steve considered himself very well  qualified to do since he aspired in his secret soul to some fine day  study to be a lawyer      but why should anybody want to bother you  obed   he asked   to hear  you talk in that way a fellow would think you had a lot of enemies  hanging around  trying the best they knew how to give you trouble       well  i ain t had any mix up ever since i ve been here   admitted the  other  with a slight frown crossing his face   but lately i got wind o   some news that s worried me a heap  fact is  i m afraid i m goin  to be  right smart bothered with a bunch o  thieves who d like to  steal  my  outfit from me      steve fairly gasped  he could not make head or tail of what the other  was so deliberately telling him  max  listening  and watching that  expressive face of obed  secretly believed the newcomer was purposely  drawing steve on  meaning to surprise him when finally he chose to  explain it all  so max did not attempt to interfere  but let things go  on as they were doing  satisfied that the answer to the conundrum would  soon come      steal your outfit from you   echoed steve  when he could catch his  breath   do you mean that you re carrying on some sort of business   then  up here in the woods       reckon that s about right  steve   obed replied  and his familiar use  of the other s name could be easily explained by that spirit of  free  masonry  that exists among all boys   i ve got a business  which looks  like it was goin  to pan out right decent  and make me some money in the  bargain  that s why they re meanin  to rob me  i guess  anyhow  it  hinges on that same thing  and i thought you might be that crowd first   but i soon saw i was mistaken  and that you d be my friend       but what sort of business is it you re in  obed   asked steve  boldly      me  oh  i m only a farmer   confessed the other  chuckling as he spoke      a farmer   echoed steve  looking blank   but how could anybody steal  your ground away  or carry off your crops  i d like to know       why  yuh don t jest understand  steve  i ain t no regular hayseed  i m  a fur farmer  you see  and you could carry my crop of fox pelts away  easy enough on your own back          chapter iv      bandy legs suspects    max hastings smiled  he at the same time drew a breath of relief   satisfied to know that his first impression of the sturdy looking young  chap was confirmed  and convinced that the said obed grimes must be the  right sort of fellow     steve and bandy legs fairly gasped  as though they had received a real  shock  at the same time the eyes of the former glistened with  newly awakened interest      a fur farmer  do you say  obed  and raising foxes for the market  are  you   he burst out with  delightedly   now  i ve read a heap about that  sort of thing in the papers and magazines  but i never thought i d  actually run across anybody that had the nerve and confidence to go into  it as a business  and you say you re making good  are you  obed  that s  fine       i ve turned my  tention to raisin  real black foxes  first thing    explained the other  with a touch of genuine pride in his manner  max  could easily see   and if the try turns out as profitable as i reckon  she promises to be  why  then  i m figgerin  on tryin  to raise mink and  marten and sech other furs as fetch top notch prices       then i guess you must have trapped all sorts of wild animals before  now  obed   suggested steve  eagerly   so you know their habits to a  fraction  because  of course  only one who is posted in that direction  could ever hope to make a success of a fur farm      obed grinned and nodded his head      oh  i reckon i m up a little bit in all sech things   he said airily  enough   and after all  it ain t so  very  hard to raise foxes  i was  afraid fust off it might be what they told me  that blacks ain t to be  relied on to breed true to strain  but shucks  i ve got some cubs that  are dandies  wait till you see  em  boys      that sounded as though  sooner or later  obed meant to have them visit  his fur farm  and see with their own eyes what he had been doing   bandy legs  skeptical once more  told himself he only hoped the whole  thing might not turn out to be a myth  and that the said obed himself  prove to be a deception and a fraud      i understand that the pelts of black foxes are worth a whole lot of  money   remarked steve   fact is  we know that to be so  because we once  had such a skin given to us by a man who made a business of trapping       it all depends on the quality of the pelt   explained obed   some ain t  worth as much as three hundred dollars  because they ve got defects  yuh  see  then again a real fine skin has fetched as much as thirty six  hundred dollars in london markets      evidently  obed was well posted  at any rate  whether he really had  such a fur farm of his own or not  bandy legs concluded  and then he  again allowed himself to give imagination free rein  and for a time  even looked on obed as the essence of truth  doubly distilled     sitting there by the fire  which one of he boys replenished every little  while  obed told them many very interesting things connected with that  strange farm of his  all this in his odd vernacular which max tried to  get the hang of  in order to judge whether it signified that the country  boy lacked an education or not  he continued to be more or less  mystified  however  though concluding that obed was just one of those  customary country boys often run across on farms who take especial  delight in joking and playing little tricks which they consider  humorous      but he isn t at all bad  i ll stake everything on that  max also told  himself  as he sat and listened to the really interesting descriptions  given by the other of his successes  and first failures along the  difficult line of breeding foxes in captivity  with scores of things  against him  which had to be overcome     an hour passed by in this manner  when max saw their visitor showing  signs as if he meant to leave them  he took a hand in the conversation   which up to then had been almost wholly monopolized by bandy legs  steve  and the woods boy      it s very kind of you to invite us over to inspect this wonderful  little fur farm of yours  obed   he went on to say   but you ll have to  give us directions how we can get there  unless you mean to accept our  offer of a blanket by the fire here tonight  when we could go along with  you in the morning      obed looked sober      i d like to stay longer with you  boys   he hastened to say  as though  he really meant it   but i ought tuh be gettin  back home  thar s some  duties waitin  for me to look after  and then i ain t quite easy in my  mind  bout them two fellers that s up here in the woods  they ain t  meanin  to do any shootin   even if they have got lem scott along as a  guide  and he the meanest skunk in the hull county  lots o  folks do  say  and a poacher in the bargain that the wardens are layin  to grab  one o  these fine days  now i ll jest up and tell yuh how to get to my  place  it s as easy as water runnin  down hill      he entered into explicit directions  and max pinned them in his memory   in fact  obed simply told them to follow the stream up three miles until  they came to a bunch of seven birch trees on the right hand bank  there  they were to pick up a trail they would find  follow it half a mile  and  at that they would see a cabin under the hemlocks and pines  which would  be his humble home woods      we ve got it all down pat  obed   said steve   and like as not you ll  see the bunch of us trailing along there some time tomorrow morning   i ve always been crazy to see a fur farm  after reading so much about  them  and you bet i don t mean to let this chance slip by me      max now thought it time to make a few inquiries himself  he wanted to  ask obed whether he had ever run across a boy by the name of roland  chase  a sickly looking chap in the bargain  it might possible to pick  up a clue in this way  and they had reached a point where they could not  afford to let any opportunity for acquiring information get past them     in order to pursue this course  however  max realized that it would be  necessary to enter into some sort of explanation concerning the nature  of the peculiar errand that had tempted them to come to the adirondacks      i want to ask you a question or two  obed   he began   but first of all  i ought to tell you what brings us here      accordingly  max proceeded to explain how the school had be closed for  two or more weeks in early october  and what a singular thing came about  to tempt them into taking an outing  he was watching the woods boy at  the time he first mentioned mrs  hopewell  and spoke the name of roland  chase  but if the other gave any unusual signs of interest  max failed  to catch the same  still  obed was listening with all his might  and it  seemed as though the unusual story of the inheritance that was to be  given to the said roland in case he made good  interested him     max in this manner explained just why he and his three chums had  accepted the generous offer of the elderly lady  so deeply concerned  over the welfare of her nephew boland  that she was ready to spend  almost any reasonable sum in order to at least learn that the poor boy  was alive  and in fairly decent health     they had been told to assure him  in case they ever managed to locate  the elusive roland  that he should not worry because of not being able  to comply with the absurd conditions of uncle jerry s ridiculous will   because she had enough of this world s goods for both  and she meant to  leave it all to him  roland  so she begged him to come back to her  and  live his own life again  even though he had spent the last penny of his  two thousand dollar legacy  and was as poor as job s turkey     all this made an interesting story  and must have amused the woods boy  more or less  because max knew how to put considerable pathos in it   obed sat there shading his eyes with his hand to keep the glow of the  fire from dazzling him  occasionally he would interrupt to ask some  natural question  which made max think he was taking a fair amount of  interest in the account      what i wanted to ask you   concluded max   was whether you d ever  happened to run across this same roland chase in the mountains  we heard  about a fellow answering his description who was seen in company with a  dissipated guide named shanks  i thought perhaps you might help us out   obed      obed looked him straight in the face      so far as i knows on  max   he went on to say  seriously   i ain t  never met any feller like yuh say face to face  about that man shanks  i  know he s said to be a tough un  i saw him some months back down at  sawyer s forks  and by hokey  now that you mention it  thar  was  a  sickly lookin  young feller along with him then  but say  his name was  bob jenks  or somethin  like that  and not roland chase       oh  well  so far as that goes   said max   he may have changed his  name  some people think nothing of sailing under false colors  and if it  turns out that roland has taken up with such a disreputable character as  this drunken guide seems to be  i don t wonder at him wanting to hide  his identity  so you think you must be going home  do you  obed       yep   the other observed  gaining his feet   and i wanter to thank all  o  ye for givin  me sech a pleasant evenin   i ain t had sech a good  time this long while back  but then the grimeses all are  customed to  roughin  it  granddad used to be away all by hisself for as much as two  years  trappin  up in canada  it s in the blood  i reckon  now  yuh mean  to drop in  and visit me  don t ye  i ll be expectin  yuh  and have  something to eat awarmin   though course i ain t a good cook like you  fellers  as has had so much experience  so long  boys      he waved them a cheerful goodbye  once more smiled at each in turn   whirled on his heel  and was gone  seeming to vanish in the shadows of  the nearby woods like  a wisp of smoke when the wind strikes it   as  steve remarked     after the departure of their guest  it was only natural that he should  be the subject of conversation about the fire as the four chums lay  there taking things easy      max  honest to goodness now   bandy legs remarked   do you really take  any stock in that fairy story he told us about an imaginary fur farm  it  struck me obed is givin to yarnin  just for the love of it  all that  stuff about his relatives may have been true  and again only nonsense   it s my opinion there isn t any granddad grimes  or uncle hiram   nicodemus and so forth  he grinned like everything when he was reeling  those names off so slick  yes  he was stringing us  i bet you       w w why   burst out toby just then   who wouldn t have to s s snicker  when he had a w w whole lot of relations with such f f funny names  it d  make me grin from ear to ear every time i h h happened to think of  em   you re the greatest hand to s s suspect anybody i ever s s saw   bandy legs  now  i want you to k k know that i think obed the  s s straight g g goods  and i m taking a heap of s s stock in seeing  that bully f f fur f f farm of his tomorrow  ain t you  max       certainly i am   replied the other  without a second s hesitation   in  the first place  bandy legs  you must understand that nobody could talk  so interestingly on a subject unless he knew a lot about it  he told us  a dozen things about fur farming that i never heard before       huh  and perhaps nobody else ever heard of them either  max   grunted  the far from satisfied bandy legs      nothing will ever satisfy him except he sees those kit foxes with his  own eyes   asserted steve  almost indignantly   handles them with his  own paws  and asks every little critter whether he really belongs to  obed grimes  bandy legs is the worst doubting thomas going  when the fit  comes on him      even this sort of talk did not convince the objector      say what you will  fellows   bandy legs went on  stubbornly   there s a  wheen of queer things connected with this same obed grimes  and i won t  take that back till he shows us his wonderful old farm  where he raises  black foxes for the fur market  stop and think how mysteriously he  popped in on us  will you  why  he as much as owned up that he had been  spying on us for a long time  if toby here hadn t discovered him  peeking  and pointed that way  chances are he wouldn t have shown up at  all  now  what made him snoop around our camp like that       say  didn t he explain all that just as straight as a die   objected  steve  who seemed to have conceived quite a fancy for obed grimes  the  woods boy   he told us he had reason to fear some unscrupulous fellows  were hanging around this region and meaning to steal his pets when they  got half a chance  that was why he wanted to watch  and make sure we  didn t belong to the same crowd       oh  yes  a likely story  too   continued bandy legs  with a sneer   why  should anybody want to rob a poor boy who was trying to earn his living  by farming  even if it was furs he raised instead of grain or hogs or  stock       why  you poor ninny  the reason is as plain as the nose on your face   bandy legs  and that s not invisible by a big sight  when a black fox  pelt will fetch a thousand dollars  more or less  and can t well be  traced once it gets mixed with other pelts  it stands to reason that any  thief would want to steal it  as to your doubting that there are any  other people up in this section  you seem to forget  bandy legs  that  around noon today we sighted a plain smoke some miles away  which we  opined must have been made by some advance hunters  waiting for the law  to be off deer  well  why couldn t it have been the people obed says he  fears  who made that smoke  now  for my part  i believe every word obed  grimes said  he s the straight goods every time  and you can see it in  his eye  for he looks you direct in the face      thereupon  bandy legs  as though realizing that he had raised a hornet s  nest about his ears  deemed it the part of discretion to shrug his  shoulders after the manner of one who   convinced against his will is of  the same opinion still       we ll let the subject drop  steve   he said  hastily   it ain t worth  quarreling over  the proof of the pudding is in the eating of it  and  tomorrow we ll  know  what s what  but remember  if it turns out that  we ve been bamboozled  don t blame me  because i ve warned you all       if we had a chill from every warning you ve sprung on us  bandy legs    steve told him  witheringly   why  say  we d have gone all to pieces  long before now  you re a regular old bad weather prognosticator  that s  what you are       that s right  get to calling names  it s a habit with people who know  they are in the wrong   grumbled bandy legs  but  nevertheless  he  drew  within his shell   and said nothing further about obed grimes or his  suspicions concerning the same         chapter v      packing over the  carry     later on the conversation began to lag  steve was noticed drowsily  nodding his head in a suggestive way  and then after a sudden start he  would look around aggressively  as if to remark   who said i was  sleepy   but within three minutes he would be at it again     in fact all of the boys were really tired out  the day s tramp had been  a difficult one  even for fellows accustomed to such things  and those  regular adirondack packs  with a band crossing the forehead in the usual  way  had seemed doubly heavy before they decided to stop for the night     of course there were sounds to be heard all around them  but   familiarity breeds contempt   and from max down they were all  accustomed to hearing similar noises whenever they spent nights in the  open  the owl would whinny or hoot according to his species  the loon  send forth his agonizing and weird shriek from some distant lake  a fox  might bark sharply and fretfully  or two quarrelsome  coons dispute over  a bit of food they had discovered  all this went with the camping  business  and indeed it would have seemed odd to those boys had the  usual accompaniment been missing      well  what s the use of our staying up longer   max finally announced  in an authoritative fashion  after steve had almost jerked his neck awry  for about the seventh time  with one of those spasmodic movements   our  blankets are calling to us  boys  let s turn in      there was no negative vote recorded  for every one seemed ready to call  it a day  and quit  max took it upon himself to look after the fire   plenty of wood had been gathered to last until morning  and then some   for  as the night air was beginning to feel pretty sharp  it was  concluded to keep the fire going      i ll look out for that part   said max   i generally wake up just so  many times during the night when i m in camp  and it s no trouble for me  to crawl out and toss another stick on the fire  so forget it  fellows   will you      apparently the others took him at his word  for not another sign of any  of them was seen while night lasted  once they snuggled down in their  warm comfortable blankets  they must have become  dead to the world   as  steve aptly termed it     several times while the night held sway a figure would crawl noiselessly  out of the crude brush shanty shelter  and place another lot of wood  upon the dwindling fire  thus keeping it going for another spell of  several hours  of course this was max  who really liked to take an  observation concerning the state of the weather  note the changed  positions of the heavenly bodies  so that he could figure on the  passage of time  and then once more creep into the folds of his blanket  to again fall into a deep sleep     so the night passed     nothing occurred to disturb its serenity  the little four footed woods  folks doubtless prowled all around the boys  camp  eyeing the glimmering  fire with wonder and distrust  for it could not be a familiar sight to  any of them  since mankind seldom visited this inaccessible region so  far removed from the track of ordinary travel  some of the more daring  among them  venturesome  coons or  possums perhaps  may even have  invaded the precincts of the charmed circle  searching with their keen  little noses for traces of castaway food  but  if so  their presence did  not disturb the sleepers within that shelter     so morning came on apace  and presently from the brush shanty one after  another of the fellows came creeping forth  to stretch and yawn and  finally hasten their dressing  for the frosty air nipped fingers and  toes quite lustily     they were in no particular hurry  and breakfast therefore was undertaken  in the best of humor  with plenty of time given to its preparation   everybody seemed to be in the best of humors  and his good sleep must  have smoothed even the spirit of the fretful bandy legs  for he no  longer grumbled or found fault  perhaps  as so frequently happened  he  was secretly ashamed of having shown such a suspicious and  argumentative disposition on the preceding evening  and meant to make  amends for it by an unusually cheery manner     it was determined to  break camp  soon after the matin meal had been  comfortably dispatched  this did not promise to be an extraordinary  feat  since they were trying to go light handed on this expedition  and  did not have many of their ordinary  traps  along  from a tent down to  certain cooking utensils that had been deemed too heavy for  toting   mile after mile into the wilderness     it makes a whole lot of difference just how fellows mean to go  when  laying out the impedimenta for a trip  if a wagon or a boat is  available  all sorts of things may as well be taken along  so as to  insure the maximum of comfort  but when it is known in the beginning  that all they are meaning to use must be packed every mile of the way on  the back of the campers  then it is high time to cut down the list to  the last fraction  so far as weight and bulk are concerned     max and his chums had reduced this down to a real science  for instance   having a comfortable balance at the bank  thanks to their thrift in the  past     money did not enter into their calculations at all   consequently  they had purchased a complete little outfit of aluminum  cooking vessels that nested within each other and weighed next to  nothing  while offering all the advantages of ordinary granite ware   other campers  comforts  too  had been secured  so that they even  carried a certain amount of condensed food in the shape of milk powder   evaporated eggs that could be used to make excellent omelets in case of  necessity  and even soup in double cans  with a layer of unslacked lime  between  which  by the addition of a little water to the lime could be  heated up beautifully without the aid of a fire          in camp on the big sunflower      when all of them started in to get busy  things quickly assumed a  concentrated condition  each article had its regular place where it  would take up the least possible space  why  by now every fellow had  found out just how to do up his pack so that no sharp and uncomfortable  edges would cut into his back  and when this condition has been reached   it means that the last word in packing has been learned     max himself saw to it that the fire was effectually  killed  before they  quitted the scene of their night encampment  this he did by throwing  water on the hissing embers until it was quite dead  if every party that  spends a night in the wilderness took the same pains to put out their  fire on leaving  many a magnificent stretch of timber would be spared  from the ravages of a forest fire  that leaves only blackened tree  trunks behind  and ruins thousands of acres of wooded land every year     although a fire may die down  and seem to have little life in it  there  is no absolute surety unless water be used  that a rising wind may not  fan the embers into renewed activity  until a dangerous spark is carried  into some nest of dead leaves near by  and so the fire starts that  man power can seldom control      three miles  he said  up this stream   observed bandy legs  as they  started gaily forth  max in the lead  and toby bringing up the rear      and as no doubt the said stream meanders considerably in its course   that might mean only half the distance as the crow flies   remarked the  leader  turning once more to look back toward the deserted camp  after  the fashion of a carpenter who considers it wise to measure his post   once again  before applying the saw  because after the deed is done the  parts can never be put together again  but everything seemed still  and  not the faintest whisp of smoke crept lazily upward from the late  camp fire     they walked along for a short distance  and then upon crossing a little  rise  in order to skirt a bad section of marshy ground  it was  discovered that they had a good chance to look backward  a rather pretty  view rewarded their efforts  and as all the boys appreciated nature in  her fall dress  they stood for a minute drinking this in      you can follow the course of the stream for quite a distance  notice    remarked bandy legs   and i even see the place where we yanked steve  here out of that sand      steve frowned as he looked  and max could see that he had gone a little  white  the memory of his harrowed feelings on that occasion would stay  with steve for quite some time  and produce an unpleasant sensation  every time it came before his mental vision     max also saw him shut his teeth very hard together  and was close enough  to even catch a word or two the boy muttered savagely to himself      never again      from that max could judge the lesson had been impressed on steve s mind  indelibly  and that as long as he lived he would be careful how he  entered an unknown stream when fishing  and especially how he became so  engrossed in his sport as to stand a length of time in one spot  without  working his feet up and down so as to make sure they were free from  clinging sand     they chatted from time to time as they proceeded  and of course all  sorts of subjects cropped up to be discussed  sometimes there was a  little good natured dispute concerning something or other  for boys have  different minds  and are apt to view things from various angles  but as  time passed they made such good progress that max presently announced  his belief they must presently glimpse the seven birch trees mentioned  by obed grimes  as marking the place where they were to quit the bank of  the stream     at the time they stopped to look backward max had scanned the country  behind them  looking for some trace of another camp smoke  but seeing  fond of  working his way   and often slipped out of things when he  could manage it  some fellows always do get hold of the smaller end of  the log that is being carried  as if by instinct  though it would be  hardly fair to call them shirkers     they rested for something like ten minutes  then max started up      here s the trail obed told us about   he observed  pointing down at his  feet as though he had been looking about him while recuperating after  that three mile carry   and i guess we might as well be going on  for  one i m beginning to feel quite curious to see that lodge of his under  the pines and hemlocks  as well as learn what he is doing with his fox  farm      bandy legs opened his mouth  and then considered it better not to voice  the question he had on the tip of his tongue  for he shut his jaws tight  together again  and did not speak  max noticing this  it caused him to  smile in quiet satisfaction  that was a very disagreeable habit of  bandy legs  always questioning things  and wanting double proof before  he would put the stamp of his approval on them  and max kept hoping that  in the process of time it could be broken up     it was not difficult to follow the trail  even though at times this  proved to be rather faint and undecided  at least it turned out to be an  easy task with the four chums  simply because they were accustomed to  such things  a greenhorn might have lost the track many times  and made  a none  he had in mind the story told by obed concerning the presence  in the vicinity of another party  and his suspicions concerning their  base intentions  apparently max must have believed what the woods boy  said  even though he could see no sign of a camp that morning      i ve got an idea the seven birches are just over yonder  boys    announced steve  who possessed good eyesight   twice now i ve glimpsed  something white among the thickets of undergrowth  and you can see that  the creek is beginning to swing around so as to lead us in that  direction       g g guess you re about r r right  steve   declared toby jucklin   instantly   to t t tell you the t t truth  i ve been squinting that same  p p patch of white myself q q quite some little time now      it turned out to be just as steve had prophesied  they soon discovered a  bunch of birches growing from the stump of a larger tree that had long  ago fallen under the ax of a woodsman      there are seven  all right  count  em   announced steve with a vein of  exultation in his voice  just as though by right of discovery those  birches really belonged to him      let s call a little rest before we tackle the last round   begged  bandy legs  as they arrived alongside the landmark mentioned by obed   and without waiting for the others to assent he dropped his pack  and  threw himself down on an especially inviting bit of moss  heaving a  great sigh of relief  for be it known  bandy legs was not especially   mountain out of a mole hill   as steve aptly put it  when referring to  the matter     soon they were casting eager glances ahead  under the impression that  they must certainly be drawing near the object of their search  even  bandy legs had by now apparently arrived at the belief that obed was   straight   and that he really did have some sort of home in this  secluded region  the directions had turned out to be exact  from the  three mile tramp along the stream and the  seven birches  count  em   to  the winding trail that led from that point deeper into the woods      looky there  isn t that some sort of high wire fence   demanded steve   suddenly      and  say  i got a plain whiff of sweet hickory wood smoke then  believe  me   added bandy legs  in some excitement  and evidently forgetting that  not long before he had been skeptical regarding the existence of any  lodge or fox farm      well  there s the answer right before you   laughed max  and as they  stared in the direction their leader was pointing  the balance of the  little party saw what seemed to be the  cutest  little cabin fashioned  from sawn logs  and nestling in a happy fashion directly under the  clustering pines and hemlocks  that hung over it most protectingly  as  though with the intention of keeping the winter snows from weighing down  the sloping roof     at one end was a chimney made of slabs of wood  with the chinks filled  in with mud that  in the process of time  aided by the heat of the fire   had become as hard as cement or adamant  and from this there curled  wreaths of lazily ascending blue smoke  the source of that delightful  odor that had drifted to bandy legs s nostrils         chapter vi      the lodge of many wonders     there s obed right now  waving at us from the doorway of his cabin    announced steve  even as they looked at the picture made by the little  log structure nestling so cozily under the dark foliage of the resinous  trees that never lost their green look  even when snow covered the  mountains to the depth of several feet     they hurried forward to join the owner of the woods lodge  who had  evidently expected them to put in an appearance about this time of day   figuring just when they would break camp  and how long it would take  them to make the  carry      he shook hands with each of his new found friends in turn  and warmly   too  even bandy legs seemed to feel that his unworthy suspicions of the  other could have no foundation  to judge from the hearty way in which he  greeted obed     max was quick to see that obed looked pleased at their coming  he also  wondered why the other seemed to raise his eyebrows now and then  and  smile as though certain thoughts he entertained were quite amusing  but   then  seeing what a lonely life the young fur farmer must be leading  so  far away from his kind  and wrapped up in his singular calling  after  all  it was not so queer that he should act in this way  upon having  visitors  and boys of his own age  in the bargain     they were ushered inside the lodge  and here another surprise greeted  them  max in particular was astonished to find that the small building  contained so much in the way of comforts  if he had thought of the  matter at all  he probably expected to find just an ordinary shack  such  as nine boys in ten would be contented with building  and that obed was  putting up with all sorts of discomforts     the contrary proved to be the truth  for there were numerous things in  sight to cause a visitor to express surprise  why  obed even used   aluminum cooking utensils  equal to theirs  though not meant for  camping particularly  there were several rocking chairs  and one big  fireside chair that looked mighty inviting indeed  as it flanked the  broad hearth where obed had a blaze going     the kitchen lay at the back  and actually had a wood stove in it   capable of baking bread or biscuits on occasion  water  too  had been  piped to the cabin from some spring farther up the rise  though  in the  dead of winter a supply must of necessity be obtained from some other  source since this would be frozen up     these things  and many others along the same line  caused max to survey  obed with a new source of wonder  who was this remarkable boy  and how  on earth did he come to possess such a magical lodge up here in the  unpeopled wilderness  why  a rich man could hardly have surrounded  himself with more in the way of comforts  and yet  according to his  language  and his account of himself  obed was only an ordinary child of  the woods  one of the very numerous grimes tribe  many of whom doubtless  gained their living by serving as guides in season     max  after staring around him in due wonder and admiration  turned again  to obed  he could see that the other was observing them with that merry  twinkle in his eyes  and evidently expecting his guests to express  amazement at finding so wonderful a habitation where they had  anticipated so little      its just splendid  that s the only word i can find to express my  feelings  obed   max hastened to say  at which the other laughed aloud      course  now  you all are awonderin  jest how a poor woods boy like me   d ever git hold o  such a clever cabin   he went on to say   but  shucks  that s an easy one to explain  yuh see  it was built by a man  who had plenty o  money and poor health  he thought he could get well by  stayin  here  and so he fixed her up to beat the band  that big chair he  loved to sit in when the fire was agoin   but jest as he got fixed so  nice his wife sent for him to come back home  and  say  he had to go   so  havin  no use for his place here  he turned it over tuh me for a  song  i c n show yuh the bill o  sale  yuh see  i got to know mr  coombs  right well  for he was interested in my ijee o  startin  a fur farm   well  he s dead now  i often think when i m sittin  here enjoyin  what  he built that somehow his spirit must be a hoverin  around  cause he  certainly  did  love this place a heap      the explanation entirely satisfied max  though of course that skeptic of  a bandy legs had to let his eyebrows go up in an arch as he listened   but then bandy legs would doubt anything that savored of the uncommon   max simply frowned at him and paid no more attention to his manner      you were certainly mighty lucky to fall heir to such a lovely little  home as this  obed   steve was saying  with a streak of envy in his  voice   say  i d just be tickled half to death now if i could spend a  month up here with you  there must be plenty of game around  i reckon   and it d be a real delight to keep house in a little palace like this   but how are you going to tuck us away for the night  obed  if i might be  so bold as to ask  seeing that as yet we haven t had an invite to stay  over       oh  that s easily managed   replied the other  with  another of his  queer laughs   you haven t begun to see all the wonders o  this lodge   mr  coombs amused himself for a whole summer havin  it built  he put a  heap o  his own ijees into the same  too  yuh see  he used to be a sea  captain once on a time  and that gave him the notion to have tables that  folded against the wall so as tuh take mighty little room  then seem  as  how he might expect to have company some time or other  look how he  fixed the bunks along the walls      with that obed turned a button that none of them had thus far noticed   fastened on the wall immediately a section slipped down exposing a  cavity beyond that proved to be a regular sleeping bunk  fully capable  of  housing  any ordinary person  it was plain to be seen that his sea  education had given mr  coombs the idea carried out in this remarkable  fashion      beats anything i ever struck   admitted the admiring steve  as he  pushed forward to peep inside the cavity that seemed to offer such a  comfortable bed      but hardly big enough for the whole bunch of us  i m afraid  obed    urged bandy legs  with the idea  of course  of drawing the other out      this is one bunk   said obed  calmly   there are three jest like it  along the two walls  makin  four in all  so yuh see it s jest like mr   coombs  he figgered on my having you all stop over with me some fine  day  then i c n make up a bed on that  ere couch  which is softer  n any  o  the bunks   he  used to sleep  on it all the time  did mr  coombs       well  i must say this is a revelation to me   admitted max  his face  showing how pleased he felt   and you were lucky  as steve here just  said  to fall in with such a fine man as mr  coombs  at the time you  started your fur farm  i suppose it was the interest he took in it that  made him hand over this cabin  when he learned that his plans for  staying here could never be carried out       why  yes  mostly that   agreed obed  turning a little red   p raps i  ought to tell yuh that i chanced to do mr  coombs a little favor when we  first met  yuh see  i happened to come on him in the woods  he d started  out to find a certain kind o  sapling that he wanted right bad to use   and not bein  used to findin  his way around  he jest naturally got  lost  but that wasn t the wust o  it  in using his ax to chop down a  sapling he kim across  what did he do but cut his foot  and it was  bleeding like fun when i ketched his shouts  and kim up  course  i soon  fixed that foot  and since he was only a little dried up speck o  a man  i managed to tote him on my back most ways home here  he chose to think  i d done him a  great  favor  and after that he was always sayin  he  meant to repay me some day  well  he certainly did when he turns over  this here neat contraption at a price that was dirt cheap  and which i d  be ashamed to mention to yuh  that s how it come i got this cabin      how simple the explanation was after all  and how bandy legs must feel  his cheeks burn with shame at the thought of having suspected this same  obed of trying to deceive them  max could easily picture the ex sea  captain seated in that capacious fireside chair with the tufted cushion   and perhaps smoking his long stemmed pipe with the air of a man who  believed he had found what he had long sought  peace and comfort  combined  only to have a summons come that he dared not disobey      make yourselves to hum   said obed  cheerily   here  drop the packs  over in this corner  if later on so be yuh want to git anything out o   the same it ll be easy done  and seein  as i ve got dinner started  i  guess we wont take a turn around the farm till it s been stowed away      although  of course  all of the boys were eager to see what a fur farm  looked like  where those wonderful black foxes that brought such  a big  price in the london markets were being bred in captivity  none of them  objected to sitting down and taking a rest  bandy legs and steve in  particular made a bolt for the big chair  though the latter was too  quick for his competitor  and managed to ensconce himself within its  capacious embrace before bandy legs arrived      start earlier next time  bandy legs   crowed the proud possessor of the  coveted seat  as he spread himself so as to occupy it all   but after  i ve tried it out i ll vacate  because i expect to get busy in that  bully little kitchen  and help friend obed sling the grub for dinner      so bandy legs had to content himself with a seat on the couch  he might  have been observed sniffing the air with avidity  however  as though he  had caught some enticing odor stealing out of the oven of the cook  stove  that was not unlike fresh bread being well browned  and there was  nothing bandy legs loved better than the crust part of a fresh  baking  he always had a compact with the cook at home to save him the   run over  portions  which he looked upon as a prize well worth having     soon obed left them there in the larger room and vanished within the  kitchen  it was a challenge to steve which he could not long resist   bandy legs kept watching him glance toward the connecting doors  his  whole manner was that of a boy who  although making no sound  might be   sicking  one dog on another  no sooner had steve left the capacious  fireside chair than bandy legs slipped into it  and after that he was  not meaning  to be dislodged until the summons came to gather about the  table to discuss the midday meal  bandy legs liked eating as well as the  next one  but he loved his ease more  and was well content to have some  other fellow do the hard work of getting the meal ready  his time would  come when he had to  work his jaws  in disposing of his portion of the  spread     the more max looked about him the greater his wonder became  all manner  of thoughts surged through that active mind of his  he had already  conceived the greatest sort of secret admiration for the extraordinary  woods boy  even before he had glimpsed that remarkable fur farm which  the other was successfully running  plainly  then  this same obed grimes  was bound to be a credit to his family  and all those people bearing the  strange names given by obed would some day find cause to feel proud of  having such an enterprising relative     obed proved to be a pretty good cook  despite the humility with which he  had remarked that of course he could not expect to compete on even terms  with fellows who had had so many better opportunities to acquire the   knack  of things  than had come his way     the bread was as fine as any bandy legs had ever eaten in his own home   where a high priced cook held sway over the kitchen  there was also a  meat pie that seemed delicious  both as to crust and contents  when  opened  though obed in formed them that it was made of canned beef  and  even displayed the recent tin jacket  with its telltale label  as  confirmation to his assertion      yuh see  boys   he remarked  laughingly   i don t want yuh to think i d  poach a deer in the close season  and palm it off as mountain mutton   like they do at some o  the big hotels up here in the adirondacks  i m  told  course i do shoot a deer once in a while in season  and lots o   pa tridges  they bein  so tame yuh c n knock them over as they sit on  the lower limb o  a tree after flushin   i ketch wheens o  trout  too   from time to time  but i give yuh my word i never yet killed anything  when the law was on it  never      when obed said a thing in his emphatic way  he was to be relied on  max  thought  the woods boy could look very sober at times  though  as a  rule  there was that merry gleam in his eye that told how much he loved  a joke     altogether they had a delightful meal  and what was even better  there  was an abundance to give every one three bountiful helpings  which fact  pleased bandy legs and steve in particular  the former  on passing his  plate  for they actually had such articles at this wonderful lodge under  the pines  for the third help  excused himself by remarking aside      it s queer what a  terrible  appetite toting a pack a few miles over a  carry gives a fellow  now  at home i m generally satisfied with one  portion  but once let me get into the harness  and i seem to have no end  of  capacity   say  i d eat you out of house and home  obed  if i stayed  very long at your ranch       no danger o  that  i guess  bandy legs   replied the other  for he had  of course taken quite naturally to calling these new friends by their  customary names  just as boys always do get on quick terms of  familiarity   last time i went to town i laid in quite a wheen o  stuff   then there s always the crick to git trout outen  and in a short time  you could shoot pa tridges without breakin  the game laws  so don t let  that worry yuh any  i m on y too tickled to have some fellers around  it  does git kinder lonely here  sometimes  i own up       whew  i should think it would  obed   said steve  lost in admiration  for the amazing nerve displayed by the woods boy in remaining all by  himself  winter and summer  seldom  if ever  seeing a human face  and  apparently devoting all his energies to making his fur farm experiment  turn out to be a success   nothing would tempt me to stick it out here a  whole winter  why  i d die of the blues  and let the black foxes go to  the dickens  while i made break for the nearest town  so i could hear  the sound of a human voice      obed looked at him gravely  and heaved a sigh      yep  i feels that ways  too  sometimes  steve   he said presently   and  let me tell yuh the temptation is nigh more n i c n stand  but i jest  shuts my teeth together  and tells myself that i started in to do this  job  and i m agoin  to stick it out or know the reason why  then i git  my second wind agin  and it s all right  once i used to give in right  easy  but i m broke now o  that bad habit  i guess          chapter vii      the young magician    the more max listened to obed talk on the one subject that seemed to be  his pet hobby  that of raising valuable fur bearing animals for the  market  the deeper grew his conviction that the woods boy was well worth  studying     he might talk after the manner of an uneducated boy  but max knew that  this could not be the case  even though the main lot of numerous   grimeses  were following the humble occupation of guides amidst the  extensive stretches of the adirondacks  and possibly many of them would  be found to be boors  save along the line of woodcraft  obed had managed  to pick up considerable knowledge  somehow or other     when trying to explain how this idea of successfully raising  silver   black foxes took such a main grip on his imagination  he brought out a  batch of clippings which he had managed to get hold of in some manner   max could not even guess how     some of these were fantastic in their revelations  while others were  authentic interviews with parties who for years had been secretly  engaged in the business of fur farming  this was away up on prince  edward island beyond nova scotia  said to be the place best situated  geographically for the purpose  as these animals require a severe  climate in order that their pelt assumes its richest and heaviest crop   a black fox farm started down in florida would not produce furs worth  offering for sale     max was intensely interested with one account in particular connected  with the extensive pioneer silver fox ranch  he even asked the privilege  of copying the same for future reference  because he knew that  statements he might make later on would be skeptically received by many  people who had never dreamed that any species of furs were so valuable  that young pups could be worth more than their weight in gold     that the boy reader of this story may also stock up with information  that will better enable him to understand what enterprising obed grimes  was trying to do on a small scale  i am tempted to give the main items  in this newspaper article  every word of which is said to be literally  true     since this account was first printed some years ago  other farms along  similar lines have been started away up near calgary  in the canadian  province of alberta  and are said to be doing excellently  one ranch  near midnapore reporting a start with twelve pair  and the pack now  counting thirty seven in all     but here is the main part of the clipping  well worth reading     there is something novel about a ranch which consists of spaces  covering     feet of ground  chappell  now president of the sydney  chamber of commerce  nova scotia  owns seventy pairs of silver black  foxes  and his ranch is split up into small inclosures of that size   covered with wire on four sides  the wire being buried four feet under  ground  attached to a concrete base  and turned in several feet  the  silver black fox tries to root its way to freedom  and this is the way  the breeder prevents his escape     when the foxes mate we also mate a pair of black cats of the ordinary  domestic variety  as soon as the young are born  we take the fox pups  away from the mother fox  and the kittens away from the mother cat  and  make the cat foster mother to the fox cubs  in this way we are able to  rear a more domesticated breed of foxes     for twenty years this business of raising foxes of the silver black  species was really kept under cover  because of its great possibilities  for making big money  with the last four or five years the business has  become organized  and today many millions of dollars are invested in it     the last lot of animals slaughtered was in       there were forty three  pelts sent to london at that time  they brought as high as         the  average fetching         silver black fox is the rarest fur utilized by  man  the russian sable  otter  and south sea seal are practically  eliminated for commercial purposes  due to international laws which  prohibit the killing of these animals for the next ten or fifteen years   so as to give them a chance to increase     only     pairs of live foxes were placed on sale last year  fewer than     of that number were killed and their fur sold  the rest went for  breeding purposes  because fur farms are starting up in many favorable  places  the men who raise silver foxes on prince edward island know the  game  they started in it as boys many years ago      in the provinces of prince edward  nova scotia  and new brunswick  men  and women interested in breeding foxes have been made wealthy  they were  poor people ten years ago  today they live in town houses  own their own  automobiles  and yet continue to give the strictest attention to all the  details connected with their singular farming industry      obed was extremely modest in what he told concerning his own small  beginning  max  having also read in one of the clippings that a pair of  gilt edged silver black foxes were worth all the way up to          was   of course  doubly curious to learn whether those with which obed started  could be the genuine article  and if so  how had he managed to obtain  them     it seemed to be only a game in which rich persons could enter  obed  understood just what must be passing in the mind of the other  and at  the first opportunity he hastened to explain      i was just chock full o  this business   he went on to say   when i  ran across mr  coombs  yuh remember i told yuh about how that came  about  and that he seemed to think i d saved his life   well  he and me  kept house together here for some months  and then one day thar come the  biggest surprise i ever had  he fetched a crate along up from town in a  wagon he hired  and say  inside the same was the finest pair o  silver  blacks i ever saw  then some more wagons begun to show up fetchin  rolls  of wire netting  and bags o  cement to make concrete with  mr  coombs  had gone into the fur raisin  business for keeps  and i was to have an  interest in the game  he had an agreement all written out that both o   us signed before a justice  which fixed things up  half the proceeds o   the fur farm was to come to me  while i stayed here to look after  things      well  sir  we worked like fun to git the stockade built  cording to  form  and our mated pair o  foxes planted in the same  since then i ve  fixed three more enclosures  ready for an increase o  stock  mr  coombs   he called this the lone lodge black fox farm  and i guess the name will  stick even after i get to selling off some o  the product      it was simply wonderful  all of the eager listeners thought  max could  hardly believe his ears  and yet so far as he could make out obed seemed  in dead earnest  besides  he had the documents to prove the truth of his  story  he said  which he would spread before them a little later on     as for that skeptic  bandy legs  he rolled his eyes up many times while  listening  and seemed to be swallowing it with considerable difficulty   toby and steve never questioned the veracity of the narrator  they were  simply amazed at the immensity of the enterprise that had sprung up  almost like a mushroom  over night  millions on millions of dollars  invested in artificial fur farming  and the general public utterly in  the dark concerning the facts until recently  when its scope could no  longer be concealed  like a light hidden under a bushel      and now that you ve kinder got an idea of what a big fur farm might be  like   the singular woods boy went on to say  rising as he spoke    s pose yuh meander out and take a look at my humble beginnin   i surely  hope yuh won t run down my efforts   cause o  course things ain t got to  runnin  full swing yet  but the cubs are nigh big enough to be taken to  market       how many have you got  obed   asked max  following the other out of the  cabin      one pair nearly grown  and another just two months old  i ve been  mighty lucky in not losing a single pup so far   came the reply over  obed s shoulder  and he might be pardoned for putting just a mite of  pride in his tones  for he had accomplished something worth while for a  new beginner at the business      but if you expect to keep in this line   said bandy legs quickly  as  though he voiced a suspicion that kept cropping up in his mind   why do  you want to dispose of that first pair of pups      obed laughed good naturedly      i ll tell yuh  bandy legs   he said  confidentially   in the first  place breeders like to change their stock  so as to bring new blood into  the pens  then again  why  i happens to need the money that s comin  to  me for my share  a fellow has got to live up here in the mountains  and  grub costs a wheen o  hard cash   specially when yuh got a good  appetite  which seems to fit me all right  but if i get what i m hopin   for it ll be all right  and i reckons thar ll come some years before we  let more foxes get away from this same farm      so he took them to where he had his main enclosure  in which the boys  found the parent foxes  they may have become somewhat accustomed to  seeing obed  and hearing the sound of his coaxing voice  for even the  most timid of wild animals in the process of time comes to recognize the  one who supplies their wants along the line of daily food  but possibly  bandy legs or steve chanced to laugh  or speak out loud  for the old  foxes took the alarm  and it was only after constant efforts on the part  of obed  with his familiar call to dinner  that caused them to show  themselves at all     they were certainly beauties  max wondered more than ever at the nerve  of obed in trying to start a silver black fox farm in this section  with  no one save himself apparently in charge  he feared that the enterprise  would be doomed to certain disaster  the smart woods boy might be  successful in raising a crop of valuable youngsters in the fox line  but  sooner or later some unscrupulous men  guides out of a job perhaps  and  loaded with strong drink  would try to make a secret raid on his  preserves  and clean him out in a single night  fox pelts worth  thousands of dollars must tempt some men beyond their fears  or power of  resistance     max made up his mind he would talk about this with obed before he left   he wondered at the short sighted policy of the executor of mr  coombs   estate in allowing so much money to be tied up in this property without  proper safeguards  if it was intended to continue the fox farm now that  it gave all evidences of possible success surely the boy should have an  assistant  some strong woodsman who could by his presence and readiness  to do battle awe any intended transgressors     they next visited the enclosure where the two pair of little foxes  played and slept and ate their fill  daily increasing in size and value   they were also timid  though in due time obed managed to get them to  show themselves  for hunger is a powerful inducement  and the smell of  favorite food a lure difficult to resist      of course   explained the young fur farmer  while they were watching  the inmates of the second enclosure   i don t have black cats up here  yet to carry out them directions exactly  but i m aiming to do that  also pretty soon  yep  and after this set o  pups has been sold  if they  fetch all i count on  i m goin  to have a talk with the lawyer that  looks after mr  coombs  estate  he promised to come up and see what  could be done about extendin  the farm  and then i guess it s goin  to  be time to hire a helper  seein  i can t do everything by myself       that was just what i meant to speak to you about  obed   exclaimed max    you oughtn t to try to stay here another winter all by yourself   besides  some unscrupulous men might raid your enclosures while you were  off hunting  or fishing  and break up your business  it isn t safe   obed  and i know from what you said before about suspecting strangers  were around here right now  that you re getting anxious yourself      the boy drew a long breath  and nodded his head  into his eyes crept a  look quite the opposite of that merry gleam usually nestling there  yes   plainly obed  was  worried over something  and max believed he had put  his finger directly on the sore spot when he spoke of a possible raid on  the fur product of the singular farm      can you find just such a reliable man as you want  obed   asked steve      that part ain t so hard   he was told   fact is i ve got him more n  half engaged a ready  his name is jerry stocks  and he s a woods guide   been a heap interested in this game ever since we started up  fact is   jerry has done a heap o  things for me from time to time   cause yuh  see i couldn t work it all  he lives  bout  leven miles off that ways   we ve fixed a way to signal to each other by flyin  a little white flag  from two low peaks  when i want jerry i run my flag up  and if he s  home  why the next day  or mebbe sooner  he shows up  but shucks  that  wouldn t keep me from losin  my stock if there was a real raid      he went on talking further  and the boys picked up considerable more  valuable information  for obed was apparently well posted on the  subject  which had occupied his thoughts night and day     so he told them that perhaps  if all went well  he might take up a  companion industry  being nothing more nor less than trying to raise  mink or otter in captivity       course i know it isn t done to any great extent yet   he explained    but that s no reason there shouldn t be some ready money picked up in  the business  it wouldn t pay anything like the foxes  and for that  reason i d go slow about it  oh  i ve got a heap o  ways for gettin  the  ready cash to keep up my share o  the expenses o  the farm here  i ve  found two bee trees  and sent the honey to market too  got nigh twenty  dollars for the honey  then i dig ginseng roots times when there s  nothing else to do  come over with me and see my frog pond  last  shipment o  big fat saddles brought me a neat little wad o  money  and  they don t cost me a cent  if yuh want to know it      the four boys looked at each other in increased wonderment  what manner  of chap was this same obed  to be able to wrest a living from a  bounteous nature in the clever way he did  steve in particular was loud  in his praise      why  obed  old fellow   he burst out with   you re just the same kind  of an enterprising chap max here has always been  why  it was his grand  idea about there being mussels aplenty in the big sunflower down our way  that started us into making a try for fresh water pearls in the river   we found  em  too  some thousands of dollars  worth  of them  and when  the news leaked out  whee  the farmers  all around  had a tough time  getting their harvests home  because every hand was treading for mussels  in the creeks and small rivers for thirty miles around carson  why  i  bet you it d be as hard to find a fresh water clam down our way now as a  needle in a haystack  they re all cleaned out  you see  max here had  read about pearls being found out in indiana and other places  and that  gave him the big idea  just like you got set on the fur farm business by  reading about it      they duly inspected the marsh where obed hunted his big greenback frogs  when he thought the crop warranted a thinning out      they re always in demand down new york ways  whar they fetch a dollar a  pound for the saddles   he explained   and let me tell yuh it doesn t  take a great many o  them to weigh that much  i ve got some granddaddy  bouncers here that d make you stare to see  em  but they don t show up  much at this time o  day       and how do you get them by the wholesale when you want to market any    asked steve   i ve shot many a one with a small flobert rifle  or else  caught them with a piece of red flannel fixed on a small hook  attached  by a short cord to a stout pole       well  men in the regular frog raising business couldn t go about it as  slow as that   said the other   though i have shot a few o  the big uns  that way   cause they was too tricky to be grabbed with my hand net  if  you stay with me a spell we ll get more n one mess o  frog legs  if yuh  likes them      bandy legs was seen to work his lips as though his month fairly watered  at the pleasing prospect  for those who are fond of the dish say that  frogs  legs are more delicate than the best spring chicken  with just a  little taste of fish about them that rather adds to the piquancy     having by this time exhausted about all the sights of the wonderful farm  the boys headed back again toward the cabin  max could not but notice  that obed showed signs of uneasiness while away  and cast frequent  glances in the direction where under those whispering pines and the dark  green hemlocks his lone lodge stood     therefore max was not very much surprised when  as he and obed strolled  along in the rear of the other three  who were chatting  and arguing  about certain matters  the young fur farmer pressed his arm  confidentially  and went on to say      i d like to tell yuh something  max   cause i own up it s gettin  on my  nerves  i thought nothin  could bother me any  but now that the time is  so close at hand when i mean tuh sell that pair o  grown pups  and get  the money i need so bad  why  things look kinder different  fact is   max   he went on  allowing his voice to sink into a mysterious stage  whisper   somebody was lookin  around in my cabin while i was down at  your camp last evenin   i know this because things was more or less  upset  and i reckon my comin  back scared the man away  whoever he may  have been          chapter viii      products of the fur farm     that looks bad  obed   max hastened to say  feeling a perceptible  thrill at the very thought of being on hand to assist this enterprising  boy defend his property  which he had made so valuable  through his own  efforts in most part   i saw a smoke last evening  too  which must have  been made by a camp fire  i wondered if there were deer hunters up here  so early  or if some men might be after your foxes  of course that idea  only came to me after you had told us about your enterprise  and how  valuable the pelts were       it s mighty tough   avowed obed  between his set teeth   to be so nigh  success  and then face failure  i ve been tempted to signal for jerry to  come over and help me stand guard a spell  yuh see  i ought to be on my  way to town with that pair o  nearly grown young blacks  i know whar i  c n get more for  em alive than for their pelts if i took the time to  cure the same  which i don t want to do  oh  i ve just  got  to sell   em  and that s all thar is about it  i ve dreamed about the day i d get  that check  and show  er  that lawyer managin  mr  coombs  estate that  all i told him was true  once i have the proof that thar s big money in  raisin  silver blacks  he s promised to do anything in reason i ask      max made up his mind on the spot      look here  obed   was the way he talked  for max always believed that  it was good policy to  hit the nail directly on the head   especially  when the subject was of considerable importance   what s to hinder you  going off with that pair of live blacks  and disposing of them  while  the four of us stay here and run your fur farm for you  it would only  take a few days  and we ve got the time to spare  of course you d have  to trust us to the limit  to leave things in our charge  but we d surely  be pleased to help you out  and depend on it  nobody would steal any of  the other inmates of the pens while we were on deck  we ve got only one  gun along  but that is a repeating marlin  always to be depended on to  do its work      the woods boy was visibly affected by hearing max say this  he reached  for the other s hand and squeezed it almost fiercely      oh  it s kind of you to say that  max   he exclaimed  as though the  words sprang directly from his heart   and d ye know i m tempted to take  you at your word  for i  must  get those pups delivered as i promised   everything depends on that deal  the man saw them three months ago  and  we made a bargain  i was to deliver the pups to him by the time first  snow flew  and it s due any day now  you know      a singular thing had happened  and max  while deeply interested in what  obed was saying  could not help but notice that for once the woods boy  had spoken without a sign of the rude dialect which up to then had  marked his manner of speech  this further aroused the curiosity of max   who to himself was saying      i hit the mark when i guessed obed was smarter than he let on  and  could talk just as well as the next fellow when he chose  he s just  fallen into speaking that way through his association with these rough  people up here  his own folks likely enough  or else he likes to pull  the wool over our eyes  just for a joke      aloud max continued to reassure the other      then consider it as good as settled  obed   he said   that we ll hang  around here a short while  if you think best you can get that jerry to  come over  and keep his finger on the pulse  perhaps it might be wise   too  because he d know just what to do in case there was any trouble  among the foxes left in the pens  and it is all new to us  remember       yuh ve relieved my mind a heap  max  sure yuh have   obed told him   again relapsing into the vernacular that is usually a part of a woods  guide s language   and tonight i ll set the traps i ve got fixed  mebbe  if so be trespassers come a skulkin  around they might git a little  surprise  but i ll show yuh what i m mentionin  later on  jest now i  on y want to tell yuh i m mighty glad i dropped into yer camp last  evenin   stead o  slippin  away  like i fust thought o  doin        but you don t want me to look on this matter as a secret  do you   obed      the other started  max thought  and looked quickly at him      now what might yuh be meanin  by that  max   he presently asked  a bit  anxiously      oh  i only wanted to have your permission to tell my three chums what  you ve been saying to me   explained max   of course i know what their  answer will be when i put it up to them  we ve really come here on what  bandy legs calls a wild goose hunt  for there isn t one chance in ten  that we ll ever be able to find roland chase  so our time is really  pretty much our own  to do with as we will  and obed  all of us have  taken such a big interest in your enterprise up here  that we ll be only  too happy to lend you a helping hand  you are so near success now that  it d be a shame if you fell down through no fault of your own       that s what i keep tellin  myself too  max  don t you know   exclaimed  the now excited obed   i ve hugged that hope close to my heart month  after month  and now when i c n almost whiff the success i ve prayed for  it d nearly kill me to lose everything  oh  i jest wants a couple of  weeks at the most  and then i ll show  em  yes  i will  they all said  i d make a dead failure out o  my fur farm  but yuh c n see it s comin   along right smart      when they reached the cabin the boys threw themselves down on the soft  yielding turf near by to  loaf  as bandy legs properly expressed it  and  surely he could do this as well as any boy who ever drew breath     max took occasion to tell the others what he and obed had been talking  about  all of them were deeply interested  they looked angrily at each  other when max explained how the woods boy had found traces of some  intruder who had actually entered his lone cabin while he  obed  was  away in their company  also telling how the other strongly suspected  that a dastardly plot had been hatched  looking to the robbing of the  pens connected with the silver fox fur farm     obed was inside doing something at the time  and so max felt that he  could talk freely  he meant that his three chums should know everything  in the beginning  before he called on them to decide whether they would  stay over a few days  and guard the property  while obed was marketing  his first proceeds in a distant city  for the pups were really too  valuable to be trusted to the tender mercies of an express company  obed  thought      i don t exactly understand how obed knows that there  is  a conspiracy  hatched up against him  to complete the ruination of his enterprise    continued max   but he seems to think some party has a deep grudge  against him  it may be we ll know more about this later on  but for the  present i ve promised obed i d put up a proposition to you       then let s hear it  max   exclaimed touch and go steve   though i  reckon we c n all give a pretty close guess at what s coming       why  obed wants to get away with that pair of grown pups  so he can  deliver them to the man he s bargained with  and i ve proposed that we  stay here a few days  and guard his property while he s off  is there  any objection to that plan  i told him i expected i could count on my  chums to stick by me       i should say you could  max   chuckled bandy legs   why  i m fairly  counting on depopulating that big frog marsh while we re hanging around  this section  and say  steve here could keep us supplied with trout  galore  if only he fished from the bank  and didn t wade in      both the others were equally prompt to agree  indeed toby  fell all over  himself   as steve termed it  in his eagerness to give assent  and could  only recover after coming to an abrupt halt  taking one of his customary  big breaths  and then giving a sharp whistle  after which he finished  what he was saying as nicely as anything     and that settled it  just as max had been confident would be the case   for he knew his chums too well to believe they would be willing to let  such a brave fight be lost when the goal seemed so near  obed grimes had  proved to be a fellow after their own hearts  and they found themselves  deeply interested in his fortunes     so when the woods boy came out again  max suspected that he had  purposely withdrawn from the scene in order not to embarrass them while  making their decision  he was told how they all felt  and obed went  around shaking hands  with the tears in his eyes  plainly he had his  whole heart wrapped up in the successful outcome of this odd venture   and when the clouds began to loom up overhead this proffered assistance  on the part of the four chums was gratefully received      this is mighty nice o  yuh  boys   he kept telling them  as though  really at a loss for appropriate words best calculated to express the  state of his feelings   and i ain t goin  to ever forget it  either  now  i feel that i c n start out right away  the day after tomorrow  and  deliver them pups to mr  sheckard  say  mebbe i won t be a proud boy  when he hands me that big check  and i know that i ve won out against  all odds      his eyes glowed at the very thought  and max was more than glad he and  his comrades had the chance to render so resolute a chap slight  assistance  for it would really be a pleasure for them to stay there at  that wonderful little lodge under the whispering pines  and keep house  while obed was away  then  too  jerry would be on hand  ready with his  advice and knowledge  so as to do the proper thing  as to any rash  prowler stealing the valuable foxes  day or night  well  they would see  to it a constant watch was kept  and that the gun was always ready to  block any nasty little game like that     later on  max amused himself lolling in mr  coombs  big fireside chair   which he had moved near one of the windows  he had run across a number  of books on a shelf  and was engaged in looking them over  though hardly  bothering to actually read  nevertheless  he seemed to be quite curious  concerning them  and when obed chanced to come in  max naturally asked  concerning the volumes      oh  yuh see  some o  them belong to me   the woods boy remarked   without hesitation   and t others they were left here by mr  coombs  he  was a great reader  and besides  he d traveled all over the known world   yuh remember i said he was a sea captain  and that he made his fortune  carryin  cargoes from the far east to england and america  sometime i ll  tell yuh a few of the queer adventures he had in foreign countries   they ve got lots o  thrills about  em  too       just so   ventured max  casually   and i once heard some people talking  about a mr  coombs who had been a great traveler  now i wonder if it  could have been the same party  was his first name robert       oh  no   my  mr  coombs  name was jared   replied the other  promptly      then  of course  it could not have been the same   added max  smiling  as though he had attained the object of his questioning   but the  similarity in names  and the fact that both men had traveled  considerably  made me think it might  be so      he once more dipped into the book he was holding  although watching obed  slily over the top of the volume  and when the woods boy had passed  outside again  max hastings might have been seen to hurriedly turn back  to the blank pages at the front of the book  scan several initials that  were plainly written there  and then nod his head mysteriously  with a  smile that gradually crept across his whole face  just as though  something pleased him  which  for the time being  he chose to keep to  himself         chapter ix      laying plans to help obed    it was only natural that steve  always headstrong and impulsive  should  be eager to find out what kind of plan might be arranged looking to  keeping watch and ward over the fur farm during the nights to come  he  had been impressed with the signs of anxiety which obed plainly  betrayed  when speaking of his belief concerning some sort of plot being  hatched up against his peace of mind  and which would bring about the  ultimate ruination of his unique and intensely interesting undertaking     to steve  the idea of a miserable rascal sneaking up in the night to  destroy all that poor hardworking obed had built up after many moons   was simply terrible  the more he considered it the greater became his  secret anger  and of course this meant that his liking for the boy fur  farmer grew in proportion     during the afternoon  as the shadows began to lengthen perceptibly   steve found occasion to broach the subject to his three chums  max had  come out of the cabin  evidently he had tired of looking over the books   which might do very well to pass away a long evening  or a rainy day  when time dragged  but could not chain him down long when the sun was  shining  the breeze rustling through the many colored leaves still on  the trees  and with all nature beckoning     so steve crooked his finger toward bandy legs and toby  lounging near  by  and being in a humor themselves for any sort of thing  the pair  hastened to join him  and max  upon being pounced upon by the balance of  the crowd  looked askance  knowing that something was in the wind      strikes me  fellows   commenced steve   that we ought to be figuring on  what we expect to do tonight       huh  as for me   quickly responded bandy legs   i m expecting to do my  share about slingin  together a dandy spread  with some of the fine grub  we fetched along  this mountain air is something terrible when it comes  to toning up  jaded appetites   i feel as if i had a vacuum down about  my middle all the time  i m beginning to be alarmed about my condition   if it keeps on it s going to mean bankruptcy for my folks  that s all       about me  now   added toby jucklin  briskly   i m hoping to g g get a  b b bully g g good sleep tonight  unless max fixes it so we have to  t t take t t turns standing sentry duty      steve looked disgusted      oh  rats  i didn t mean anything like that  and you both know it   he  told the two grinning chums   what i was referring to was on the point  of duty  we ve agreed to stand back of our new friend  obed  and see to  it that he isn t robbed of the proceeds of his industry by unscrupulous  scoundrels  and we ve got to make good       hear  hear   ejaculated toby  pretending to clap his hands in applause      steve  you re exhausting all the big words in the dictionary  with your  high flown language   warned bandy legs in mock severity   but i get  your meaning  all the same  and i also agree with your noble sentiments   sure we re expecting to stand up for obed and his pets  and we re  likewise intending to make it hot for any old terrapin who comes  creeping around here with the idea of making way with the wearers of  that expensive fur  how about it  max       that s a settled thing   readily replied the one appealed to  and whose  opinion  it was plain to be seen  would swing things one way or another   since the other fellows were in the habit of looking up to max as their  leader   we can fix it up in regular orthodox style  each fellow having  two hours on duty  and the rest of the night for sleep  does that strike  you as about right       well   remarked steve  proudly   it won t be the first occasion when  this bunch has had to stand guard  not by a long sight  i can look back  and see many a night when we had to keep an anchor to windward  or else  lose something we prized a heap  ever since we dug up all those mussels  in the big sunflower  and found dandy pearls inside some of them  it  seems to me we ve had occasion from time to time to be envied by other  people  and had to keep watch so we wouldn t be robbed  oh  standing  sentry is an old trick with us       for my p p part   remarked toby  yawning as he spoke   i d much rather  think up some g g good s s scheme that would ease the s s strain  and  allow us to s s sleep through the entire night       please explain what you mean by saying that  toby   demanded steve    you do get off the most mysterious communications sometimes  and muddle  us all up       but there isn t anything q q queer about this  steve   protested toby    all of you know i ve been a g g great h h hand to make m m machinery  take the place of h h hand power  what s the need of our s s staying  awake p p part of the night  even  if by cudgeling our brains we  c c could think up some g g good s s scheme that would answer the same  purpose       i can see  you  cudgeling your poor brains  all right  toby   sneered  steve  who apparently did not take a great deal of stock in the other s  ability for conceiving clever ideas   and a pretty mess you d make of  it  in the bargain  take it from me  they re cudgeled enough as it is       that will do for you  steve   said max   i understand just what toby  means  and it s along the right line too  this is the age of progress   and up to date people don t want to depend on the old time methods that  were good enough for their grandfathers  toby thinks one of us might  suggest a scheme whereby we could guard the fox farm  and at the same  time obtain our full quota of sleep  in other words  rig up a dummy to  stand our trick as sentry  isn t that it  toby       j j just what i had in my mind  max   snapped toby   and any silly  c c could easy see that       sure  and the wise ones had to be told   chirped steve  jauntily   but  never mind arguing  toby  it s all right  and i m only joking  i get the  idea  and now  has any one a scheme on tap that would apply to the  case      toby scratched his head as though he considered that  having been the  first to make the suggestion  it was up to him to say something  no  matter how      well  there s the spring gun trap  you know   he remarked  without once  stuttering  which fact proved that he was deliberately taking his time  about answering      what sort of arrangement do you call that  i d like to know   asked  steve      s s say  you a hunter  and never heard about the s s spring gun trap    exclaimed toby  scornfully   well  i ll try to explain  if you give me a  little t t time  and don t r r rush me too much  you see  a gun is  f f fastened to the ground  and aiming along a certain avenue that the  intended thief has just g g got to use in c c coming up to the b b bait   then a c c cord is s s strung so the thief p p presses against the  s s same  just like max here fixes his c c camera nights  when he wants  to s s snap off a skunk or a  coon by flashlight  well  the g g gun goes  off  and f f fills mister thief with number twelve birdshot  when you  hear the c c crash  and his howls  why  you just s s saunter out and  f f fetch in the s s spoils  there  do you understand about the  s s spring gun trap now  steve       oh  i knew all that before  only you mixed me up by giving it that  name   the other hastily replied   but it strikes me that d be a pretty  rough deal for us to play  it might answer if the thief were an animal   but a human being is different       all the same   retorted toby  savagely   he s a t t thief  and outside  the p p pale of the law       just so   steve went on  and max was surprised at his moderation   because  as a rule  steve had always been the most reckless one of the  crowd   but suppose now we found that we d done more than we calculated  on  toby  a charge of small birdshot starts out on its errand a whole  lot like a bullet  it doesn t commence to scatter till it gets just so  far away from the muzzle of the gun  depending on the size of the bore   and the way the barrel is choked  i ve known a charge of shot to tear a  hole right through a board when fired at close range  at a distance it  would only have scattered out  and peppered the whole fence  and  toby   we might feel rather bad if we found we d killed a man  even if he was a  thief      toby did not answer to that fling  the truth of the matter was he  shivered at the gruesome picture steve s words drew before his mental  vision  for toby was not at all bloodthirsty     max now took a hand in the conversation      listen  fellows   he went on to say   it strikes me that when we set  about discussing this matter  we ought to remember that there s one chap  who s considerably more interested in the outcome than any of us can  ever be        course you mean obed when you say that  max   ventured bandy legs      he s the one   the other admitted   and we ought to invite him to join  us in figuring out our plans  now  it may be obed will have a scheme of  his own that d knock any we might think up all silly  i ll call him  over  and tell him what we re trying to arrange      it happened that just then obed was passing on his way to the cabin  he  had been working somewhere amidst his enclosures  perhaps making certain  preparations for insuring the safety of his valuable furry pets  should  a descent on the farm come about during the hours of darkness     obed hastened to join them  his questioning look influenced max to  explain without hesitation  and the woods boy smiled broadly when he  heard how his new found friends were already taking so decided an  interest in his fortunes      now  it might be   he started to say  again looking serious   that all  this fuss ain t worth the candle  and that nothin   s going to happen   but i believe in shuttin  the door  before  the hoss is stolen  it s too  late afterwards  i haven t got the time right now to tell yuh jest how i  learned that my foxes was agoin  tuh be in danger  somebody i knew wrote  me a letter  and warned me  which ll have tuh be enuff jest now tuh  explain  since i got that same  three days back  i ve been figgerin  on  how i could fix up a trap tuh ketch any two legged varmint that chanced  tuh come sneakin  around here of a night  well  i got one er two tricks  rigged up that might fill the bill       of course you mean to show them to us  obed   steve burst out with    for if you didn t  and we were left in charge here  one of us might  fall into the pit  and get knocked out  which would be tough luck  i m  thinking       oh  i meant to show you  steve   asserted the fur farmer  quickly   and  if so be yuh ll come along with me right now  we ll take a look at the  contraptions  which  of course  yuh understand  are only meant for  night times  and tuh help out when jerry wouldn t be around for me to  sorter lean on      being boys who did things themselves  it was only natural that the four  chums should feel a decided interest in what obed had just said  even  max showed an eagerness to go forth and examine the said traps  he could  speculate as to what their character might turn out to be  but this  only added a little more spice to the occasion     so when obed turned and started off  with a beckoning finger that  enticed them to follow his lead  none of the quartette held back         chapter x      traps fob night prowlers     yuh see   remarked obed  turning around as they drew near the first  enclosure  where the parent foxes were confined behind the wire fencing    i ve just been adding a few finishing touches tuh this here trap  scheme  i got a little idea while i was alookin  the ground over  and  reckoned i could fix it up so there d be a heap right good chance that a  feller creeping around here o  a night would step into the contraption   i ll show yuh how i  ranged it      with that he led the way along a plain trail that seemed to be the  easiest route up to the enclosure  three times out of four a stranger   prowling around with meagre light to guide him  would be apt to follow  that beaten track  and this was evidently what the shrewd obed was  counting on      well  it s this way my little scheme is agoin  to work   he explained   after reaching a certain point   see this rope  i throw it across a limb  o  this tree  yuh notice that it s got an easy runnin  slip noose at the  end  don t yuh  that i m fixing right here  where there s a good chance  the thief will put his foot in it as he takes this step i m showing  you      he proved that he was right  and indeed it was really a difficult  thing  after obed had placed the noose just as he wanted it  close to  the ground  and on little wooden crotches he had arranged there for the  purpose  for any one to step across without getting his foot entangled  in the rope      well  let s reckon  then  he does get caught in the noose  and jerks it  tight around his ankle   continued obed  very much interested himself in  what he was saying  and as max quickly noticed  even neglecting to speak  as he usually did  although he had shown this odd trait before   what  happens  i ll show you how it s going to work out  if everything runs as  i ve planned      accordingly  he picked up a heavy piece of wood that chanced to be lying  close by  and which doubtless obed had used before in order to test the  accuracy of his figuring  this he inserted in the noose  and then gave  it a hunch that not only tightened the rope but carried out the further  purpose of the inventor     instantly things began to happen  the boys heard a queer rattling sound  near by  and immediately the wooden  dummy  was jerked out of obed s  hands  to be drawn up until it struck against the limb of the tree fully  ten feet above  steve gave a whoop      my stars  but that worked like a charm  obed  let me tell you  greased  lightning could hardly be quicker than the way you ve arranged your  trap  and what was all that rattling sound about  what s holding on to  the other end of the rope  which pulled the log up on the run  i want to  know  even if i ain t from missouri      the woods boy laughed as though quite pleased because his trap had  worked well enough to call forth such words of praise from these new  friends      come over and see   he simply said     they followed the line of rope  now taut  and resembling a huge  fiddle  string   as bandy legs remarked  testing it as he passed along  it led  them to the brow of an abrupt little descent  a sheer drop of perhaps  twenty feet  down this slope they followed the rope with their eyes and  then discovered it was attached to a large and heavy barrel that could  almost be called a hogshead  evidently something which had been used as  a crate to convey a portion of the previous owner of the cabin s  crockery ware thither when he moved up from town     as the boys were no simpletons  they readily grasped the essential  qualities of obed s little scheme  it may have been original with him   and then again possibly he had borrowed the same from some book he had  read  but  nevertheless  it struck them as pretty clever     not content with the heaviness of the big barrel  he had placed a number  of stones inside so as to add to the swiftness of its flight down that  declivity  once it was released  the rope acted as  starter   and upon  being jerked  as must be the case  should any one get a foot caught in  the noose  it released a stake that kept the heavy barrel poised there  at the top of the descent  the consequence was that it would plunge  downward almost as though making a sheer drop  the noose tightening  about the leg or legs of the unhappy wight who had sprung the trap  he  would be jerked off his feet and hauled up  head downward  to dangle  there in midair  as helpless as a babe      set it again  and let me try the trick  please  obed   pleaded steve   who seemed to be particularly charmed with the arrangement      i will if yuh help me git the barrel back up the hill again   replied  the other   workin  all by myself i ve had tuh take the rocks out each  time before i could push the old thing back again tuh the top   cause  she s some heavy  believe me      steve  yes  and both bandy legs and toby also  hastened to comply with  this reasonable request  and between them all the heavy barrel was  slowly pushed up again until the stake held it poised there on the top  of the sharp declivity     max stood and watched operations  not that he was unwilling to lend a  hand also if necessary  but just then he wanted to observe obed  and  draw certain conclusions in which he  max  seemed to take considerable  interest     then steve was given the wooden  dummy  which had worked so like a  charm  and instructed how to manage it  so that it would take the place  of a man s lower extremities  steve did so well that he  too  by a  little jerk displaced the delicately arranged  trigger  as obed called  the stake  and caused the barrel to pitch furiously down the steep  slope     steve had not been quite quick enough to snatch his hands away  after  working the trick  the consequence was that when the billet of wood was  plucked from his grasp with such swiftness  and drawn instantly aloft   steve staggered  and might have fallen only that obed clutched hold of  him      wow  did you see that   gasped steve  staring upwards at the dangling   dummy  as though he could easily imagine it a kicking  squirming human  figure   and say  it worked as fine as silk  didn t it  obed  you ve  done yourself proud with this little game  if that thief ever gets a  foot in your slip noose his goose will be cooked  that s as plain as  dirt      he actually seemed to be very proud of the fact that he had acted as  master of ceremonies  and set the trap off so successfully  nothing  would do but that bandy legs and toby jucklin in addition should be  given the same distinction  so twice more was the barrel rolled up the  slope  and on both occasions it worked to a charm      it seems to be next door to perfect  for a fact   asserted max  upon  being appealed to for his opinion  but he did not seem to  hanker  after  trying it out on his own account     finally the weighted barrel was again pushed up to its appointed  position and held there with the stake  when the proper time came  it  would be easy for the inventor to arrange the slip noose  and set the  trap      what  is there anything more to be shown   asked steve  when obed asked  them to follow him a little further     a few minutes later and they were gravely examining an odd arrangement  which consisted for the most part of a very heavy log  steve looked it  over critically  and then ventured to give his opinion      looks a whole lot like a deadfall trap  such as they use in most places  to get bears in   he went on to say     obed chuckled as though pleased at the answer to his look of inquiry      just what it is built on the pattern of  steve  if yuh want to know  it   he admitted   the only difference is that in the regular deadfall  the log comes down and smashes the poor bear by its sheer weight  now   i ve tried to rig  my  trap up so it ll simply make a prisoner o  the  creeper  i ll show yuh just how it works  i ve got a dummy here  too   that i use to test things  yuh see there s always just a little chance  it might go wrong  and i don t want to get caught  and made a prisoner   with nobody around to let me loose      with that he demonstrated his idea  the trap was sprung just as he meant  it should be  and if the dummy had really been a man  he would have  found himself caught tightly in the log trap  with but a poor chance of  ever getting out again  unless external assistance came along      any more tricks like these two up your sleeve  obed   asked steve   after they had further examined the deadfall  and max had pronounced it  skillfully constructed      well  i m afraid i reached the end o  my rope when i hatched up this  second idea  steve   the other remarked  in a sort of apologetic tone    of course i might think up a few more if i reckoned it d be necessary   but i ve got a hunch that one o  the lot is agoin  tuh grab that thief   providin  he does come around here  besides  when yuh git right down to  brass tacks  thar isn t as much danger o  my bein  robbed in the  night time  as in the day       and why not  obed   further asked steve   i d think that was the very  time you d feel scariest  when it was dark  and you couldn t see if  anybody was prowling around the farm       stop an  think how foxes have holes in the ground  into which they c n  burrow when scared the least mite   explained obed  readily   and yuh ll  see how hard it d be for a stranger to lay hands on them  now  in the  daytime  if they came along  with me away from the place  a man with a  rifle could knock over my pets as easy as turnin  his hand  but  all the  same  i ve fixed my traps  for one thing i d like to find out jest who  the thief is      max noticed what emphasis he put on that last remark  he could see the  customary twinkle in obed s eyes give way to a sterner look  as though  he had brooded more or less over this same subject  and max himself  nodded his head as though he might in a measure understand just how obed  felt     so they returned to the house  bandy legs at least rejoiced because with  all those clever contraptions set  and waiting to give the intended  thief a warm reception  it did seem as though there would be hardly any  necessity for them to waste their precious time in sitting up and  keeping watch  when they would be so much better off enjoying  balmy  sleep   as he called it  and all sleep was along that order  according  to the mind of bandy legs     max and steve trailed along well in the rear  this may have simply  happened  but steve twice stopped the other  and pointed out something  he wished max to see  so possibly the delay was intentional on his part   at least  he presently made a remark that would make it seem so      it certainly looks as if obed was a pretty ingenious maker of snares   that s sure  max   steve was saying  significantly      that s right  he is  steve  and we must give him great credit for it   even if his traps fail to catch a thief in the act       i was just thinking  max   pursued the other  meditatively   that it s  evident this same obed must have inherited that strain from a long line  of trapper ancestors or progenitors  wouldn t you think so  too      max looked at his companion queerly  and smiled as he made reply      you may be right  steve  of course  but it strikes me obed has an  original streak of genius all his own  which doesn t have to depend on  any inherited trait  things are not  always  what they seem in this  world  you know       lookey here  max  you ve struck a scent which you don t think best to  share with your boon companions  that s as plain to me as two and two  make four  you ve come to think a little the same way as bandy legs   perhaps  and suspect obed of being more than he lets on  is that it   max  do you really believe he s playing some sly trick on us  is that  yarn about mr  coombs all moonshine  does this fur farm belong to some  company  that obed is working for  i wish you d tell me what you ve got  in your mind  max       i expect to a little later on  steve  never fear   he was assured   i m  not more than half certain even now that it can be so  and i never like  to make a mess of things  besides  you know  it wouldn t be just fair to  obed to have us all suspecting him of playing tricks  just go on as  you ve been doing  take my word for it  this new friend we ve made is  all to the good  and will never turn out to be the wrong sort of  fellow      he started on after saying this  and steve followed  looking very much  puzzled  and shaking his head as though he could not catch the right  idea  shortly afterwards  however  steve had apparently forgotten his  newly awakened suspicions  for he was entering into the general  conversation as heartily as ever  still  max noticed  with amusement   that from time to time steve would follow obed hungrily with his eyes   and on such occasions that double line of wrinkles  expressive of  bewilderment  might again be seen upon the boy s forehead     toby and bandy legs were only too glad to take the preparation of supper  into their hands completely  they felt a certain amount of pride in  their culinary skill  and wished to show their host the full list of  their accomplishments as camp cooks  besides  they believed that among  their abundant stores they carried a number of things which obed failed  to possess  and of course a new dish was apt to be a pleasant surprise  to the woods boy     the supper thus concocted and carried out was certainly a genuine  triumph  steve openly congratulated the two efficient cooks on their   masterly skill   though max laughingly warned the others to  beware of  the greeks bearing gifts   for there might be a base motive hiding  behind all that glib praise  steve protested that he meant every word of  it  but then it was well known that steve hated to do any cooking  himself  and hence was fain to laud the efforts of others in that line   doubtless in the hope of encouraging them to  keep right on doing it      after the bountiful meal had been enjoyed  and every one declared that  it would be utterly impossible to eat another single bite  for fear of  the consequences  they spent a very enjoyable evening alongside the fire  that burned on the hearth  at one end of the cabin     obed  as he had promised  told them some of the strange things he had  heard from the old sea captain  who  during his life on the seven seas   had met with many most remarkable adventures well worth repeating     obed addressed them in his own language  and max often smiled as though  some of the quaint expressions used by the young narrator amused him   though perhaps there may have been still another reason for his quiet  chuckling  steve caught him at it several times  and eyed the other in  perplexity  as though he suspected max of adding secretly to his fund of  knowledge  which thus far he obstinately declined to share with his  mates     later on  when they began to feel sleepy  obed said he would go out and  make sure his traps were set right  max offered to keep him company  and  together they sauntered forth  to be followed with a wistful look from  the envious steve  who was muttering to himself      i wish i knew what max has got in that mind of his right now  i m dead  certain he s figuring out some sort of thing that s going to give the  rest of us a big surprise  when he sees fit to spring it on us  but for  the life of me i can t guess what it can be  oh  shucks  what s the use  of bothering any more about it  if it turns out worth while  max will  tell us in good time  and if he s on the wrong scent  why  he ll just  drop the game  and no harm done      after a while the others came in again  saying both traps were set  and  there did not seem to be any need of their losing sleep on account of  possible unwelcome visitors  obed showed how the concealed bunks could  be made ready  and  all of them were loud in their expressions of  satisfaction over having such comfortable lodgings for the night  they  mentally blessed the memory of the said mr  coombs  whose forethought  and inventive ingenuity had planned all these wonderful adjuncts of the  little forest lodge     in due time they crept into their several berths just as if aboard ship   and after that several of the fellows did not know a single thing until  they were rudely aroused  perhaps some hours later on  the last thing  steve remembered hearing as he rolled himself up in his blanket was the  crackle of the fire  the mournful sighing of the wind through the tops  of the whispering pines  and then the distant call of an owl to its  mate     he awoke with a suddenness that caused him to sit up  and consequently  crack his head against the boards above his bunk  the blow almost  knocked steve back again as he had been before  and must have hurt  considerably  but he ignored this fact just then  because from without  there were coming loud yells of fright in a man s voice         chapter xi      a tree that bore strange fruit     max  obed  we ve got something   almost shrieked steve  as he now  tumbled out of his odd bunk very much after the fashion of a dislodged  log  landing with a bump on the floor     and steve was not alone in his circus stunt  for several other fellows  were making a hasty and undignified exit at the same time  bandy legs  and toby jucklin  for instance  max somehow managed to get on his feet  without so much scrambling  and as for obed  as he had been sleeping on  the cot closer to the fire  they could already see him hastily pulling  on some clothes      get dressed  and in a hurry   cried max  suiting his actions to the  words      oh  listen to him whoop it up  will you   exclaimed bandy legs  as  those loud calls still smote the night air  and in a way that covered  the whole gamut of human utterance     toby wanted to say something  too  but though his jaws worked  no  audible sound came forth to explain the agitated state of his mind  they  had luckily prepared for such a sudden call  and had their outer clothes  handy  so that in an incredibly brief space of time all of the boys  managed to get something on     then steve snatched up his marlin gun  obed had already done the same  with his rifle  so that when the latter flung wide the door and they  trooped forth  they were in a condition to do battle if necessary  and  at least strike terror into the heart of any skulking marauder     max  wise general that he was  had thought of something very essential  to their success  this was nothing more or less than a lantern  they had  been thoughtful enough to fetch one along  a clever little contraption  that took only a small amount of room  and yet afforded considerable  light  besides  obed possessed a lantern of the ordinary type  together  with a plentiful supply of oil  looking to the long winter evenings when  he might want to read in order to pass away some of the spare time  that  promised to drag heavily on his hands     so they poured forth  the cries still continued  and as vociferous as  ever  indeed  if anything  there was a wilder strain to them now  as  though the fellow who gave utterance to the shouts might be getting  sorely alarmed at his strange condition  and feared the worst     there was no trouble about deciding which way to go  even if they did  not have obed to serve as guide  and pilot the expedition  they could  easily have followed the loud notes of alarm     everybody was more or less excited  from obed down to max himself  and  small wonder when the fact of their being aroused in the dead of the  night by this fierce racket is taken into consideration     hastening in this manner toward the spot where the first trap had been  set  they speedily discovered that the overhanging tree bore strange  fruit  something grotesque was swinging violently back and forth  it was  a human figure  but hardly recognizable as such  on account of the fact  that it now hung head downward  with one leg firmly gripped by the  tenacious slip noose  and the other  together with a pair of wildly  flung arms  cutting all sorts of eccentric circles through the air     never in all their varied experiences had max and his three comrades  looked on a more remarkable spectacle than the one by which they were  now greeted  the man s face could not be plainly seen on account of his  coat sagging down partly over his head  so they could not immediately  tell what he looked like  but he certainly possessed a bull like voice  that  properly trained for opera use might have won him a fair amount of  fame and money  for it was more than usually lusty     he seemed to divine the fact that those in the cabin must have rushed  out in answer to his shouts  perhaps he detected the light they carried  with them  or it might be steve s loud cries caught his strained hearing  at such times as his own breath temporarily failed him      help me  somebody  why don t yuh  i m strangling to death  i tell yuh   all the blood s running to my head  i m seeing a million stars already   and i ll  die  if yuh don t cut me down  hurry  hurry  please do   somebody      obed looked to max to say what ought to be done  for already he seemed  to have come under the magical sway of the other s leadership      take hold of him  and tie his hands behind his back before you think to  let him down   was the sensible advice given by max     thereupon obed instantly produced some heavy cord and started  operations  while the boy deftly worked  the man continued to plead   trying to claw at him also  but obed managed to get his job completed  notwithstanding the interruptions  he was at the same time telling the  unfortunate man to keep quiet  and he would be let down presently     steve stood by  gun in hand  he was casting uneasy looks around as  though suspecting that if the fellow had companions near by  as seemed  likely  and they should  recovering from  their alarm attempt his  rescue  it might be his duty to stand them off one and collectively     bandy legs and toby sprang to where the man dangled  max was already at  the side of obed      all ready  obed   he was heard to say      i ve spliced his hands up in good style  max   came the reply      good enough  now  toby and bandy legs  take hold of him  and lift when  i give you the word  i ll slip the rope off his ankle  and you turn him  right side up  now  go to it  both of you  yo heave o      it was quickly done  and the man  upon finding himself placed once more  on his feet  staggered  indeed  he was so  groggy  after his recent  strange experience at swimming in thin air  that only for the supporting  arm of max he would have fallen flat     the latter allowed him to stagger backward until he leaned against the  body of the tree under which the novel man trap had been arranged  he  was breathing hard  but seemed to be recovering from his panic  at least  his cries had utterly ceased  which was one good thing     so max flashed the light into his face  while obed leaned forward and  eagerly stared hard at him  they saw rough lineaments  seamed and  hardened by exposure to the elements  but of course the face was that of  an utter stranger to max  as for obed  he was heard to give a  sigh  of  disappointment  as though he too had failed to recognize any one whom he  had reason to know     the man by now seemed to have recovered in part  he was looking at the  boys in a peculiar way  max could not decide on the spur of the moment  whether it was wonder or shrewdness that he saw there as the predominant  trait of the man s features  but at any rate  since he had recovered his  breath to some extent  he should be capable of speaking  and explaining  how it came about he found himself in such a predicament      well  who are you  anyway   demanded max  throwing as much sternness  into his voice as he could   give an account of yourself  and tell us  why you were creeping about here like a thief in the night       what  me a thief   shrilled the man  as though  again excited by the  very idea of such a base accusation   i never had that name  young  feller  them that knows jake storms say he s an honest man  if ever  there was one  i m only a guide  and a trapper  but nobody ever yet  caught me thievin  or poachin   i d have yuh know       where s your home  jake storms   continued max      if yuh mean whar do i hang out  it s this way   explained the other    last summer i was up at paul smith s place  workin  for the hotel  i  heard some tall stories about the country around old mount tom  how full  of fur animals it was  and so i made up my mind to spend the winter  hereabouts  i built me a cabin away up on the other side of the  mountain  and was agoin  to start settin  my traps when i got word that  a gentleman wanted me to come down to lathrop and git him  yuh see  his  doctor advised that he spend the winter in the mountains  and he thought  of me  beca se we d been in the woods a heap of times in past years  so  i was headin  for lathrop by a trail i d run across that took around the  mountain  and meanin  to keep on as long as i could durin  the night   when all at once something flew up and hit me ker slap  say  i thought  it was an earthquake  sure i did  and then i found myself hangin  upside  down  with all the blood runnin  into my head  what s it mean  young  fellers  i give yuh my word i don t get the hang o  it at all      max was not surprised to hear the man speak in this fashion  he had  already made up his mind  after that one good look at the other s face   the prisoner of the barrel trap was a pretty  slick article   as steve  would have expressed it  and caught in the act  as he had been  it was  to be expected that the fellow would have some kind of reasonable story  to spin  in order to explain his presence there     all the same  max did not give the yarn the least credence  something  told him the other was deliberately lying  and the fluency with which he  delivered that remarkable story announced the self named jake storms an  accomplished fakir  if ever there was one     so max  while not wishing to deliberately tell the man to his face that  he was a prevaricator  set about catching him in a little trap  the  others had also heard the explanation given  and were listening  with  puzzled looks on their faces  at least bandy legs and steve and toby  were  but obed was shaking his head energetically  as though he put no  faith in fairy tales  especially when coming from such unworthy lips      you said you were all alone  didn t you   demanded max      why  yes   course i was   spluttered the other  uneasily eying the  speaker  who was holding his light so that it shone directly on jake s  still flushed face      then what did you shout so loud for  if you didn t expect any one to  come to your assistance   continued max      oh  say  yuh see   course i knowed thar was  somebody  around  i d just  discovered signs of a camp  and sniffed smoke  but before i had half a  chance to make out what it meant  why something grabbed me by the leg   and threw me up like i was agoin  over the treetops  who wouldn t a  yelled  tell me  i own up i was rattled like everything  anybody would  be  wouldn t they  i couldn t understand it all  and right now i m still  agropin  in the dark  what struck me  and why does ye set such traps in  the trail over on this side o  mount tom  ain t the woods free for  anybody to walk in  what have i ever done to any o  yuh to be treated  like this  and have my head nigh jerked from my body  tell me that   sonny      max did not answer his question  while the explanation might seem to be  fairly plausible  he felt positive the man was telling a downright lie   and max believed he knew an easy way to prove it      watch him  obed  steve   he said to those who were alongside      never fear about that  max   snapped out steve   i ve got him covered  with my gun  and if he tries any slick game his name will be dennis   and not jake  hear that  mr  fur thief  do you  well  mind how you  tempt me to let fly with a charge of birdshot  i ve got a quick temper   and a quicker finger in the bargain  so settle back where you are      the man muttered between his set teeth  he was evidently feeling far  from comfortable  because something told him these wideawake lads would  not be so easily hoodwinked as he had fancied     he was watching the movements of max hastings  who had dropped to his  hands and knees  and seemed to be holding his little lantern so that the  light would show him the nature of the ground  truth to tell  max and  obed  when last at the trap  had taken the pains to smooth the ground  over  thus obliterating all previous footprints  this was done from a  double object  it would conceal the fact that work had been carried on  in that particular spot  in case sharp eyes were on the alert  and also  gave a clear field for observation  as was happening just then     max quickly found what he was looking for      come here  obed   he remarked  quietly  and as the other eagerly bent  over  max went on to say   you can see that here s another footprint   and quite different from the one made by his heavier boots  so he  did   have at least one companion along  perhaps two  for all we know  and  that stamps his story a yarn made out of whole cloth  he came here  just  as you expected  to rob you of your foxes  killing them wouldn t have  filled the bill so well  unless they made off with the pelts in the  bargain  how about it  obed       every word you say is true  max   breathed the other  indignantly      then we ll certainly not let him go free  that s a dead sure  proposition   ventured max  decidedly  and in a voice that he meant  should reach the prisoner      glad to hear you settle it that way  boys   remarked steve  who had  kept one eye on the prisoner and the other in the direction of his  mates   shall i march him over to the cabin right away      max gave a look around  he wondered where that other man could be just  then  and whether he was watching them from some neighboring covert   having by degrees recovered from the near panic into which he had been  thrown at the time his companion was snatched away from his side so  mysteriously  amidst a tremendous din  caused by the shouts of the  seized man  and the rattling of the stones inside the rolling barrel     but he could see nothing  the little lantern only covered a certain  amount of space with its meagre illumination  and much that was evil  might lurk beyond the radius of its lighted circle      yes  we ll change our base  and go back to the cabin   max said aloud    keep the guns ready for business  and if an attack is made shoot  straight      of course this admonition was delivered in a loud tone  mostly to warn  the unseen party  who might be hovering near  but both gun bearers gave  evidence of meaning to profit by the advice         chapter xii      the taps on the cabin wall    once more they were inside the cabin  obed was looking at the man again  as though he believed the other was possessed of certain information  which he hoped to obtain in turn  max  too  was observing all these  things with considerable interest  if the smile that appeared on his  face from time to time signified anything  but he was studying obed even  more than he seemed to pay attention to the man they had found turned  upside down in the tree      well  one of your clever traps worked like a charm  obed   steve was  saying  and doubtless meaning to compliment the fur farmer   but now  that they know we re on to their being around  it s hardly likely we ll  catch another victim tonight  all the same something ought to be done to  protect the fox pack       that s easily arranged   remarked max   we ll follow out the plan we  talked over  two had better stand guard at a time  and for several  hours  they can be relieved by another couple  and in this way the  balance of the night will be passed over  those on duty are to carry the  guns  and with orders to challenge any moving thing that comes along      the man had made no resistance when ordered to fall in line and  accompany his captors to the cabin under the pines  once inside  he had  glanced casually around  but max noticed that he did not seem greatly  interested  from this he guessed that perhaps the other may have seen  the interior of the lodge before  max remembered obed telling them that  some one had certainly been prowling about in his cabin at the time he  was away  though evidently frightened off by his return before having a  chance to do any damage      he isn t looking at these things  so strange to an ordinary cabin in  the woods  for the first time   was what max was telling himself  and  consequently his heart hardened toward the fellow     having previously arranged all about signals that could be given in case  of necessity  there was now little more to be said  of course steve had  to be counted on as one of the pair to be first placed on duty  he would  have been mortally offended had max failed to honor him with this  exhibition of trust  then bandy legs offered to share his vigil  and  steve eagerly accepted the proposal      take obed s gun  bandy legs   said max   and remember what i told you  about using it  shoot low  so as to fill their legs full of lead  if you  have to fire at all  and listen to our shouts as we join you  for we  don t want a warm reception from our friends  get that  both of you      steve and his fellow sentry admitted that they understood what their  directions were to be  then they went out  the man had been intently  watching all these things as though deeply interested  since max had  found the second series of footprints  and thus proved the falsity of  his claim of being alone  jake storms  so called woods guide and trapper  of fur bearing animals  had relapsed into a sullen silence     of course he knew that the game for him was up  so far as attempting to  deceive these wide awake boys was concerned  max wondered what thoughts  were teeming through the brain of the man  as he sat there on the bench  before the fire and listened to what passed between his captors  as for  obed  he cast many eager looks in the direction of the big fellow  and  from the expression on his face max believed he must be slowly making up  his mind toward some move     therefore he was not much surprised to finally see the woods boy sit  down alongside the man  who turned an inquiring face toward him  there  was also a tightening of the muscles around his mouth  just as though he  suspected he was about to be put to a severe test  and would have to  gather his wits in order not to make a false move      look here  jake storms  as you say your name is   commenced obed  once  more either forgetting to speak in his usual woods dialect  or not  thinking it worth while to bother with it any longer   i want to make  you a proposition  do you understand what a nice pickle you ve got  yourself into by prowling around my fur farm  and evidently trying to  steal my silver black foxes  if we take you down to the nearest  adirondack town it means you ll likely enough  be sent up as a thief   how would you like that  tell me       huh  guess jake storms  got a reputation that d kerry him through  all  right  sonny   muttered the big man  but max could see that he squirmed  uneasily  likewise obed must have guessed the truth also  as his next  remarks proved      a reputation may be one way or the other  jake storms  if that is  really your name  which i doubt very much  perhaps some people might be  glad to see you again  for one i don t believe for a single minute that  you re a trapper  or that you ever worked for paul smith  who knows the  kind of men he has around his hotel too well to hire a thief  i m as  sure as i draw breath that you came here to steal my blacks  yes  and  that you were  hired  to do this by another party  what was the sum of  money he promised you  jake  if you were successful  and is he around  here with you      the man made no reply  though various expressive changes took place in  the looks on his face  so obed  after waiting several minutes to hear  what the other might choose to say  went on      i said before that if we take you down to lathrop you ll be locked up   and when court is in session placed on trial  charged with attempted  robbery  your picture will be taken  and sent broadcast to every city   so if you re wanted for anything big  the authorities will know just  where to find you  that may not be pleasant for you to hear  jake  but  it s what i mean to have done  there s only one way you can escape it   do you want to hear what that way is       yuh re away off the track  young feller   blurted the man  obstinately  shaking his head in a contrary way   i ain t done nawthin  to make me  askeered o  the law officers  jake storms is my name  all right  too   and i m meanin  to trap over on the cranberry creek section  and i m on  my way down to lathrop right now to meet a mr  jasper  who ll vouch for  my character  sure he will  but go ahead  and say what yuh meant to   boy  it won t do me any harm to hear it  i reckons       this is the chance you ll have to get scot free  and the only chance    said obed solemnly   tell me who hired you to rob my fur farm  and not  leave a single black in the burrows  and i ll let you go free  will you  take my offer  or risk a prison sentence  jake      the man hesitated  that alone was enough to convince max that he was  guilty  for undoubtedly he must be weighing in the balance obed s offer   with the possibility of making his escape through the assistance of  companions      ain t got nawthin  to say  boy   he finally growled  as though making  up his mind  obed started up  and hastening over to a desk at one end  of the room he hurriedly searched through a drawer until he found what  he was looking for  after which he again sat down beside the man with  the tied hands     it was a photograph which he held up before the prisoner  and max could  see it was a man s face on the card      look at that  jake storms  and tell me  did  he  put it into your head  to come up here and clean my enclosures out  so as to rob me of the work  of nearly two years      the man started when he allowed his eyes to fall upon the face on the  card  but recovering his nerve instantly  he laughed harshly and  hurriedly snapped      i tell yuh  it s on the wrong track yuh are  boy   why  i never set  eyes on such a person as that thar  he s a utter stranger to me  and i  don t know him from adam  and i want to warn yuh that i ll turn around  and have the law on yuh for playin  such a low down trick on an honest  man  just passin  along through the woods  and never thinkin  no harm to  a single soul  i demands that yuh turn me loose to go my way  the woods  are free as the air to everybody  that s the law  further than that i  ain t got nawthin  to say     obed was plainly chagrined  as max could see  he evidently hoped to  obtain some valuable information from this man  but it seemed jake still  clung to the hope that he might obtain his freedom without betraying  secrets     max  taking advantage of obed s absent mindedness for a minute or so   managed to lean slightly forward and obtain a good look at the  photograph  it was that of a young man  perhaps thirty years of age  max  was struck with the fact that the photograph certainly bore some little  resemblance to obed himself  and one could easily believe they must be  related in some way  which  according to obed s former recital of his  widely flung family  would make the other a grimes also     the woods boy looked at the man several times  as though wondering  whether it would pay to make any further offer as an inducement to the  other to betray the confidence of his employer  but either obed did not  have the ready cash to offer a bribe  or else he deemed it not worth  while  after the fellow had shown such a stubborn disposition  for  presently he gave a sigh  and went back to return the photograph to the  little desk  once doubtless mr  coombs  property     toby was nodding before the fire  and really paying very little  attention to what was going on  in fact  he meant to crawl into his bunk  shortly  so as to get a little more sleep before being called upon to  take his turn outside as sentry  toby not having had his suspicions  concerning obed aroused at any time  failed to take the same interest in  the matter that steve  for instance  would have done  had he been  present      i hope yuh don t mean to make me set here on this bench all night with  my hands tied behind me so cruel like   remarked the man presently   applying his words directly toward max  as though he  too  had long ago  discovered how that energetic young chap seemed to be the  boss of the  ranch       why  no  we don t mean to be at all cruel   returned the other   here s  an extra blanket you can have  i ll lay it out for you on the floor  and  you can drop down just when you please  but don t expect that we re  meaning to unfasten your wrists  jake  we know a thing or two  and we re  expecting to take you down to lathrop tomorrow  to land you behind the  bars  you ve had your chance to squeal and get off scot free  i doubt if  another comes your way      he did just as he said  spreading the blanket so the man could manage to  roll over  and cover himself with its folds  this jake presently  accomplished  max also noticed how he lay with his feet against the  outer wall of the lodge and wondered at it  though without any clear  idea that this had any positive significance  but time was to tell     toby had crept into his  cell   which was what bandy legs had dubbed the  several bunks  built in the walls of the lodge so as to conserve room   and not be in the way during the daytime  max  on his part  did not mean  to follow suit  he thought it would hardly pay to try and snatch an  hour s restless sleep when so much was going on around them  and  then   besides  he did not trust the prisoner wholly  believing it would be  just as well to keep an eye on him     outside  all seemed as usual  it was long after midnight now  and if one  listened carefully he could catch the customary noises of the woods at  such a time  from the soft crooning of the breeze as it sighed through  the pine tops  to the occasional note of some night bird calling to its  mate  or the plaintive voice of a hungry young coon waiting impatiently  the return of its foraging mother     obed had thrown himself down on the cot  but max knew he did not expect  to lose himself in slumber  several times he saw the woods boy raise his  head and look in the direction of the sprawling figure of the man under  the spare blanket  obed was undoubtedly thinking still of ways whereby  he might force a confession from the lips of the stubborn man   apparently he seemed to be intensely interested in discovering whether  there was a power behind this raid on his enterprise  max  remembering  some things he had heard  began to believe he could see light in the  darkness now  and from the way in which he chuckled to himself every  little while  it might be judged that his thoughts were agreeable  on  the whole     surely a whole hour and more must have passed since steve and bandy legs  started out to assume their duty as guards over the fox farm  thus far  nothing had been heard from the videttes  who were undoubtedly carrying  out their orders to the best of their ability     max suddenly became aware that certain low sounds came to his ears  at  first he thought some branch of a tree must be tapping the low eaves of  the cabin being stirred to and fro by the breeze  as he listened  further  however  it struck max that there was a strange continuity  about the sounds  they seemed to come in little fragments  with a brief  hush between     the boy was instantly reminded of certain experiences he himself had had  in using a telegraph key while sending a message over the wires or  listening to the sounder rattle off one from some distant point  rude  and uncouth though the dots and dashes were  max quickly found that he  could make out a positive word  and it was the significant one of   free      gently he managed to turn his head in the direction of the spot where  the man had lain down  he still seemed to be sprawled there under the  blanket  a movement caught the eye of max  and he saw obed holding up a  finger at him in mute warning  thrilled by a sense of impending tragedy   perhaps  max watched the woods boy slowly but constantly making toward  him  obed moved with the noiseless nature of a black snake creeping over  the ground  his footfalls were so light that even a trained ear could  not have detected them  he kept on toward max until soon he had managed  to reach the other s side     still those plain taps continued to sound in regular rotation  first  coming from the outside  and then closer  max believed the man on the  floor was making use of his shoe to send a message calling for help  and  that some unknown party outside was giving him words of hope     but obed had now gained his side  and meant to whisper something in his  ear  so max prepared to pay full attention  at the same time he glanced  toward the door apprehensively  and was pleased to discover that  just  as he believed had been the case  the bar was in position  so that entry  could not be made by any enemy from without         chapter xiii      obed learns something     there s something brooding   obed whispered the first thing  and then  continued by saying   what are those queer little taps  max  i m sure he  has something to do with them       he s tapping the toe of his boot against the wall to send a message    explained the other   they are using the telegraphic code  i read the  one word  free   so  you see  there s some one outside the cabin  and  they re hatching up a scheme to get him loose      obed grew very much excited  he looked toward the door as though  inclined to immediately issue forth and investigate  max thought the  hope of capturing another prisoner was the lure that tempted him on      but what could have happened to steve and bandy legs   whispered the  woods boy  as though suddenly remembering the pair supposed to be  standing guard out there      nothing has happened to them  depend on it   replied max   but this  fellow must have been slippery enough to get by them  and reach the  cabin  that s all       oh  don t you think we might manage it  some way or other   begged  obed     vague though his question may have been  max had no difficulty whatever  in understanding what he meant  his own thoughts were already ranging in  the same quarter  and he could supply all the missing words  obed was  hoping that by suddenly issuing forth they might take the creeper by  surprise  and effect his capture  such a possibility apparently gave the  woods boy considerable pleasure even in the anticipation     max glanced again towards the door  they could creep noiselessly over in  that direction while the man on the floor and his friend without  continued their singular exchange of signals  remove the bar from its  place  and opening the door dash out to take the stooping fellow by  surprise     but then three would be better than two in such an adventure  there was  toby jucklin  a stout fellow  and usually well primed for anything that  smacked of excitement and peril  he must be awakened  and enlisted in  the game     so max held up a warning finger  and stooping low again whispered      i ll get toby  wait by the door for us  don t dream of going out until  we join you      with that he silently slipped over to the opening in the wall occupied  by the sleeping toby jucklin  the latter was easily aroused  and when  max whispered a word of caution in his ear  he knew enough not to cry  out  though of course the blood must have started bounding like mad  through his arteries     indeed  it was a most singular thing to be aroused from sound sleep by  being told that danger hovered over their heads  and that it would be  necessary for the three of them to sally forth so as to surprise the  enemy at work     toby was game  however  his vocal cords might play tricks with him  frequently  and give him heaps of trouble  but when it was a matter of  action  toby  took nobody s dust   as he often boasted     obed had meanwhile managed to creep over to the door  where he  impatiently awaited the coming of the other two  the strange tapping  sounds continued  and evidently the man lying there under the blanket  had become so deeply interested in what he was trying to communicate or  receive  that  so far  he had failed to discover there was any movement  in the cabin     of course  all of the boys were quivering with half suppressed  excitement  though grimly determined to put their plan into operation   obed had already reached up and taken hold of the bar  so as to be ready  to remove it when joined by his companions      keep the bar   whispered max   it will make a fine club  obed       say when  max   came back from the tightly compressed lips of the woods  boy  whose eyes could be seen glittering eagerly in the firelight      open up   max told him     perhaps the door may have made some creaking sound on being drawn back   either that  or else the man chanced to free his head from the muffling  folds of the blanket just then  and discovered what was going on  he  gave a shout of warning  and the three boys shot through the opening at  the same instant     max led the way  he had carefully noted the location of the sounds  and  judged that the interloper must be somewhere close to the wall where  jake storms lay  so it was in that direction he leaped     the stars wore shining brightly above  besides this a certain amount of  light managed to come through that small window of the lodge  and help  to partially dispel the gloom without      there he is   cried obed  as they turned the corner  and discovered a  figure in the act of scrambling erect     pell mell the trio rushed at the unknown who just managed to gain a  footing when he found himself furiously beset  there was a tremendous  struggle  the man seemed savage at the thought of being caught  and  struck furious blows  toby at one time managed to cling to the other s  back for a brief moment  but was dislodged by a clever fling that sent  him crashing against a tree  and made him grunt like a hog that receives  a jolt     one thing certain  max could easily see that the party they were  attacking must be something of an athlete  from the way in which he  fought  it is not easy to resist the assault of three enemies at once   since they may attack from as many directions  and confuse his defense   still the way this man struck out  dodged  tore himself free from their  clinging hands  and conducted himself in general surprised max very much  indeed     this kept up for almost two full minutes  with varying fortunes   sometimes it appeared as though they were getting the upper hand of the  unknown  and then by a furious effort he would break free again  only to  be once more clutched     in the midst of the fracas  loud shouts close at hand told that steve  and bandy legs  having heard the row  were rushing hurriedly to the  spot  astonished beyond measure at the racket     the man must have heard their cries  and the fact that his enemies were  about to receive reinforcements seemed to give him the strength of  desperation  for he suddenly tore himself free from max  leaving his  coat in the hands of the boy      oh  he s gone   gasped obed  almost entirely out of breath because of  his recent tremendous exertions     for a fact  the man had vanished almost as though the ground had opened  and swallowed him up  even astute max hardly knew which way to look for  him  then came the other pair rushing up  and demanding to know what all  the row was about     as soon as he could recover his breath  max tried to explain  he had to  repeat it twice  however  before bandy legs could grasp the astounding  fact that some one had actually been carrying on a telegraphic  conversation with their prisoner  tapping on the wall of the cabin to  spell out the words      say  you re stringing us  i expect  boys   exploded the doubter   it  sounds just like a fairy story to me  but then there  was  some one  here  because we glimpsed him disappearing like a falling star  i wanted  to give him a shot  but i remembered what max here said about shooting  when in doubt  and we didn t just know but what it might be one of you       but  max  he got away after all   continued the disappointed obed  as  though to his mind that event overshadowed all others   and i did want  to find out if it was any one i knew  i believe it was  on my soul  for  at college he always had the reputation of being an all round athlete       huh   grunted toby  rubbing his head ruefully as he came up  and  limping in the bargain   t t that was him  all r r right then  obed  i  don t know the f f fellow s n n name  but i ve g g got his trade mark on  my c c cheek  every k k knuckle of his fist  huh  he s an athlete  every  time       but don t tell me our prisoner skipped out   cried steve  in sore  dismay      not that we know of  unless he s gone since we dashed from the cabin    max informed him   and as we can t accomplish anything standing here   suppose we adjourn to the inside again  toby will want a little  soothing salve on his bruises  and i ve got a sore hand myself  where i  struck him harder than i meant to on the back of his head       it s too bad  too bad   mourned obed  following the others toward the  open door   such a splendid chance may not come again  and i d like to  know  i certainly would      when they entered the cabin  the first thing all of them did was to look  eagerly to see if the man still lay there  upon finding that he had not  tried to escape during all the excitement  possibly being afraid he be  fired on  they felt relieved      anyhow  we ve still got him safe and sound   declared steve   exultantly      and he may make up his mind to tell yet   remarked obed  picking up  fresh hope   when he finds that i mean all i said  and that he s on the  road to prison      the man glowered at them  though apparently he seemed fairly well  pleased to find that they had not succeeded in capturing his ally  max  awaited developments  he was satisfied with the way things were going   and deep down in his heart believed the thrilling announcement he was  storing up with which to startle his three chums would not now be long  delayed      i s pose we ought to go out again  and resume our watch   suggested  steve  after a short time had elapsed   it s too soon for a change  and  after all that excitement none of us feel a bit sleepy       as for me   ventured bandy legs   i m that wide awake i feel as if i  never could go to sleep again while we re up here in the mountains   where such queer things keep on happening right along       s s say  i m s s sorry for obed   ventured toby  who it seems had heard  the lament of the woods boy  and could sympathize with him   he had  h h hoped to g g get a pointer by g g grabbing that streak of  g g greased lightning  but after all  the fellow was too much for the  whole b b bunch of us       but it s made me feel pretty sure now   said obed brightening up  perceptibly   that i know who s to blame for all this trouble  i had a  hint about it before  you remember i told you  boys  and while he kept  his face hidden pretty much all the time he fought  i surely heard him  say something that struck me as familiar  he wasn t a stranger  i m  certain of that       well   said max  quietly   perhaps there may be a way to prove that       please tell me how  max   pleaded obed  eagerly      the mysterious stranger managed to get away   chuckled the other   but  he wasn t so clever about taking all his wardrobe along with him  you  remember       oh  his coat   cried obed  in thrilling accents      i hung on to that like a leech   now laughed max   of course i should  have been smart enough to keep my fingers on the man inside  but he had  a slick way of just slipping out of the coat  first thing i knew he was  gone  leaving me holding the bag  as they say  want to take a look at  that article  don t you  obed  sometimes men have a fashion of keeping  letters and documents in their coat pockets  and between us i believe  you ll find something like that here      with these words  the speaker took up the coat he had torn from the back  of the unknown  and tossed it carelessly toward obed     the woods boy snatched at the garment eagerly  newly aroused hope could  be seen upon his face  everybody watched to see what the outcome might  turn out to be  steve and bandy legs  ready to withdraw from the circle   and resume their outside vigil  stayed their departure for a brief  period in order to satisfy their curiosity  even the so called jake  storms had his fishy eyes fixed on obed  as though it mattered something  to him whether the latter learned the answer to the conundrum  or was  obliged to let it pass by unsolved     so obed upon receiving the coat  proceeded to ram an eager hand into the  pockets  one after another  when he reached an inside one  he found a  bonanza  just as max had anticipated  there were some papers there  as  well as a bill book  bending down nearer the fire  so that he might the  better see  obed glued his eyes on his find  a few seconds passed  the  fire crackled as it began to eat into the fresh fuel that had been  tossed to the red embers upon the incoming of the party  toby grunted  once or twice  and continued to ruefully rub the side of his head  his  right arm  one of his thighs  and  in fact  as much of his entire person  as he could conveniently cover in a short space of time     then obed was heard to give a low exclamation  his whole manner was a  singular mixture of satisfaction and anger  evidently  he had  accomplished his set purpose  and the result had aroused conflicting  emotions within his breast      well  have you found out who the man is  obed   asked steve  unable to  curb his burning curiosity      yes  there s no longer any question about it   returned the other   bitterly   for here are letters addressed to him  i may even take the  privilege of reading them tomorrow  for in that way i can perhaps  discover some evidence that will force him to stop this ugly business   oh  the meanness of robert to strike this cowardly blow at me  his own  cousin  he s a disgrace to the whole family       pity the poor grimeses   exclaimed max  looking straight at obed  with  such a queer expression on his face that presently the woods boy could  not keep from bursting into a laugh      max  you re on to me  i can see   he cried  rushing up to the other and  holding out his hand eagerly   i ve guessed for some time that you had  your suspicions  and now i know it s so      and max  too  threw back his head to indulge in a good laugh  while  steve  toby and bandy legs  with months agape  and eyes that were as  round as saucers  simply gathered around  and stared at the two who were  shaking hands      hey  what s all this about  i want to know   spluttered steve  just as  though he meant to say that no one had any business to have secrets from  the rest   looky here  obed  since when did you forget that grimes woods  lingo you ve been giving us right along  i m beginning to smell a rat   that s what i am          chapter xiv      a big surprise    evidently  steve was commencing to get on the scent of the explanation  of the mystery  but as for toby and bandy legs  they found themselves up  against a blank wall  for aught they could see     instead of trying to explain  obed turned to max  saying meekly      you tell them  please  wax  it s only your due  after solving the  puzzle as nearly as you have  i saw you turn back to that book again   and scan my initials in the front  that was why you asked me if mr   coombs  first name had been robert  when it was not  but it s all right   and i m satisfied i had my peek of fun out of it  let me tell you  now  introduce me to your chums  max       with the greatest of pleasure   laughed the other  as he took hold of  obed  and waving in a ceremonious fashion with the other hand  he  continued   friends  toby and bandy legs  allow me to present some one  to you whom you ll be delighted to know   this is roland chase       bandy legs stood as if riveted to the spot  staring  and holding his  very breath through astonishment  toby jucklin wanted to express his  amazement  and also his ecstatic delight  over the wonderful outcome of  their mission  but alack and alas  as so often happened with toby   while the spirit was willing the flesh was lamentably weak  and he could  not make a sound except a sort of spluttering gasp  while his eyes  blinked  and his face grew rosy red     still laughing  the so called grimes  boy proceeded to grip hands with  his guests  he acted as though it might be a simon pure introduction  as  it certainly was  in one sense      i m ashamed of the way i bamboozled you fine fellows  and that s the  honest truth   he started to say  but on the impulse of the moment i  thought of that obed grimes name  and once i gave it to you i had to  follow up with the lingo  i guess i got balled up more than once  for  max soon discovered that i didn t always speak as a true grimes should   and that gave him his clue  yes  i m the same roland you started out to  find  just to please my dear old aunt  bless her heart  i was planning  to surprise them all by appearing in town with my five thousand dollars   after i d sold the fox cubs  and then claiming my share of uncle s  estate  i guess it s all getting plain enough to you now  eh  fellows     bandy legs could speak at last      why  it s as plain as the nose on my face  obed  i beg pardon  roland   and i can never forgive myself for being so easily taken in and done  for  so you thought to invest your two thousand dollars in starting a  silver black fox farm  did you  well  it was a daring venture  and i  hardly think you would have made the game if you hadn t been lucky  enough to meet up with that splendid mr  coombs       that s a certainty  bandy legs   admitted the other  who apparently was  not at all given to boasting over his achievements   yes  i was in great  luck to be able to do mr  coombs a favor  and win him for a friend  see  what he s done for me  but all the same  i invested my money in this  business  and according to our partnership agreement  i am to have  one half the proceeds of any sales  so there can be no slip of the law   to beat me out of my inheritance  if only i can get those precious pups  to the man who s engaged them       and this rascal you called robert  is he the elder cousin who would  profit by your failure to win out   asked max  although he already  understood that this must be true      the expressive face of their new friend clouded immediately      i m sorry to say that it s so  max   he admitted   those envelopes of  the letters i found in his coat gave it away  the temptation was too  great for robert  who always showed considerable jealousy  because our  uncle rather favored me  and so when he learned in some fashion  i m  sure i don t know how  that i was in a fair way of carrying out the  provisions of uncle s will  he must have determined to try and spoil my  plans       oh  the cur   snapped the indignant steve  now seeing the depravity of  the miserable plotter in full   i m glad that some of you managed to  give him a few good licks before he broke away  and i ll regret it to  the last day of my life that i didn t get a chance to show him       and b b believe me   exclaimed toby  with a violent effort   he s going  to carry the scratches i g g gave him on his f f face for a w w while   if i d known that he was roland s c c cousin i d have dug a h h heap  d d deeper  too       i m only hoping   roland  as we must call him after this  since he  dropped the grimes family when he admitted his identity  said   this  will teach him a lesson  and that he ll leave me alone from now on  but  robert is a terribly persistent fellow  and i m afraid his failure may  only spur him on to trying again       never mind  roland   said steve  dwelling almost affectionately on the  name  now that he knew the one who claimed it   we re going to stand  back of you through thick and thin  if those fox pups don t eventually  get to their prospective purchaser  we ll have to know the reason why   isn t that so  fellows       my sentiments exactly   said max  promptly      me  too   exclaimed toby      ditto here   added bandy legs      i want to say this   observed roland with a suspicious moisture in his  fine eyes   it was the luckiest hour of my life when i ran across this  bunch of royal good fellows  why  only for you i d as like as not have  been  ruined   because alone and single handed i never could have stood  out against two clever and unscrupulous schemers  and i ll never forget  it as long as i draw breath       there ll be some people mighty sorry  though  i bet you   bandy legs  hastened to add  as he looked roguishly at roland   by which i mean  those poor grimeses  who have lost tonight the brightest star in the  whole big grimes constellation  why  i can just picture how they ll all  mourn  uncle hiram  uncle silas  uncle nicodemus  and all those other  uncles and aunts  with old granddaddy grimes weeping harder than any of  the rest over the bereavement  for obed is no longer in the flesh      the comical way in which bandy legs said this caused a general laugh   why  even the wondering prisoner on the floor  who  of course  could  hardly understand the joke  had to grin at the humorous expression on  the boy s face      oh  i guess they ll be able to stand it  if i can   ventured roland    please don t bear me any malice  fellows  for having my little joke   you see i used to be quite a hand for such things  but living all alone  up here didn t give me much of an opportunity to try any pranks  and so  i was just aching for a turn  it didn t do any harm  and afforded me  some fun  so please forget it       but  roland  none of that story you told us about your good friend  mr   coombs  was made up  of course   asked steve      that was every word of it true   came the quick answer   oh  he was  the finest old gentleman you ever heard about  i grew very fond of him   and when i received word in a letter from his housekeeper that he had  died  shortly after his wife went  it broke me all up  i moped around  here for a whole week  and came near throwing the entire job up  then i  remembered how he had always put such confidence in everything i  attempted  and so i just shut my teeth tighter together  and said i d go  through with it or know the reason why  and i have  for i m on the point  of success  if only that robert doesn t upset the fat in the fire at the  last hour       well  he won t  you can just depend on that   said bandy legs  almost  fiercely   here are four standbys who are booked to gather around  and  see that you get the fox pups to market  next time robert comes where he  isn t wanted  he may get a broken head  or something just as bad  for  now we know his ugly game  we re not apt to be over particular how hard  we hit      all of which must have been very comforting to the boy who had taken  such a big load upon his young shoulders  in the effort to show what he  was made of  after all  perhaps the eccentric uncle who left such a  strange provision in his will knew human nature better than most people  do  for he had picked out the very thing calculated to spur a chap like  roland to do his best      well   remarked max   since we ve cast off the numerous grimes tribe   and discovered the one we were in search of  and as the hour is getting  fearfully late  suppose we postpone further talk until morning  there  remain a few hours to be utilized in sleep  steve  you and bandy legs  haven t filled out your time as sentries yet  suppose you hold for  another hour  and then turn it over to me       just as you say  max   replied the other   i meant to propose that  anyway  for the alarm broke out in the middle of our watch  secretly   i d like mr  robert to take his courage in both fists and sneak back  this way  bent on further mischief  do you ask me why  well  i d delight  to make use of my scatter gun  and let him have a mess of number ten  shot at  say sixty yards  they d pepper him good and plenty at that  distance  without actually endangering his miserable life      max  knowing the energetic nature of the speaker  warned him against  being too prompt at using his gun      better go slow about that  steve   he remarked   many a fellow has been  shot by mistake  every season dozens fall victims to hunters who see  something moving  and blaze away recklessly  it might be one of us  for  all you d know  so don t think of firing without giving our signal      steve solemnly promised to remember  he knew the danger of handling  firearms in a reckless fashion  and was not likely to offend  so  presently  with bandy legs in tow  he went forth to resume their  interrupted vigil     max and roland sat there by the resurrected fire for a short time  exchanging remarks  the prisoner lay on the floor and  as far as they  could tell  seemed to have given up all hope of a rescue  for his heavy  breathing was that of one whom sleep had overtaken     finally  max pointed toward toby  who could be seen lying on his back in  his bunk  and evidently enjoying a fine time in dreamland      we d do well to imitate his example  roland   he remarked   and as a  last word i want to tell you again how delighted we all are over finding  you  not only that  but discovering that you ve been busy all these  months  your aunt is worrying her head off about you  the last words she  said were   if only you do find  the boy  and he s made a mess of his  attempt to win his inheritance  tell him aunt sarah has a place in her  heart for him  and that if only he ll come back he can be her boy for  keeps  because i find that i ve grown to love him as my own       roland appeared to be deeply affected when he heard this  for he winked  violently a good many times  and then  smiling  managed to say      you don t know how happy you make me when you tell that  max  for she s  a dear old soul  and i certainly do care for her a great deal  but it  pleases me also to know i ve made good  and that i can hold up my head  when i show those trustees what i ve done  the chase family needn t  blush just yet on account of roland  though it ought to for robert s  mean actions      so they  too  sought their beds  such as these were  and tried to forget  all else in sweet sleep     max had a peculiar habit  almost any boy can acquire it through much  practice  and sometimes it comes in very handy  he was able to impress  it upon his mind that he wanted to awaken at about a certain time  once  in a long while this might fail him  but nine times out of ten he could  hit it in a most surprising manner  many persons have proved this  perfectly feasible  and although max began it as an experiment of the  control of mind over matter  it had long since passed that stage  and  become a regular habit with him     accordingly  in just an hour after steve and bandy legs had gone forth  again  max was out of his bunk  and arousing toby  who got up rather  loth to abandon his good bed and pleasant dreams  still  he made no  complaint  unless his frequent yawns could be counted as such  but  trotted at the heels of max when the other started forth     the night remained calm  high overhead the gentle breeze still sighed  among the pines  and whispered secrets as it passed through the fragrant  green needles with their attendant cones     max took a single glance aloft at the star studded heavens  and this  told him pretty close on the hour  for in addition to many other ways of  the forest nomad and believer in woodcraft  max had mastered the  positions of the planets  so that it was always possible for him to  gauge the passage of time when the night granted him a survey of the  constellations above     when he and bandy legs had advanced a certain distance max stopped and  imitated the call of a screech owl  so like the whinny of a horse  it  ended up with a peculiar twist  and it was this that would tell any of  the other fellows the sound was intended for a signal  and did not  proceed from the real bird itself     an answer quickly came  then a couple of dim forms hove in sight  being  steve and his fellow vidette  ready to hand over the guns to their  successors  and seek the shelter of the cabin for a little rest      listen  max   said steve  while this exchange was taking place    there s something queer out yonder aways  and i want you to try and  make out what it can mean       how is that   demanded the other      why  every little while we thought we could hear a distant strange cry  like somebody in pain  of course it might come from a night bird that we  don t happen to be acquainted with  but it s been worrying us a heap   i m afraid  though  the wind has shifted latterly  because we didn t  seem to catch it so well      max hardly knew what to think of what steve had told him  nevertheless   he promised the other he and toby would listen for all they were worth   and see if they might have any better success in recognizing the strange  sounds     but the minutes drifted along  and at no time were they able to catch  anything out of the common  so  finally  they decided that either it  must have been a night bird that had flown away  or else that change in  the wind had kept the sounds from coming to their ears         chapter xv      steve s dream comes true     did you hear anything  max      that was the very first thing steve asked on the following morning  when  he poked his head out of his  hole in the wall  like a shrewd old  tortoise looking around to learn if the coast were clear      we listened from time to time   explained max   but were never sure  that we heard any strange sound  it seems that you must have been  impressed with it considerably  steve  to have it on your mind so       i was  max  and i am right now   admitted the other  frankly   listen  to me  while the rest are busy getting breakfast ready over at the  fire    and his voice sank to a confidential whisper   i had a dream  it  wasn t so queer that it should come to me  after all that s happened  i  dreamed that we came on that bad cousin of roland s  robert chase  he d  fallen over a precipice  and was dying there on the rocks  oh  it was  horribly real  max  and i woke up shivering  he was sorry  too  because  he had been so wicked  and was asking roland to please forgive him  and   max  i ve been wondering whether that dream mightn t have come to me to  let us know we might do a good deed if we walked out that way this  morning  you and me  saying nothing to the rest of the boys      max was struck by the thought that steve must have had a pretty vivid  dream to make him so tender hearted  at the same time  he felt in accord  with the sentiments so aptly expressed by the other      steve  i ll go you there   he hastened to say   it can do no harm  and  may be a fine thing  are you sure you know the direction fairly well       yes  because i was sharp enough to make a note of it last night  max   you see  at the time the wind was coming in a lazy sort of way right out  of the west  later on it swung around to the northwest  which makes it  so sharp this morning       good for you  steve   the other told him   then we ll head direct into  the west  and cover the ground for  say a mile  coming back over another  route  we can call out now and then  so if any one heard us they might  answer  but you d better hurry and get your duds on  because  unless i m  mistaken  bandy legs is meaning to sing out that breakfast s ready  and  you know the last to the feast is penalized when the supply runs short       no danger of that happening when bandy legs has anything to do with the  cooking   chuckled steve  confidently  which remark proved how well  those four chums knew one another s weak points     of course at breakfast most of the conversation had to do with roland  and his valiant attempt to  make good   he told his new friends many  things that interested them exceedingly  and which were connected with  his struggle  their questions also brought them quite a fund of  information concerning the habits of foxes  and how those who aim to  raise the valuable animals for the great london fur market  go about the  business      as for me   said bandy legs  who had been doing considerable thinking  while all this talk went on   i mean to try and hunt up a few of those  bouncer frogs roland here says inhabit his marsh  of course i know that  at this time of year they re deep down in the mud  and meaning to lie  there till spring thaws  em out  but it may be i can scare up just a  mess  i m awfully fond of frogs  legs  you may remember  boys      they all wished him luck  steve advised him to borrow a spade from the  owner of the woods cabin  for he might have to dig deep  bandy legs   however  only grinned and showed no signs of a change of mind  for once  he set his heart on a thing and he was apt to keep everlastingly at it  until the realization  that it was quite hopeless  would compel him to  throw up the sponge  which bandy legs always did with a bad grace     so breakfast was finally finished  and the boys separated  true to his  promise the would be frog hunter set out valiantly on his errand  urged  by his love for a dainty dish  toby had agreed to assist roland look  after his fox brood  for there were many things he did not yet  understand concerning their care  and which he earnestly wished to know     this arrangement quite suited steve and max  for it left them free to  saunter forth  they announced their intention of taking a little look  around  steve  of course  picked up his gun before starting  saying      you never know when you may want a shooting iron up in the woods  there  might be an old wildcat prowling around these diggings  which would take  a dislike to the shape of my face  so he d attack us  and i m homely  enough as it is right now  without inviting a cat to make the map of  ireland over my phiz      he and max showed no signs of being in any unusual hurry as they left  the cabin  they started directly toward the west  and once out of sight  of those left behind  steve quickened his pace a bit  at least he   chirked up  and began to show more animation      a mile  you said  max  didn t you   he asked      why  yes  that ought to fully cover the distance   came the reply   i  shouldn t think you could have caught any ordinary sound even as far as  that  still  when the night is calm  it is wonderful how far even a  groan will carry  the atmosphere seems to be in a peculiar condition at  such times  and acts as a splendid medium for conveying sounds      they looked to the right and to the left as they advanced  nothing  escaped the eyes of those two chums  accustomed to the  great outdoors   as they were  and having long ago graduated in a knowledge of woodcraft     some little time passed thus  they had so far seen and heard nothing  calculated to impress them  though steve was just as sure the sounds he  caught on the preceding night must have been a human voice crying out in  anguish  doubtless that vivid dream was also making quite an impression  on the mind of the boy  for max found him unusually docile and  thoughtful     they had now gone considerably over half a mile  max felt that if any  discovery was going to be made  it must come very soon  he raised his  voice occasionally  and gave a half shout  after which both of them  would stand still and strain their hearing in hopes of catching some  answering hail     squirrels barked at the intruders of their nut domain  blue jays  screamed harshly as they flitted from limb to limb among adjacent trees   crows sent forth many noisy caws from atop of some neighboring pine   watching those moving figures suspiciously the while  and once a deer  suddenly leaped across the trail  with a flip of its short tail  to  speedily vanish amidst the colored foliage of some bushes     this last event caused steve to give a real yell  he was so startled   hardly had he done this than he gripped the sleeve of his comrade      did you hear that  max  was it an echo to my whoop  or did somebody  really call out in a weak voice  anyway  it seemed to come from right  over there   and he pointed confidently as he spoke     max himself was of the same opinion  for he felt almost certain that a  human voice had tried to attract their attention  though possibly the  person giving utterance to the cry was so weak that he could not make  much effort     they changed their course a little  and headed directly toward the  region whence steve had pointed so positively  when max held the other  up presently and called again  all doubt was removed      here  this way  i m in pretty bad shape  i guess  don t leave me   please  whoever you are  i ll pay you a hundred dollars to get me out of  this scrape      evidently  the speaker  whom max decided must be robert chase  and no  other  supposed the persons approaching  and whose voices he had heard   must be woods guides who might consider themselves fortunate indeed to  earn such a royal sum so easily     two minutes afterwards and the boys found him  he must have fallen into  the hole while hurrying through the forest  after breaking away from the  grip of the boys at the cabin  he had been severely cut by a sharp  flint like rock  and lost considerable blood  which weakened him so  that  as he afterwards confessed to them  he must have swooned away   and lain there for hours unaware of his perilous condition     the two boys soon managed to get the young man up on level ground  as  often happened  it was max who conceived the easiest way of doing this   to lift a dead weight of a hundred and fifty pounds is no light task   and so he started to break away one side of the pit  thus raising the  bottom of the interior until they were able to simply  carry  robert out  of the hole     steve was loud in his expressions of admiration      whoever else would have thought up such a clever piece of business   max  but you   he went on to say  as they rested after their effort    why  if it d been me in charge now  i reckon i d have gone to all sorts  of trouble rigging up some sort of block and tackle  so as to hoist him  up  but you just knock down a part of the wall  and there you are  as  neat as wax  wherever did you learn that trick  i want to know  max       you ll laugh if i tell you   chuckled the other   one day in reading  about how some musty old professors are digging out all sorts of weighty  treasures belonging to bygone days over in  egypt  i chanced to learn  how a certain arab contracted to excavate a big stone weighing ever so  many tons  and which the learned savant could not see how they were ever  going to get out of the deep hole  well  that arab just kept filling up  the hole  and lifting the stone inch by inch  when he finished there  was no hole  but the great rock stood on level ground  and that  steve   they say is old time mechanical engineering  which has never been beaten  in these modern days  the pyramids were built in that simple way  human  lives and labor counted for little in those old times       all i can say is  max  it takes you to apply whatever you read to  working out your own problems  but however are we going to get this man  back to the cabin  must we build a litter and carry him      robert seemed to be suffering from something more than physical anguish   a tortured mind can stab even more keenly than painful bodily wounds   lying there and facing possible death  robert chase had evidently seen a  great light  he beckoned to the boys to bend over him  and then in a  weak voice went on to say      i don t know just how badly i m hurt  young fellows  but i do know that  i m done with this miserable business  i ve got just what i deserve  and  it may be the best thing that ever happened to me  during the time i lay  here and had my senses  i ve made up my mind to ask my cousin roland to  forgive me  and let me make amends for the evil i ve tried to do  i know  now that it doesn t pay in the long run  for i ve come near losing all  my self respect  yes  get me to the camp  if you can  i want to face the  music  and have it over with  something seems to tell me that the boy  isn t the one to hold a grudge against a chap who s been punished  already for doing an evil deed      that sort of talk pleased max immensely  he saw that robert chase must  have been having a terrible conflict between his better nature and the  insatiate craving for wealth  and now that a wise providence had stepped  in to nip all his plots in the bud  why things began to look very bright  all around     it was found that with one of the boys on either side  robert could  manage to walk fairly well  although they often had to stop and let him  rest     it took them a full two hours to get back to the cabin  where their  arrival created considerable excitement  at the moment  roland was out  somewhere attending to his pets  and so the injured man was made as  comfortable as possible by toby and bandy legs  the latter of whom had  just come in carrying a pretty fair mess of frogs  legs all dressed for  the frying pan     then when roland came along  to be told what had happened  and how his  cousin was anxious to see him alone  he looked actually pleased at the  queer turn affairs had taken  he went in and was with robert for quite a  long time  they must have had a good heart to heart talk  for when  roland appeared again  he was smiling broadly  and hastened to say      we ve not only patched up a truce  boys  but made an enduring covenant   after this there s not going to be any war in the chase family  and now  that robert has humbled himself to confess his wrong doing  i believe  we re going to be the best of friends  i ve promised him  without his  asking it  that i ll never tell a single soul about what happened up  here  you must agree to the same thing  for my sake  i feel sure you ll  all like robert  when you get to know him       who can tell   muttered toby  as if to himself   in time we might even  g g get  familiar  with him  stranger things than that have happened  i  only hope he won t hold a g g grudge against me when he sees the mark of  all my f f fingernails down his face       just now  toby  he isn t in a mood to bear anybody a grudge   roland  went on to say   for he believes he didn t get half that he merited  but  after all it s come out a thousand per cent better than i ever dreamed  it would  and when i start off with my pair of grown cubs i needn t be  afraid of any one waylaying me on the road       all the same   observed steve  raising his heavy eyebrows suggestively    we ll see to it that you have plenty of company on the way  since the  object of our trip up here into the heart of the adirondacks has been  fulfilled  i rather reckon we ll be wanting to go along with you  to see  the fox pups handed over  and that lovely check received  afterwards we  can all start for carson  where you and your good old aunt may have a  family reunion all to yourselves  unless you see fit to invite uncle  sephus  uncle nicodemus  uncle job  or some of those old worthies to  join with you  so as to make things hum      they all laughed at steve s humorous remark      b b but what s to be d d done with this p p pretty thing   demanded  toby  pointing as he spoke to their prisoner  who was sitting outside  the door  having one of his ankles held fast with a trailing rope  so  that he could not run away  even if tempted to do so  which  considering  his helpless condition  with both hands tied behind his back  he was  hardly in the humor to do         chapter xvi      the fur farmer s triumph  conclusion    while all this talk was going on  the man had of course listened  what  he had just heard roland say about forgiving his scheming cousin must  have encouraged the fellow more or less  for surely if they meant to let  the chief conspirator go scot free  it would hardly be fitting to take  it out on the poor hired tool      i hope you include me in that general amnesty order  young fellows   he  now hastened to say  with a wishful look on his face   since the fat is  in the fire i m ready to tell anything you want of me  course my name  isn t jake storms  though it isn t necessary for me to inform you what  it might be  because that doesn t concern anybody around here  i needed  money pretty badly  and the gent tempted me beyond my limit  so i agreed  to help him steal the fox cubs  i was to have all they d fetch when  sold  and so i came along  but if you just cut these cords  and tell me  to clear out  i ll vamose the ranch instanter      max nodded his head in the affirmative      you might as well make an early start   he remarked  drily   since  things have turned out the way they have  we couldn t make any use of  you  but before you go  understand one thing  my friend       what might that be  young fellow   asked the other  though looking very  much pleased at hearing he would be set free      don t get it into your head that it s going to be an easy snap to come  back here and rob this fox farm  you d be a fool to try it for many  reasons  in the first place  silver blacks are so few in number that any  one selling a cub or a pelt can be tracked  and made to prove ownership   there s also an association forming that will insure these costly  animals  and chase a thief across the continent until they eventually  get him  just as the bankers  association does  understand that       oh  don t bother about me   the man hastened to tell them   i m through  with this sort of risky game  i can make a living at something that  brings in easier returns  only set me free and i ll never come back here  again  never  on your life       there ll be a guard here while we re gone   continued max  sternly   a  man who can hit a silver quarter with his rifle as far as he can see it  through the telescopic globe sight  it wouldn t be safe for prowlers to  show up here  besides  they could never find the foxes  hidden deep down  in their burrows  during the night time  steve  set him free  please      the boys felt that they could afford to be magnanimous  since things had  taken such a glorious turn in their favor  so they not only gave the  so called jake storms his liberty but filled his pockets with such food  as would serve him until he came to a town  roland was seen talking with  him just before he left  and max felt sure the boy must have thrust some  money into the man s hand  for the fellow acted as though greatly  confused  and shook his head while walking hastily away  as though the  kindness of those boys quite overwhelmed  him     roland continued his work of making his cousin thoroughly ashamed of his  recent mean actions  he waited on the injured man as though robert had  always been one of his best friends  if ever a fellow  heaped coals of  fire on the head of his enemy   roland chase certainly did during the  three days they continued to linger at the lodge under the pines     meanwhile  the signal had been set for jerry stocks to come over  and  when he arrived  he turned out to be very much the kind of a man the  boys expected to see  a homely specimen of a woodsman  honest as the day  was long  and  filled to the brim   as steve aptly expressed it  with an  accurate knowledge of all such things as may prove of value to one who  roams the wilderness     he was to be left in charge during the absence of the young fur farmer   roland had long ago won the sincere admiration of the rugged woodsman   who stood ready to do anything to show his regard  besides  he would be  well paid for all his trouble  and his family might even come over to  visit him occasionally     during the balance of their stay under the sheltering roof of the  wonderful little lodge under the whispering pines  the boys made use of  every hour in order to enjoy their limited holiday  since success had  crowned their efforts to find the missing one  they were in constant  high spirits  it always produces a feeling of exultation to know that  the goal has been attained for which a start was made  and the four  chums were only human     they certainly had a great time of it  visiting all sorts of strange  nooks under the guidance of either roland or jerry  max found a number  of opportunities to add to his interesting collection of flashlight  pictures  he made a specialty of the fox farm  and with the assistance  of the young owner  managed to snap off the timid occupants of the  enclosures in the act of feeding  as well as under various other equally  instructive conditions  all of which would give a pretty good idea of  how progressive fur farmers manage their outfit     the wounded man grew better  so that when it was time for them to leave   he could take his part in the procession  though the others declined to  let him burden himself with any of the duffle  since he was still weak     max had been studying robert  and reached the conclusion that the young  man was heartily ashamed of his miserable plotting  he hoped it would  be a good lesson calculated to serve robert the rest of his life  and if  this turned out to be so  then that stumble of his  unfortunate as it  may have seemed to him at the time  was the best thing that had ever  happened to him     the two marketable fox pups were placed securely in the cage that had  been secured for this very purpose by roland when last in the city  it  weighed very little  and could be easily transported like an ordinary  pack on the back  roland himself meant to carry it  but of course the  others insisted on  spelling  him from time to time     really  when the fateful morning hour came  and they turned back to give  a last fond look at the little lodge under the green pines  max and his  three chums were conscious of a strange feeling of keen regret around  the region of their hearts  which proved how the woods home of roland  had grown upon them      i certainly do hope those pictures will turn out to be daisies  max    steve was heard to say  most earnestly   because i ll take a heap of  satisfaction in recalling many of the pleasant things that have happened  to us up here  where the breeze is always telling tales to the pinetops   and it s nice to be able to see what your mind is centered on       but look here   said roland  delighted to hear steve talk in that  strain   you mustn t think that even if i do succeed to that jolly  little fortune left by my real uncle  and not one of the grimeses  that  i m meaning to drop this fox farm business  by now it s got a deep hold  on me  and i m more bent than ever on making it a big success  yes  and  i m also counting on you fellows paying me another visit some other  time  the sooner the better      they assured him it would please them beyond measure to contemplate  spending part of their next summer vacation with him  when they could  investigate still further the many delightful mysteries of the  adirondack wilderness     so the lovely nook was lost sight of  and for some little time a silence  seemed to fall upon all the members of the group  as they continued to  trudge along the trail that eventually would fetch them to a road  and  after that to a village     of course our story nears its end  now that we have seen max and his  chums accomplish the object of their search  they meant to continue  along in the company of roland  and see that the pair of beautiful  glossy silver black fox pups were safely delivered to the purchaser  who  intended to start a fur farm of his own in some other part of the  country  possibly away up in the canadian northwest  and had taken a  great fancy for the particular strain of animal roland was propagating     in due time they arrived at the city where this rich gentleman lived  he  had  it appeared  seen and admired the fox pups while fishing in the  neighborhood of the fur farm  and made a contract with roland for the  delivery of the pair at a certain time  binding the bargain with a cash  payment     it all turned out as planned  and when the boy received the balance of  the stipulated amount in a handsome check he felt that he had a right to  feel proud of his accomplishment     robert had long before then took his leave  and in doing so he squeezed  the hand of his younger cousin  and assuring roland that he meant to see  more of him in the future  so far as max could observe  the man appeared  to have turned over a new leaf  and from that time forward was likely to  show what was really in him besides his former desire to loaf and spend  money     and so in the fullness of time  the five boys turned up in carson  where  a certain good woman whom roland claimed as his aunt was wonderfully  well pleased to find his arms about her wrinkled neck  and his boyish  kiss pressed upon her cheek  she assured roland the first thing  that  there was no need of his worrying about the future  because she had  determined to make him her heir  regardless of whether he ever came into  the money left under such exacting conditions by his deceased uncle     naturally  roland was proud to tell his aunt that while he appreciated  her fresh interest in his career  and would be only too glad to respond  to her affection  at the same time she must know he had not made a  failure  and that even now he was about to call upon the trustees of  the will  to show them he had faithfully carried out all the provisions  upon the fulfillment of which his legacy depended     it all came out as planned  indeed  those same old trustees of the  estate  living in another town  had the greatest surprise of their lives  when that troop of boys called upon them  and the whole story was told   for of course max and the other trio eagerly snapped at roland s warm  invitation to accompany him on this momentous occasion  so as to witness  his crowning triumph  and add their testimony  if needed  as witnesses  to the successful outcome of his plans     roland had taken pains to gather all necessary documents showing how he  invested the greater part of his two thousand dollars  and how he was to  draw half the proceeds on any sales  he also had the contract for the  delivery of the first of the silver black fox pups  and after could  in  addition  show the fat check covering that particular sale     everything had been looked after to a fraction  the old men found it  difficult to believe what at first to their minds seemed so like a fairy  story  but in the end they had to admit that roland chase had fully  complied with every one of the conditions imposed on him in the strange  will of his uncle  and as the time limit had not yet expired  he was  fully entitled to his legacy  which in due time was paid over to him     after that  roland again departed for the wonderful  farm   where the  most valuable crop ever heard of was being grown successfully  the other  lads heard from him frequently during the winter months  and there was  no discouraging report forthcoming  he now had jerry with him constantly  as his assistant  the guide having built a cabin near the farm  where he  installed his family  it was nicer for roland  too  since there were  several children  and he could spend many an evening sociably  having  taken up a phonograph with him  together with a fine supply of all sorts  of records suitable for amusing a mixed company     max often allowed his thoughts to bridge the many miles that separated  carson from that lodge in the wilderness  and it required no magician s  wand to enable him to see in his mind s eye the delightful surroundings  that made the strange fur farm a possible el dorado  where fortune was  liable to knock on the door and demand entrance     it is with more or less regret that the writer finds he has reached the  point where he must say goodbye  and he only does so with the  understanding that just as soon as further stirring events worth  narrating come to pass  it will be his pleasure  as well as duty  to  place them between the covers of another book in this series     the end           the oblong box                                                  some years ago  i engaged passage from charleston  s c   to the city of  new york  in the fine packet ship independence  captain hardy  we were  to sail on the fifteenth of the month  june   weather permitting  and   on the fourteenth  i went on board to arrange some matters in my  stateroom     i found that we were to have a great many passengers  including a more  than usual number of ladies  on the list were several of my  acquaintances  and among other names  i was rejoiced to see that of mr   cornelius wyatt  a young artist  for whom i entertained feelings of warm  friendship  he had been with me a fellow student at c    university   where we were very much together  he had the ordinary temperament of  genius  and was a compound of misanthropy  sensibility  and enthusiasm   to these qualities he united the warmest and truest heart which ever  beat in a human bosom     i observed that his name was carded upon  three  staterooms  and  upon  again referring to the list of passengers  i found that he had engaged  passage for himself  wife  and two sisters  his own  the staterooms were  sufficiently roomy  and each had two berths  one above the other  these  berths  to be sure  were so exceedingly narrow as to be insufficient for  more than one person  still  i could not comprehend why there were   three  staterooms for these four persons  i was  just at this epoch  in  one of those moody frames of mind which make a man abnormally  inquisitive about trifles  and i confess  with shame  that i busied  myself in a variety of ill bred and preposterous conjectures about this  matter of the supernumerary stateroom  it was no business of mine  to be  sure  but with none the less pertinacity did i occupy myself in attempts  to resolve the enigma  at last  i had not arrived at it before   it is  a servant  of course   i said   what a fool i am  not sooner to have  thought of so obvious a solution   and then i again repaired to the  list  but here i saw distinctly that  no  servant was to come with the  party  although  in fact  it had been the original design to bring  one  for the words  and servant  had been first written and then  overscored   oh  extra baggage to be sure   i now said to  myself   something he wishes not to be put in the hold  something to be  kept under his own eye  ah  i have it  a painting or so  and this is  what he has been bargaining about with ficolino  the italian jew   this  idea satisfied me  and i dismissed my curiosity for the nonce     wyatt s two sisters i knew very well  and most amiable and clever girls  they were  his wife he had newly married  and i had never yet seen her   he had often talked about her in my presence  however  and in his usual  style of enthusiasm  he described her as of surpassing beauty  wit  and  accomplishment  i was  therefore  quite anxious to make her  acquaintance     on the day in which i visited the ship  the fourteenth   wyatt and a  party were also to visit it  so the captain informed me  and i waited on  board an hour longer than i had designed  in hope of being presented to  the bride  but then an apology came   mr  w  was a little indisposed   and would decline coming on board until to morrow  at the hour of  sailing      the morrow having arrived  i was going from my hotel to the wharf  when  captain hardy met me and said that  owing circumstances   a stupid but  convenient phrase    he rather thought the independence would not sail  for a day or two  and that when all was ready  he would send up and let  me know   this i thought strange  for there was a stiff southerly  breeze  but as  the circumstances  were not forthcoming  although i  pumped for them with much perseverance  i had nothing to do but to  return home and digest my impatience at leisure     i did not receive the expected message from the captain for nearly a  week  it came at length  however  and i immediately went on board  the  ship was crowded with passengers  and everything was in the bustle  attendant upon making sail  wyatt s party arrived in about ten minutes  after myself  there were the two sisters  the bride  and the artist  the  latter in one of his customary fits of moody misanthropy  i was too  well used to these  however  to pay them any special attention  he did  not even introduce me to his wife  this courtesy devolving  per force   upon his sister marian  a very sweet and intelligent girl  who  in a few  hurried words  made us acquainted     mrs  wyatt had been closely veiled  and when she raised her veil  in  acknowledging my bow  i confess that i was very profoundly astonished  i  should have been much more so  however  had not long experience advised  me not to trust  with too implicit a reliance  the enthusiastic  descriptions of my friend  the artist  when indulging in comments upon  the loveliness of woman  when beauty was the theme  i well knew with  what facility he soared into the regions of the purely ideal     the truth is  i could not help regarding mrs  wyatt as a decidedly  plain looking woman  if not positively ugly  she was not  i think  very  far from it  she was dressed  however  in exquisite taste  and then i  had no doubt that she had captivated my friend s heart by the more  enduring graces of the intellect and soul  she said very few words  and  passed at once into her stateroom with mr  w     my old inquisitiveness now returned  there was  no  servant   that  was  a settled point  i looked  therefore  for the extra baggage  after some  delay  a cart arrived at the wharf  with an oblong pine box  which was  everything that seemed to be expected  immediately upon its arrival we  made sail  and in a short time were safely over the bar and standing out  to sea     the box in question was  as i say  oblong  it was about six feet in  length by two and a half in breadth  i observed it attentively  and like  to be precise  now this shape was  peculiar   and no sooner had i seen  it  than i took credit to myself for the accuracy of my guessing  i had  reached the conclusion  it will be remembered  that the extra baggage of  my friend  the artist  would prove to be pictures  or at least a  picture  for i knew he had been for several weeks in conference with  nicolino  and now here was a box which  from its shape   could  possibly  contain nothing in the world but a copy of leonardo s  last supper   and  a copy of this very  last supper   done by rubini the younger at  florence  i had known  for some time  to be in the possession of  nicolino  this point  therefore  i considered as sufficiently settled  i  chuckled excessively when i thought of my acumen  it was the first time  i ever known wyatt to keep from me any of his artistical secrets  but  here he evidently intended to steal a march upon me  and smuggle a fine  picture to new york  under my very nose  expecting me to know nothing of  the matter  i resolved to quiz him  well   now and hereafter     one thing  however  annoyed me not a little  the box did  not  go into  the extra stateroom  it was deposited in wyatt s own  and there  too  it  remained  occupying nearly the whole of the floor  no doubt to the  exceeding discomfort of the artist and his wife   this the more  especially as the tar or paint with which it was lettered in sprawling  capitals  emitted a strong  disagreeable  and  to  my  fancy  a  peculiarly disgusting odor  on the lid were painted the words    mrs   adelaide curtis  albany  new york  charge of cornelius wyatt  esq  this  side up  to be handled with care       now  i was aware that mrs  adelaide curtis  of albany  was the artist s  wife s mother  but then i looked upon the whole address as a  mystification  intended especially for myself  i made up my mind  of  course  that the box and contents would never get farther north than the  studio of my misanthropic friend  in chambers street  new york     for the first three or four days we had fine weather  although the wind  was dead ahead  having chopped round to the northward  immediately upon  our losing sight of the coast  the passengers were  consequently  in  high spirits  and disposed to be social  i  must  except  however  wyatt  and his sisters  who behaved stiffly  and  i could not help thinking   uncourteously to the rest of the party   wyatt s  conduct i did not so  much regard  he was gloomy  even beyond his usual habit  in fact he was   morose   but in him i was prepared for eccentricity  for the sisters   however  i could make no excuse  they secluded themselves in their  staterooms during the greater part of the passage  and absolutely  refused  although i repeatedly urged them  to hold communication with  any person on board     mrs  wyatt herself was far more agreeable  that is to say  she was   chatty   and to be chatty is no slight recommendation at sea  she  became  excessively  intimate with most of the ladies  and  to my  profound astonishment  evinced no equivocal disposition to coquet with  the men  she amused us all very much  i say   amused    and scarcely  know how to explain myself  the truth is  i soon found that mrs  w  was  far oftener laughed  at  than  with   the gentlemen said little about  her  but the ladies  in a little while  pronounced her a  good hearted  thing  rather indifferent looking  totally uneducated  and decidedly  vulgar   the great wonder was  how wyatt had been entrapped into such a  match  wealth was the general solution  but this i knew to be no  solution at all  for wyatt had told me that she neither brought him a  dollar nor had any expectations from any source whatever   he had  married   he said   for love  and for love only  and his bride was far  more than worthy of his love   when i thought of these expressions  on  the part of my friend  i confess that i felt indescribably puzzled   could it be possible that he was taking leave of his senses  what else  could i think   he   so refined  so intellectual  so fastidious  with so  exquisite a perception of the faulty  and so keen an appreciation of the  beautiful  to be sure  the lady seemed especially fond of   him   particularly so in his absence  when  she made herself ridiculous  by frequent quotations of what had been said by her  beloved husband   mr  wyatt   the word  husband  seemed forever  to use one of her own  delicate expressions  forever  on the tip of her tongue   in the  meantime  it was observed by all on board  that he avoided  her  in the  most pointed manner  and  for the most part  shut himself up alone in  his state room  where  in fact  he might have been said to live  altogether  leaving his wife at full liberty to amuse herself as she  thought best  in the public society of the main cabin     my conclusion  from what i saw and heard  was  that the artist  by some  unaccountable freak of fate  or perhaps in some fit of enthusiastic and  fanciful passion  had been induced to unite himself with a person  altogether beneath him  and that the natural result  entire and speedy  disgust  had ensued  i pitied him from the bottom of my heart  but could  not  for that reason  quite forgive his incommunicativeness in the  matter of the  last supper   for this i resolved to have my revenge     one day he came upon deck  and  taking his arm as had been my wont  i  sauntered with him backward and forward  his gloom  however  which i  considered quite natural under the circumstances   seemed entirely  unabated  he said little  and that moodily  and with evident effort  i  ventured a jest or two  and he made a sickening attempt at a smile  poor  fellow  as i thought of  his wife   i wondered that he could have heart  to put on even the semblance of mirth  at last i ventured a home thrust   i determined to commence a series of covert insinuations  or innuendoes   about the oblong box  just to let him perceive  gradually that i was   not  altogether the butt  or victim  of his little bit of pleasant  mystification  my first observation was by way of opening a masked  battery  i said something about the  peculiar shape of  that  box   and   as i spoke the words  i smiled knowingly  winked  and touched him gently  with my fore finger in the ribs     the manner in which wyatt received this harmless pleasantry convinced  me  at once  that he was mad  at first he stared at me as if he found it  impossible to comprehend the witticism of my remark  but as its point  seemed slowly to make its way into his brain  his eyes  in the same  proportion  seemed protruding from their sockets  then he grew very  red  then hideously pale  then  as if highly amused with what i had  insinuated  he began a loud and boisterous laugh  which  to my  astonishment  he kept up  with gradually increasing vigor  for ten  minutes or more  in conclusion he fell flat and heavily upon the deck   when i ran to uplift him  to all appearance he was  dead      i called assistance  and  with much difficulty  we brought him to  himself  upon reviving he spoke incoherently for some time  at length we  bled him and put him to bed  the next morning he was quite recovered  so  far as regarded his mere bodily health  of his mind i say nothing  of  course  i avoided him during the rest of the passage  by advice of the  captain  who seemed to coincide with me altogether in my views of his  insanity  but cautioned me to say nothing on this head to any person on  board     several circumstances occurred immediately after this fit of wyatt s  which contributed to heighten the curiosity with which i was already  possessed  among other things  this  i had been nervous  drank too much  strong green tea  and slept ill at night  in fact  for two nights i  could not be properly said to sleep at all  now  my stateroom opened  into the main cabin  or dining room  as did those of all the single men  on board  wyatt s three rooms were in the after cabin  which was  separated from the main one by a slight sliding door  never locked even  at night  as we were almost constantly on a wind  and the breeze was not  a little stiff  the ship heeled to leeward very considerably  and  whenever her starboard side was to leeward  the sliding door between the  cabins slid open  and so remained  nobody taking the trouble to get up  and shut it  but my berth was in such a position  that when my own  stateroom door was open  as well as the sliding door in question  and my  own door was  always  open on account of the heat   i could see into  the after cabin quite distinctly  and just at that portion of it  too   where were situated the staterooms of mr  wyatt  well  during two nights    not  consecutive  while i lay awake  i clearly saw mrs  w   about  eleven o clock each night  steal cautiously from the stateroom of mr   w   and enter the extra room  where she remained until daybreak  when  she was called by her husband and went back  that they were virtually  separated was clear  they had separate apartments  no doubt in  contemplation of a more permanent divorce  and here  after all  i  thought  was the mystery of the extra stateroom     there was another circumstance  too  which interested me much  during  the two wakeful nights in question  and immediately after the  disappearance of mrs  wyatt into the extra stateroom  i was attracted by  certain singular  cautious  subdued noises in that of her husband  after  listening to them for some time  with thoughtful attention  i at length  succeeded perfectly in translating their import  they were sounds  occasioned by the artist in prying open the oblong box  by means of a  chisel and mallet  the latter being muffled  or deadened  by some soft  woollen or cotton substance in which its head was enveloped     in this manner i fancied i could distinguish the precise moment when he  fairly disengaged the lid  also  that i could determine when he removed  it altogether  and when he deposited it upon the lower berth in his  room  this latter point i knew  for example  by certain slight taps  which the lid made in striking against the wooden edges of the berth  as  he endeavored to lay it down  very  gently  there being no room for it  on the floor  after this there was a dead stillness  and i heard nothing  more  upon either occasion  until nearly daybreak  unless  perhaps  i  may mention a low sobbing  or murmuring sound  so very much suppressed  as to be nearly inaudible  if  indeed  the whole of this latter noise  were not rather produced by my own imagination  i say it seemed to   resemble  sobbing or sighing  but  of course  it could not have been  either  i rather think it was a ringing in my own ears  mr  wyatt  no  doubt  according to custom  was merely giving the rein to one of his  hobbies  indulging in one of his fits of artistic enthusiasm  he had  opened his oblong box  in order to feast his eyes on the pictorial  treasure within  there was nothing in this  however  to make him  sob    i repeat therefore  that it must have been simply a freak of my own  fancy  distempered by good captain hardy s green tea  just before dawn   on each of the two nights of which i speak  i distinctly heard mr  wyatt  replace the lid upon the oblong box  and force the nails into their old  places  by means of the muffled mallet  having done this  he issued from  his stateroom  fully dressed  and proceeded to call mrs  w  from hers     we had been at sea seven days  and were now off cape hatteras  when  there came a tremendously heavy blow from the southwest  we were  in a  measure  prepared for it  however  as the weather had been holding out  threats for some time  everything was made snug  alow and aloft  and as  the wind steadily freshened  we lay to  at length  under spanker and  foretopsail  both double reefed     in this trim  we rode safely enough for forty eight hours  the ship  proving herself an excellent sea boat  in many respects  and shipping no  water of any consequence  at the end of this period  however  the gale  had freshened into a hurricane  and our after sail split into ribbons   bringing us so much in the trough of the water that we shipped several  prodigious seas  one immediately after the other  by this accident we  lost three men overboard with the caboose  and nearly the whole of the  larboard bulwarks  scarcely had we recovered our senses  before the  foretopsail went into shreds when we got up a storm stay sail  and with  this did pretty well for some hours  the ship heading the sea much more  steadily than before     the gale still held on  however  and we saw no signs of its abating  the  rigging was found to be ill fitted  and greatly strained  and on the  third day of the blow  about five in the afternoon  our mizzen mast  in  a heavy lurch to windward  went by the board  for an hour or more  we  tried in vain to get rid of it  on account of the prodigious rolling of  the ship  and  before we had succeeded  the carpenter came aft and  announced four feet water in the hold  to add to our dilemma  we found  the pumps choked and nearly useless     all was now confusion and despair  but an effort was made to lighten the  ship by throwing overboard as much of her cargo as could be reached  and  by cutting away the two masts that remained  this we at last  accomplished  but we were still unable to do anything at the pumps  and   in the meantime  the leak gained on us very fast     at sundown  the gale had sensibly diminished  in and  as the sea went  down with it  we still entertained faint hopes of saving ourselves in  the boats  at eight p m  the clouds broke away to windward  and we had  the advantage of a full moon  a piece of good fortune which served  wonderfully to cheer our drooping spirits     after incredible labor we succeeded  at length  in getting the long boat  over the side without material accident  and into this we crowded the  whole of the crew and most of the passengers  this party made off  immediately  and  after undergoing much suffering  finally arrived  in  safety  at ocracoke inlet  on the third day after the wreck     fourteen passengers  with the captain  remained on board  resolving to  trust their fortunes to the jolly boat at the stern   we lowered it  without difficulty  although it was only by a miracle that we prevented  it from swamping as it touched the water  it contained  when afloat  the  captain and his wife  mr  wyatt and party  a mexican officer  wife  four  children  and myself  with a negro valet      we had no room  of course  for anything except a few positively  necessary instruments  some provision  and the clothes upon our backs   no one had thought of even attempting to save anything more  what must  have been the astonishment of all then  when  having proceeded a few  fathoms from the ship  mr  wyatt stood up in the stern sheets  and  coolly demanded of captain hardy that the boat should be put back for  the purpose of taking in his oblong box      sit down  mr  wyatt   replied the captain  somewhat sternly   you will  capsize us if you do not sit quite still  our gunwale is almost in the  water now       the box   vociferated mr  wyatt  still standing   the box  i say   captain hardy  you cannot  you  will  not refuse me  its weight will be  but a trifle  it is nothing  mere nothing  by the mother who bore  you  for the love of heaven  by your hope of salvation  i  implore  you  to put back for the box      the captain  for a moment  seemed touched by the earnest appeal of the  artist  but he regained his stern composure  and merely said      mr  wyatt you are  mad   i cannot listen to you  sitdown  i say  or you  will swamp the boat  stay  hold him  seize him  he is about to spring  overboard  there  i knew it  he is over      as the captain said this  mr  wyatt  in fact  sprang from the boat   and  as we were yet in the lee of the wreck  succeeded  by almost  superhuman exertion  in getting hold of a rope which hung from the  fore chains  in another moment he was on board  and rushing frantically  down into the cabin     in the meantime  we had been swept astern of the ship  and being quite  out of her lee  were at the mercy of the tremendous sea which was still  running  we made a determined effort to put back  but our little boat  was like a feather in the breath of the tempest  we saw at a glance that  the doom of the unfortunate artist was sealed     as our distance from the wreck rapidly increased  the madman  for as  such only could we regard him  was seen to emerge from the  companion way  up which  by dint of a strength that appeared gigantic   he dragged  bodily  the oblong box  while we gazed in the extremity of  astonishment  he passed  rapidly  several turns of a three inch rope   first around the box and then around his body  in another instant both  body and box ware in the sea  disappearing suddenly  at once and  forever     we lingered awhile sadly upon our oars  with our eyes riveted upon the  spot  at length we pulled away  the silence remained unbroken for an  hour  finally  i hazarded a remark      did you observe  captain  how suddenly they sank  was not that an  exceedingly singular thing  i confess that i entertained some feeble  hope of his final deliverance  when i saw him lash himself to the box   and commit himself to the sea       they sank as a matter of course   replied the captain   and that like a  shot  they will soon rise again  however   but not till the salt  melts        the salt   i ejaculated      hush   said the captain  pointing to the wife and sisters of the  deceased   we must talk of these things at some more appropriate time                                                  we suffered much  and made a narrow escape  but fortune befriended  us    as well as our mates in the long boat  we landed  in fine  more dead  than alive  after four days of intense distress  upon the beach opposite  roanoke island  we remained there a week  were not ill treated by the  wreckers  and at length obtained a passage to new york     about a month after the loss of the independence  i happened to meet  captain hardy in broadway  our conversation turned  naturally  upon the  disaster  and especially upon the sad fate of poor wyatt  i thus learned  the following particulars     the artist had engaged passage for himself  wife  two sisters  and a  servant  his wife was  indeed  as she had been represented  a most  lovely and most accomplished woman  on the morning of the fourteenth of  june  the day in which i first visited the ship   the lady suddenly  sickened and died  the young husband was frantic with grief  but  circumstances imperatively forbade the deferring his voyage to new york   it was necessary to take to her mother the corpse of his adored wife   and on the other hand  the universal prejudice which would prevent his  doing so openly  was well known  nine tenths of the passengers would  have abandoned the ship rather than take passage with the dead body     in this dilemma  captain hardy arranged that the corpse  being first  partially embalmed  and packed  with a large quantity of salt  in a box  of suitable dimensions  should be conveyed on board as merchandise   nothing was to be said of the lady s decease  and  as it was well  understood that mr  wyatt had engaged passage for his wife  it became

herregaardshaver       illustration  fig     stauderabat foran mur i en engelsk have      det tyske ord staude har i mangel af et dansk i mangfoldige aar tjent  som kollektivbetegnelse for en vis klasse af haveplanter  der botanisk  set er uden systematisk samhorighed  men som danner et fysiologisk hele   en gruppe af haveplanter  der kan defineres som fleraarige  urteagtige   haardfore prydplanter  trods denne tilsyneladende skarpe begraensning  gaar stauderne dog jaevnt over i tilstodende dele af planteverdenen   fleraarigheden kan for manges vedkommende under visse forudsaetninger  blive til toaarighed  og paa den anden side kan toaarige planter under  visse fysiske forhold eller ved kulturens indgriben forblive fleraarige   enkelte stauder kan ogsaa af og til vise tendens i retning af traeagtig  udvikling af de nederste partier  og endelig er haardforheden jo et  svingende begreb  hvad der er haardfort paa taasinge  fryser vaek ved  viborg  og de enkelte aaringer og de enkelte planters forhold forrykker  stadig graensen for haardforheden     det bliver altsaa i mange tilfaelde en skonssag  om en plante kan  henregnes til stauderne eller ikke  blandt de her i bogen naevnte  planter  vilde mange maaske ikke anerkende digitalis purpurea   agapanthus umbellatus og yucca filamentosa som stauder  men kalder dem  henholdsvis en toaarig plante  en koldhusplante og en busk  naar  imidlertid en plante i sin kultur og sin hele anvendelse ikke adskiller  sig fra stauderne  saa kan man rolig benaevne dem som saadan  og det er  da heller ikke taget i betaenkning i denne bog  hvis hensigt blot er at  bidrage til en storre anvendelse af disse prydplanter navnlig i de  almindelige villahaver  denne sidste begraensning har medfort  at de  egentlige rabat og gruppestauder

o s v  og med  roserne  der jo i det vaesentlige udgor havens udsmykning med blomster   vil det  hvad prisen angaar  vise sig  at stauderne gerne vil falde lidt  dyrere ud end roser  naar det samme areal skal tilplantes  medens de  selvfolgelig i laengden vil vaere langt billigere end  udplantningsplanterne  der kun varer en sommer  hvad udgiften til  arbejdet med vedligeholdelsen angaar  vil et staudeareal i reglen koste  det meste arbejde  naar det da ikke drejer sig om en af de saakaldte  naturlige plantninger  der selvfolgelig slet ikke bor vedligeholdes i  almindelig gartnerisk forstand  medens enhver  der overhovedet vil  kan  passe rosenplantninger og almindelige blomsterbede  vil der i reglen  fordres en vis sum af kendskab baade ved tilplantningen og ved  vedligeholdelsen af staudeplantninger  men til gengaeld for denne storre  indsats af penge eller arbejde  ogsaa tankearbejde    giver stauderne  rigtignok ogsaa skonhed og glaede tilbage i et helt andet omfang og langt  mere mangfoldigt end andre blomster     det  folk soger hos blomster  og grundene  hvorfor de dyrker dem  kan  vaere saa ganske forskelligt  nogle mennesker glaeder sig navnlig over  blomsterbedenes rent dekorative virkning  medens andre staar i et ganske  anderledes intimt forhold til planterne og navnlig glaeder sig over de  enkelte individers skonhed og over det hele vegetariske liv  for disse  sidste er netop stauderne de planter  der mere end nogen andre giver  udtryk for dognets og aarstidernes vekslen  en stauderabat med mange  arter er i stadig udvikling  skifter udseende omtrent hver dag  med  naesten dramatisk kraft giver disse planter udtryk for livets kredslob   spiring  udvikling  blomstring  visnen og fald  medens et pelargoniebed  er ganske stillestaaende hele sommeren

menneskene end andre planter  der i disse sidste aar har  lettet stauderne deres sejrsgang  de er i allerhojeste grad den private  haves  hjemmets blomster  og det er da ogsaa saerlig england og  nordamerika  med disse landes hojt udviklede boligkultur  at stauderne  pranger i haverne  medens de i frankrig  hvor havekunsten vaesentlig  tager sigte paa det repraesentative og ikke paa det hjemlige  er naesten  ukendte udenfor liebhavernes kreds  i hvert fald i deres moderne  anvendelse  den endelose variation baade i farve og form og i det hele i  alle forhold giver stauderne den mest alsidige anvendelsesmulighed  og  ogsaa derigennem en aevne til at vaekke interesse  som  udplantningsplanterne aldrig kan naa      illustration  fig     stauderabat foran mur i en engelsk have      naar en plantegruppe  med saa overdaadige muligheder for at blive  populaer og anvendt i storre udstraekning  dog forst i de allersidste aar  er begyndt at indtage den plads i haverne  der tilkommer den  og det  skont stauderne egentlig aldrig har savnet talsmaend indenfor havebrugets  literatur  saa maa det naturligvis have sine ganske saerlige grunde  som  maa soges og paapeges  om ikke den pludselige skiften fra havens  skammekrog til dens haedersplads skal forekomme ganske uforklarlig  eller  kun udslag af en mode  disse aarsager  til at stauderne i de mange aar  har fristet en saa trist tilvaerelse  findes tre steder  nemlig hos  stauderne selv  i deres hidtidige mangelfulde behandling og endelig i  visse havearchitektoniske forhold     selve staudematerialet har i de sidste ti a femten aar gennemgaaet en  indgribende forbedring  ikke saa meget ved introduktion af nye  arter   denne kilde  der tidligere flod saa rigeligt  er nu  da hele  jordkloden efterhaanden er bleven bogstavelig trawlet for dekorative  planter  naesten ophort at rinde  kun fra vestkina er der i de senere aar  kommet en del gode stauder   men ved den gartneriske forbedring af aeldre  arter  ved krydsbefrugtninger har man skabt hundreder og atter hundreder  af nye former  og ved udsaed i titusindevis af samme plante har man  udsogt et enkelt individ  der udmaerkede sig i en bestemt retning

udbredte stauder er behaeftede med fejl  som  altfor kort blomstring  tilbojelighed til at vaelte  omfindtlighed for  frost og m m   som deres altfor beskedne skonhed slet ikke kan veje op   samtidig med at skonheden i og for sig er foroget  har man ligeledes ved  tiltraekning af nye former faaet borteliminere en del af den arts  praktiske mangler      footnote    i  jovzelle       illustration  kelway   son  langport  fig     paeoner i skyggen af aeldre  traeer      grunden til at stauderne hidtil i reglen har faaet en fejlagtig  behandling og anvendelse maa soges  foruden i den manglende interesse   der er forstaaelig ligeoverfor de mange kedelige sorter  der findes  udbredt overalt  tillige vistnok ogsaa i  at stauderne navnlig er blevet  anbefalede med  at de kunde passe sig selv  og ganske stille stod og  voksede sig konnere og konnere  saadanne doktriner er  naar de engang  har faaet indpas i amator havebruget  naesten uudryddelige  og dette er  saa meget mere beklageligt i foreliggende tilfaelde  som intet er mere  fejlagtigt end den naevnte indgroede anskuelse  stauderne kraever under  visse forhold ganske vist kun liden pasning  men i reglen dog mere end  f  eksempel roser  og selv om enkelte stauder helst skal lades urorte i  mange aar  saa vil det store flertal ikke som paastaaet vokse sig  konnere  men vil  overladte til sig selv  gaa jaevnt tilbage efter det  forste par aars forlob  i maengder af villahaver er det eneste  kulturarbejde  der foruden lugning ofres paa stauderne  en foraars eller  vintergravning mellem blokkene og dette arbejde er kun til skade  se  nedenfor under omtalen af rensning mellem stauderne   under disse  omstaendigheder bliver stauderne  saerlig naar de tillige er fejlagtigt  anvendte  kun kedelige og komme ufortjent i daarligt ry  en fejl ved  anvendelsen har vaeret  at man naesten altid plantede for faa sammen af  samme art  det er forst naar adskillige sammenplantes  at de tiltraekker  sig nogen opmaerksomhed  den fejl begaas naesten aldrig med  udplantningsplanter  der altid anvendes mange samlede  endelig har et  artsvalg afpasset efter de forhaandenvaerende jordbundsforhold vist  hidtil vaeret ret sjaeldent  og det er netop kun gennem et saadant  at der  opnaas den rigtige frodighed og glans i plantningen     den tredie art aarsager til den hidtidige ringe og fremtidige udstrakte  anvendelse af stauder  maa som naevnt soges i de havearchitektoniske  forhold     som man vil vide var forrige aarhundrede lige til halvfemserne behersket  af den saakaldte landskabelige havestil  det vil sige  at parker og  haver anlagdes og beplantedes med det naturlige landskab som forbillede   navnlig det typiske engelske landskab med bolgende graesflader   fritstaaende traeer og buskgrupper blev efterlignet  anvendelsen af de  rigtige prangende havestauder var i et paa den maade anlagt areal  principstridigt og kunde kun finde sted ved en fremtraedende  inkonsekvens  forst i slutningen af aarhundredet aendredes smagen som  bekendt i den retning  at haven  navnlig den mindre  blev anlagt som en  have og ikke som landskab  og derfor naturligvis blev beplantet med  haveplanter  denne nyere retning i havekunsten  har med iver kastet sig  over stauderne  som det allerbedste blomstermateriale  ikke alene paa  grund af skonheden i og for sig  men ogsaa fordi mange af stauderne  horer til vore aller aeldste haveplanter  og derfor har en vis gammeldags  og hjemlig hygge over sig  som netop passer i de nutidige bestraebelser  paa haven og husets omraade  der paa enhver maade soger tilknytning til  boligkulturen for et par generationer siden   vore oldrefaedres have og  hus      illustration  kelway   son  langport  fig     hvide lupiner i skygge      samtidig med at denne moderne  mere rationelle  i reglen retlinede maade  at anlaegge haver paa  har sejret og skaffet plads for stauderne  saa er  der  gloria victis  opstaaet en art  nylandskabelig  bevaegelse  der  naesten helt og holdent bygger paa staudeanvendelse  den aeldre have med  hele sit konventionelle landskabelige apparat  de lange perspektiver  de  kulisseagtigt opstillede buskadser og traegrupper  led  dens ovrige gode  eller daarlige sider ufortalte  i hvert fald af den mangel  at dens  anvendelse paa smaa haver kraevede en saa lille maalestok  at det hele  ofte blev ganske meningslost  i mere eller mindre bevidst folelse af  dette begyndte man for en del aar siden i england at skabe naturlige  landskabsbilleder mindre vegetations scenerier  der kunde fremstilles  uden at reducere maalestokken     denne den saakaldte  wild gardening  fik sin fortrinligste forkaemper i  den bekendte havebrugsforfatter w  robinson  og navnlig i de senere aar  i den ikke mindre bekendte haveaestehtiker miss gertrud jekyll  omkring  en dam  i en lysning  i et krat eller paa andre velegnede steder  hvor  synet af fremmedartede omgivelser ikke kan genere  skabte man vaesentligt  ved hjaelp af stauder  der ikke havde et altfor kultiveret praeg og som  ifolge deres vaekst egnede sig dertil  et stykke have  hvor alt groede  som var det hjemmehorende  og derfor fik det vildtvoksende

begyndelsen af dette aarhundrede  viste en lignende  bevaegelse sig i tyskland  men medens man i england ad forsogenes og  erfaringens vej naaede til at fastslaa maal og midler for den art  havekunst  saa var det i tyskland en enkelt mand  willy lange  der  vaesentlig ad taenkningens vej og paa videnskabeligt grundlag  de tyskere  bliver jo sig selv lig alle dage  fastslog regler for en landskabelig  havekunst  der i modsaetning til den aeldre kan passes ind i en lille  ramme  lange  hvis hovedskrift  gartengerstaltung der neuzeit  udkom        og som senere er trykt i flere tusinder end nogen anden tysk bog  om havekunst  gor ganske overordentlig stort brug af stauder til at  skabe sine smaa vegetations scenerier          footnote    en hovedsag for lange er hensyntagen til planternes  naturlige samhorighed  det vil sige  at planter  der horer hjemme  eller  ser ud som de horte hjemme i et bestemt fysisk milieu ikke plantes  jaevnsides med planter fra et ganske andet  for eksempel bor en plante   der baerer de torre  sandede steders karaktermaerke  ikke saettes ved siden  af en plante  hvis store  saftige blade viser  at den horer hjemme under  fugtige forhold  ved at folge denne regel skaffes en typisk  plantebestand og typiske vegetationsbilleder  der dog udmaerket kan  bestaa af planter  der er foraedlede ved kultur  naar de kun har bevaret  deres oprindelige karakter  meningen er jo ikke at illudere  skont lange  har en stor og troende menighed og miss jekyll talrige efterlignere  vil  denne form for havekunst  dog naeppe faa betydning udover en meget stor  indirekte  bl  a  ved at vaekke interessen for stauder  idet den  der  planlaegger en saadan plantning  i det vaesentlige ogsaa selv maa udfore  den  tankerne kan jo nemlig ikke  som ved et andet haveanlaeg  gives en  koncis  latent form i en tegning  det vil desuden altid vaere et  forholdsvis ringe antal mennesker  der paa en gang vil vaere i besiddelse  af tilstraekkelig faerdighed og viden og tilstraekkelig forstaaelse til at  kunne udfore vedligeholdelsen i anlaegets aand  en del plads kraeves jo  ogsaa  saa denne wild gardening altid vil vaere forbeholdt de faa  i  populariseret og skematiseret form har denne art havekunst iovrigt  betingelser for at udarte til noget meget slemt  i tyskland  hvor de jo  har ondt ved at holde balancen  ses allerede gravsteder     i willy  langes maner      naar saaledes stauderne i den senere tid er blevne staerkt forbedrede  og  fordom med hensyn til deres kultur er ved at fjernes  og endelig  forholdene inden for havekunsten er de gunstigst mulige  vil man  forstaa  at disse planters staerke fremrykning ikke er tilfaeldig  og at  pelargonierne maa glaede  sig over  at de i hvert fald har storstaedernes  altankasser at falde tilbage paa  denne unaturlige form for  blomsterdekoration er vist det eneste  stauderne ikke lader sig anvende  til      illustration  fig     plantning at funkia og andre stauder i en gaard  ved et engelsk landsted            staudernes anvendelse     de vidt divergerende former hos stauderne  der rummer baade buskformede   taeppedannende  opretvoksende og krybende  pudeformede og sivdannede  planter  og deres vidt forskellige krav til livet  samlet sammen som de  er fra al verdens marker og moser  klipper og skove  giver deres  anvendelse en udstraekning og en alsidighed  som er ukendt inden for  andre samfund af haveplanter  naesten enhver tanke  der gaelder  haveudsmykning med blomster  kan finde udtryk gennem dette mangeartede  materiale  og naesten hver plet jord  hvor andet forsager  kan klaedes med  en eller anden art stauder      rabatten   det vil sige et langstrakt bed  i reglen langs med en gang   er vel det forste og oprindeligste formelle udtryk for havens udsmykning  med blomster og er stadig den form  som lettest lader sig underordne  havens plan og som bedst forener glaeden ved besiddelsen og betragtningen  af de enkelte planter  men den rent dekorative effekt  rabatten er det  grundlag  hvorpaa den rent umiddelbare kaerlighed til blomsterne   liebhaveriet  samlerglaeden bedst kan modes med den rent architektoniske  straeben efter at skabe skonhed af helheden  og den er ikke udtryk for et  kompromis  hvor de to i reglen staerkt modstridende saet interesser har  maattet slaa af paa kravene for at modes  tvaertimod byder rabatten langs  en gang den bedste lejlighed til at betragte de enkelte blomster  medens  paa den anden side den vegetative fylde bunden af rabattens klare  enkelte form bedre end nogen anden blomsterdekoration formaar baade at  fremhaeve og at underordne sig havens linier  intet under at man derfor i  england  hvor baade liebhaveriet og havekunsten har faaet sit hojeste  udtryk  altid har plantet stauder fortrinsvis i rabatter og har drevet  kunsten at arrangere saadanne  rent aestetisk set  op til en her i  landet ukendt hojde og forovrigt ogsaa  som det altid gaar med den store  iver  et godt stykke ud over maalet     staudernes fejl  de enkelte arters korte blomstringstid  lader sig  lettest bekaempe ved en anvendelse af mange til forskellig tid  blomstrende arter  og denne mangfoldighed lader sig igen lettest  beherske under rabattens form  i smaa villahaver  hvor gruppernes antal  maa vaere begraenset  vil disse  der sjaeldent kan sammensaettes af mere end  et par arter  lade haven i alt for hyppige og lange perioder vaere uden  blomster  og tyngdepunktet i havens udsmykning vil flyttes snart hid  snart did  eftersom de enkelte grupper kommer i blomst  ganske  anderledes med rabatten  der i lang tid viser blomster og altid i hele  sin udstraekning er til pryd  saaledes at ligevaegten ikke forrykkes  det  er paa grund af rabattens velegnethed til netop at vaere den lille haves   villahavens form for staudedyrkning  at dens sammensaetning og  tilplantning  i overensstemmelse med denne bogs plan  bliver genstand  for en mere indgaaende behandling end de andre former for  staudeanvendelse     ved valget af stauderabattens plads maa der tages hensyn til  vaekstbetingelserne  se under staudernes kultur   og til at rabatten kan  komme til at tage sig saa meget som muligt ud til sin fordel  set fra et  bestemt punkt i haven  den ideelle beliggenhed er saaledes  at rabatten  fra vedkommende punkt  det vaere sig nu havens indgang  husets veranda  eller et lysthus  ses vaesentligst paa langs  naar den ligger vinkelret  paa synslinien  virker den selvfolgeligt langt mindre fyldigt  af samme  grund er krumme rabatter uheldige  og jo skarpere kurven er  desto  mindre virker de  den fordelagtigste beliggenhed kraever endvidere  at  den ses mod solen  blomsterne drejer sig som bekendt naesten alle i meget  hoj grad efter solen  og selv om denne tilbojelighed ikke gor nogen  saerlig virkning for den enkelte blomsts vedkommende  saa er en let  drejning af en rabats blomstermyriader af maegtig virkning  hvad enhver  vil kunne overbevise sig om ved en sommerdag at betragte den samme rabat  fra nord og fra syd     virkningen kan yderligere foroges  ved at rabatten har en let haeldning  mod gangen og mod iagttagerens standpunkt  det vil naturligvis vaere  forholdsvis sjaeldent  at alt saaledes kan forenes til at skabe en saa  koncentreret effekt set fra et punkt  og det vil jo i reglen ogsaa  betyde en svaekkelse af virkningen iagttaget fra andre steder af haven   hvis rabatten er dobbelt d v s  at to rabatter flankerer en gang  og  hvis de har samme bredde og blomstrer samtidigt  saa vil en beliggenhed  i nord og syd vaere meget at foretraekke  eller maaske rettere udtrykt  to  symmetriske rabatter bor  saerlig naar de har haekke som baggrund  ikke  laegges i ost vest  idet den nordlige da vil opnaa meget storre glans end  den sydlige paa grund af  at de hojere stauder og baggrunden vil skygge  over dele af den sydlige rabat  uligheden vil altid vaere folelig og  virke uheldigt  naar forholdene er ugunstige for symmetriske rabatter   bor man overveje muligheden af en asymmetrisk ordning  hvis gangen   hvortil rabatterne skal slutte sig  lober i havens nordlige del og i  retningen ost vest  det drejer sig naturligvis om en mindre have  vil  det ofte vaere smukt at have en haek eller anden hoj baggrund bag den  nordligste rabat  og saa beplante denne med vaesentlig hoje stauder   medens den sydlige rabat beplantes med lutter lavere planter og laegges   uden baggrund af haek eller andet  direkte op til plaenen  alene en staerk  fremtraedende forskellig bredde vil hjaelpe over ulemperne ved den  dobbelte rabat i ost vest retningen  hvis der ikke findes en baggrund  for blomsterne  men rabatten fores tvaers over en aaben plaene eller  gennem en kokkenhave  vil man  forudsat man undgaar storre  sammenhaengende plantninger af hoje stauder  og der ellers ikke kastes  skygger ind over rabatterne  vaere ret frit stillet med hensyn til  beliggenheden i de forskellige vindhjorner      illustration  kelway   son  langport  fig     blandet stauderabat   tilplantet med stor dygtighed      belysningen af rabatten maa vaere ensartet  hvis en bygning eller et trae  kaster skygge over den ene ende  medens den anden ligger i fuld sol  vil  man faa en utiltalende uligevaegt i blomstens fylde og glans  denne  ulempe kan modvirkes i ikke ringe grad  naar der til de skyggede pladser  vaelges stauder  der taaler at undvaere sol  men at traeffe et saadant valg  og faa det til at passe med de ovrige dele af rabatten  er ikke hver  mands sag     med hensyn til bredden  saa kan den variere fra en ganske smal stribe  til en maegtig bredde  kun maa der naturligvis vaere forhold i tingene   for at en smuk virkning skal naas  billedet  fig     viser en maegtig  bred stauderabat  der imidlertid staar i udmaerket forhold til gangen og  til hampton courts vidtloftige slotsfloj  foruden de tilstodende ganges  bredde og hele havens karakter  maa selvfolgelig forholdet til laengden   d v s  det fra et sted synlige del af rabattens laengde  tages med i  betragtning  selve plantematerialet og arrangementet deraf spiller en  stor rolle ved fastsaettelsen af dimensionerne  eller maaske snarere  omvendt  en urolig  staerkt vekslende beplantning kan lettere fylde en  bred rabat end et i form og farve monotont arrangement  af hensyn til  beplantningen kan en almindelig sommer og efteraarsrabat ikke godt vaere  under   m bred  medens en foraarsrabat kan vaere betydelig smallere paa  grund af de i reglen mindre planter  man er altid noget tilbojelig til  at anlaegge gangene ved en rabat lidt for smalle  man maa jo erindre  at  de  foruden deres egentlige bestemmelse  tillige har den  at virke med i  helheden  at danne en rolig flade som passende modsaetning til al  blomsternes overvaettes fylde og liv i en vellykket plantning  i stedet  for en gruset gang  kan man paa engelsk maner have en graeslagt gang  men  en saadan kraever vanding  tromling og maskinslaaning og i det hele en  pleje  som

nogenlunde kont lov hele aaret  eller i hvert fald  hele sommeren igennem  egner sig til dette brug  disse kantplanter  kraever imidlertid en hyppig omplantning for ikke at blive for brede og  uregelmaessige  mange af dem har ogsaa den fejl  at frosten borttager  planter hist og her og derved bryder raekken  og i det hele er stauder  som kant behaeftede med den meget vaesentlige fejl  at de

buxbom er den lettest mulige   og den er aldrig for fremtraedende  som de blomstrende kanter til tider  kan vaere  den indskraenker sig til at fungere som afgraensning og gor  dette mere skarpt og mere klart end nogen anden plante  buxbom vil vaere  den kant  der under alle almindelige forhold vil vaere at foretraekke     hvor det drejer sig om en almindelig af mange forskellige planteformer  sammensat rabat  det vil sige en plantning  der vil vaere jo mere  vellykket jo storre dens frodighed og fylde  dens overdaadighed i  vekslende former og farver er   gaelder det netop at have en enkelt   sober og klar kant  hvilket igen vil sige  at en stenkant vil virke  bedst  netop modsaetningen mellem indholdets  d v s  staudevegetationens  uregerlige fylde og den strenge lige kantlinie er af den allerstorste  virkning  dette er ganske analogt med saa mange tilfaelde  hvor  vegetation og architektur modes  enhver kender det ualmindelig smukke  syn af ranker  der haenger ud over en

over  kanten  og ej heller skal man  om en staude bryder ud af geleddet   vaelter sig frem i forste raekke og stikker blomsterhovederne ud over  kanten  straks vaere parat med stokke og bast  paa den anden side maa man  vaere forsigtig med ikke at arrangere noget saadant  den slags ting  ordner naturen altid bedst selv  mursten  maaske helst munkesten    anbragte enten i loberskifte eller i kopskifte danner en fortrinlig  kant  og det er vel den eneste art stenkant  man her i landet kan faa  for en rimelig penge  de i handelen vaerende lange  smalle cementkantsten  er ogsaa gode  men mange mennesker naerer jo en maerkelig uvilje mod dette  fortrinlige materiale  hvis forholdene ellers tillader det  saa danner  almindelige fliser mellem to rabatter paa samme tid kanter og gang

rabatten i sin enkleste form bestaar kun af en planteart  enten i samme  eller i flere varieteter  og i denne form er rabatten egentlig kun en  langstrakt gruppe og altsaa behaeftet med staudegruppernes fejl   blomstringens kortvarighed  der gor den mindre vaerdifuld for de ganske  smaa haver  det  der maa kraeves af en saadan rabat  er at planterne i  saa lang tid som muligt uden for den egentlige blomstringsperiode ser  nogenlunde tiltalende ud  d v s  enten at de blomstrer sent  for  blomstringen ser de fleste stauder meget tiltalende ud  eller at de som  paeoner og lupin bevarer lovet kont laenge efter afblomstringen  eller  endelig  at de som pyrethrum  viola cornuta og bellis remonterer hen paa  sommeren  der er enkelte planter  der som paeon og pyrethrum egner sig  mindre godt for den sammensatte rabat  og som derfor helst maa staa for  sig selv  heldigvis har netop disse to slaegter et par arter  paeonia   albiflora og pyrethrum roseum  der er saa uendelig rige paa varieteter   at en saadan rabat kan oplives ved det rigeste spil af farvenuancer  det  sidste tiaar har bragt en raekke forbedringer paa baade pyrethrums og  paeonernes omraade  som man ikke havde dromt om tidligere  hundredevis af  de pragtfyldte sorter staar til publikums raadighed  og der drives i  england og amerika en sand luksus med disse blomster  og der betales  ofte en snes kroner for stykket af de nyeste og smukkeste sorter  man  kan trostigt sammensaette disse rabatter  som man lyster  alle farverne  klaeder hverandre udmaerket  dette gaelder derimod ikke  hvis man danner en  rabat af phlox paniculata  der iovrigt ogsaa egner sig til en   enartsrabat   denne plantes sortiment spaender nemlig over et par  farver  blaalilla og skarlagenrodt  der ikke saa godt passer til de  ovrige  man maa her enten undgaa disse farver eller mildne de vaerste  sammenstod f  eks  mellem lysviolet  antonin mercie  og brunligt purpur   reichsgraf von hochberg  ved at stro rigeligt hvide eller meget lyse  farver imellem  lovrigt skal man ikke vaere for aengstelig  der opstaar  ofte ganske uforvarende pikante disharmonier  der virker pudsigt uden at  odelaegge helheden  det eneste  man skal undgaa  og det gaelder naesten i  hele staudeverdenen    er at det rene skarlagenrode  phlox dr   koenigshoefer   denne knaldrode pelargonie farve afstedkommer naesten altid  ulykker     denne rabat med kun en art kan udvides til to  tre  fire og flere arter   der kan aflose hverandre  eksempelvis kan en paeonrabat gennemvaeves med  paaskelilier  men der maa ligge mindst en halv snes log samlede i  klumper  naar disse blomstrer  det skal vaere af de tidlige sorter  vil  paeonerne netop staa med unge brune spirer godt over jorden og vil danne  en smuk helhed sammen med de gule narcisblomster  til aflosning af  paeonfloraen kan der mellem planterne laegges lilier  paeonernes blade vil  da skjule  at lilierne ofte er nogne og visne paa det nederste stykke af  stilken  en saadan rabat kan ligge urort i en halv snes aar eller  laengere uden at tiltraenge omplantning  idet de tre naevnte staudeslaegter  horer til dem  der ikke ofte behover omplantning  se kulturen   iris  og  i det hele alle slaegter med stort farvesortiment  egner sig til den art  rabatter  idet formens ensartethed klaeder farvernes vrimmel  og det  forholder sig naesten altid saa  at farvevariationerne indbyrdes  harmonerer  phlox danner som naevnt en undtagelse     gamle dages stauderabat bestod gerne af en eller to raekker planter  anbragte med samme indbyrdes afstand ligesom knapperne i en frakke  men  denne maade  den ganske vist lader de enkelte planters habitus traede  tydeligt frem  har den fejl  for det forste  at den  grundet paa de alt  for faa planter  ikke giver rabatten nogen videre betydning som  udsmykning af haven  og for det andet  at den lader den nogne jord se  alt for meget mellem planterne  mulden kan vaere smuk  naar den er  nyvendt  men naar den forst er klasket af regn og hvidnet af sol  er den  alt andet end tiltalende  og man foretraekker da ogsaa nu i almindelighed  at folge naturens eksempel og altid lade vegetation daekke mulden  den  kan jo kun holdes nogen ved arbejde og i naturen finder man klipper og  sten og sand nogent  men aldrig udaekket muld  i hvert fald er det da  daekket af lov  de naevnte gammeldags rabatter egner sig bedst til  videnskabelige plantesamlinger  hvor en straeng sondring mellem planterne  er nodvendig  og hvor det dekorative moment kommer i anden raekke     en af de storste fejl  der kan begaas ved ordningen af blomsterne i en  have  er at sprede dem jaevnt over hele haven  dels er det upraktisk  og  dels gaar naesten al dekorativ virkning tabt  det gaelder fremfor alt at  koncentrere saa meget som muligt  hvis man har mere end en rabat  eller  hvis ejendommen kun bebos en tid af aaret  kan man mangedoble  blomsternes dekorative effekt ved i den enkelte rabat at samle planter   der alle blomstrer samtidigt og saaledes i nogle faa maaneder  vedligeholde et forstaerket flor     de egentlige stauder overvintrer jo i reglen ikke noget videre af deres  overjordiske del  og det ligger derfor i sagens natur  at alle de  planter  der baerer blomsterne hojt til vejrs paa lange stilke  maa have  en vis tid til at udvikle sig  og derfor vil man ogsaa se  at naesten  alle hoje stauder er ret sildigblomstrende  medens de foraarsblomstrende  i reglen bestaar af lavere planter  heraf folger at en foraarsrabat i  blomst fra april til juni lettest fremstilles som en lav plantning af  alle mulige  alpine   krybende og pudedannende planter  medens en  sommerblomstrende lettest dannes af mellemhoje og en efteraarsrabat af  meget hoje stauder  der findes dog en maengde undtagelser fra denne  hovedregel     en lav foraarsrabat kan  af hensyn til den vaekstejendommelighed ved de  pudedannede planter  at de blomstrer rigest paa pudens sider  ikke  plantes helt taet  man vil staa sig ved at lade de enkelte  plantegrupper  hver  pude  maa selvfolgelig i overensstemmelse med den  almindelige regel for staudeplantning bestaa af en lille koloni af  planter  mere eller mindre isolerede  selv om man for afvekslings skyld  af og til gor brud paa denne regel og endda lader et par arter blande  sig mellem hverandre  den frie plads  der opstaar mellem  plantegrupperne  er det ikke let at udfylde  man kan lade den graa  antennaria brede sig som et taeppe i mellemrummene  men det vil  da dette  taeppe stadig skal klippes og navnlig ikke maa genere rabattens egentlige  bestand og derfor maa holdes i ave  foraarsage et stort  vedligeholdelsesarbejde  bedre er det at anvende sten  saaledes at  rabatten bliver et  stenbed  af lighed med dem  der anvendes i  gartnerier til udskoling af  stenhojsplanter  og forsyne dem med storre  eller mindre sten  trykkede let ned i jorden  rabatten bor i saa fald  helst ligge rigeligt over gangen og vaere noget oprundet mod midten  de  hvide skaerver  som faas ved kalkbrud  kan ogsaa anvendes i deres  forskellige storrelser  og skont det vist aldrig har vaeret provet  er  forfatteren tilbojelig til at tro  at et lag groft grus over jorden vil  vaere anvendeligt  i hvert fald at foretraekke for den nogne jord  der som  naevnt ovenfor kun i ny behandlet tilstand er smuk  dette foraarsflor  skal i reglen have megen sol og helst ligge paa et ikke fugtigt sted   udsat for frisk luft  er forholdene anderledes  kan man dog af primula   aurikler og mange slags logvaekster danne en tilsvarende rabat  der  taaler lidt skygge og mere indelukket luft     paa grund af planternes lave vaekst  bor en saadan rabat selvfolgelig  ikke have den bredde  som vil vaere passende for hojtvoksende blomster   o   a     meter vil under almindelige forhold danne henholdsvis minimums  og maximums bredde  i resten af aaret ser de fleste af disse  foraarsplanter nydelige ud  naar de da ellers behandles rigtig med  afskaering af visne blomster o s v   idet mange af dem er planter  der  som ajuga  aubrietia  iberis  lave phlox  arabis  alyssum o s v   beholder deres lov uskadt  og endogsaa med de mange brunlige  graalige  og gronne schatteringer danner det sarteste farvespil  naturligvis af en  hel anden karakter end den  der udfoldes under blomstringen  men ofte af  en blid ynde  der en solet efteraarsdag kan virke ganske betagende     med en beplantning af juli og augustblomstrende stauder  en  skaersommerrabat  kan man med delphinium i hovedrollen vel nok fremstille  den maegtigste virkning  der overhovedet kan naas med blomster  men en  saadan rabat har den fejl  at den efter afblomstringen ser grim ud  og  den vil i almindelighed kun vaere at anbefale  hvor der findes adskillige  rabatter eller tilstraekkelige gartneriske hjaelpemidler  saaledes at der  kan dyrkes et saet chrysantemum og aster amellus  der i slutningen af  august kan henplantes i rabatten og fortsaette sommerens flor  ejere af  sommerhuse  der kun bruges i ferien  vil naturligvis netop have glaede af  en saadan plantning     til mere almindeligt brug  eller rettere til brug i det videst mulige  omfang  egner sig derimod en rabat sammensat af baade sommer og  efteraarsblomstrende planter  idet den kan holdes i flor lige til frost  og vaede laegger alt ode  i tiden indtil st  hans vil en saadan rabat  aldeles ikke virke skaemmende  selv om den er ganske uden blomst  idet  netop disse unge spirende  saftspaendte planter er i besiddelse af en  frisk og lofterig skonhed  som de samme planter ganske savner efter  blomstringen     i storre haver og under storre forhold vil en bred rabat af  efteraarsasters og sildige gyldenris  chrysantemum og andet  sildigtblomstrende materiale vaere til stor glaede  navnlig hvis vi er saa  heldige at faa et sommerligt efteraar  ellers er disse i meget sildige  blomster her i landet ofte tilbojelige til at  snadske  vaek i de lange  naetters regn  uden at den magteslose sol formaar at live dem op igen om  dagen  isaer er det slemt naar rabatten ikke ligger frit  hvor sol og  vind kan torre lidt paa blomsterne  ogsaa i den almindelige sommer og  efteraarsrabat skal man give afkald paa det allersildigste  ellers vil  rabattens sidste dage blive et altfor langvarigt og pinligt farvel til  den svindende sommer     naar man paa en gang skal naa to maal  en fri  let og malerisk   gruppering   saaledes som det nu en gang bedst klaeder dette  blomstermateriale  og paa den anden side opnaa en vis ro og orden i  fordelingen  en vis ligevaegt  saa bliver det selvfolgelig som ved de  fleste aestetiske sporgsmaal en sejlads mellem scylla og karybdis med  fare for at styre for naer skematisk stivhed paa den ene side og planlos  uorden paa den anden     bestaar rabatten kun af faa arter  saa er fordelingen selvfolgelig  ganske ligetil  den bor vaere jaevn og ensartet  hvis man derimod  hvad  der i almindelighed vil vaere tilfaeldet  sammensaetter sin rabat af en  maengde af stauderigets slaegter  bliver fordelingen vanskeligere  den bor  ske under tre hovedpunkter  blomstringstid  vaekst og farve     med hensyn til blomstringstid er der naeppe delte meninger om  at kun en  vej er den rette  nemlig at fordele de blomstringstider  som rabatten  spaender over  saa jaevnt som muligt over hele laengden  man vil naesten  aldrig paa dette omraade lobe fare for at faa fordelingen altfor  omhyggelig  idet planterne i saa henseende dels er meget forskellige de  forskellige aar og dels i lobet af deres alder forskyder  blomstringstiden lidt  men naesten alle i forskellig grad  hvad  fordelingen efter vaekst angaar  saa er sporgsmaalet her vanskeligere   idet man her  hvis man er noje kendt med sit materiale  kan lobe den  risiko ved en for omhyggelig opstilling  at berove rabatten det liv som  planternes store formrigdom kan give  at de store planter i  almindelighed skal bagest og de smaa forrest folger af sig selv  ellers  vilde de jo skjule hverandres blomster og vaesentlig forringe  vaekstbetingelserne for de lavere planter  naar det ikke overdrives vil  det vaere af fortrinlig virkning af og til at gore et rask brud paa denne  hovedregel og lade en mellemhoj plante af karakteristisk vaekst  f  eks   en kniphofia eller en yucca blive anbragt naer kanten  alle slags  planter  som chelone  campanula persicifolia og andre  hvor

anthemis kelwayi  kan ogsaa  undtagelsesvis faa lov at vaelte sig ud over kanten  der kan fremkaldes  variation i rabattens indre  ved at man f  eks  lader en stor gruppe  phlox paniculata  som en vaeldig bug naerme sig forgrunden paa et sted   hvor plantningen ellers er holdt ganske lav  forsidens lave planter kan  man lade skyde fjorde ind mellem de hoje planter og endogsaa lade dem  naerme sig baggrunden  naar ellers naboernes habitus tillader dette  alle  disse naevnte tilfaelde bor vaere undtagelser  og hovedreglen bor vaere den  naturlige  at de hoje er bagerst og de lave forrest  man skal nodig  anvende en art  der rager paafaldende op over de andre  i saa fald maa  den da plantes gentagelsesvis flere gange  dog ikke med nojagtigt  ligestore mellemrum og heller ikke i ganske nojagtig samme antal i hver  gruppe      illustration  kgl  danske haveselskab  fig      fra bredden af dammen i  det kgl  danske haveselskabs have      anvendelsen af kun en plante paa hver plads var en af hovedfejlene ved  staudeplantningen i tidligere tider og er det tildels endnu  man kan  nemlig aldeles ikke vente nogetsomhelst andet end et ret trosteslost  resultat af en rabat  hvor planterne ikke er anvendte flere af hver  samlede i smaagrupper eller kolonier  det er en egenskab ved stauder  og  det gaelder vistnok for naesten al blomsterdekoration  at forst i flok  formaar de at yde en vis virkning  man ser da heller aldrig begonier   lobelia eller andre udplantningsplanter anvendte enkeltvis  hvorfor man  har negligeret denne fundamentale regel for staudernes vedkommende  naar  den er bragt i anvendelse for sommerplanternes  er egentlig  ubegribeligt  maaske skyldes det liebhaveriet  imidlertid er det jo  meget  tilladeligt  om man ogsaa paa den maade oger variationen  at man  her og der planter en enkelt plante af een sort  grupperne eller  kolonierne maa nodig i for hoj grad blive lige store  bor ikke heller  vaere for kompakte eller runde  tvaertimod vil en lidt langagtig gruppe   der i sine ekstremer oploser sig lidt  saaledes at nabogruppernes  forlobere kan finde en plads i dens udkanter  ofte vaere det heldigste   man beholder paa den maade den virkning  som massen frembringer og  undgaar det klumpede i arrangementet  den faerdighed  der skal udoves ved  tilplantningen af en rabat  er den samme  som den maa besidde  der skal  binde en krans eller pynte en vase smukt og frit  kun at den  der  planter rabatter  gaar og arbejder med nogle ret ensartede og uanselige  rodklumper og smaaplanter  hvis fremtidige vaekst og farvepragt han maa  nojes med at genkalde i erindringen  for at kunne gore det med blot  nogenlunde sikkerhed  kraeves der baade et solidt plantekendskab og en  klart arbejdende fantasi  der ved synet af en etikette med et latinsk  navn nojagtigt genkalder billedet af planten paa de forskellige  udviklingstrin  det er selvfolgeligt meget vanskeligt  og det er da  ogsaa en trost for os alle  at det vist er grumme faa mennesker  der kan  tumle med et saadant fantasistof  og det er en anden og bedre trost  at  naturen er saa uendelig barmhjertig  naar mennesken blot gor lidt og  viser den gode vilje  saa gor den resten  saaledes at resultatet i  reglen bliver godt     ikke mindst ved en foraarsrabat af lave og pudedannende planter maa man  netop paa grund af staudernes lavhed og ofte kompakte form passe paa  ikke at danne en raekke ensartede  runde klumper  aflange kolonier  helst  lagte saaledes  at deres laengdeakse danner en spids vinkel med rabattens  kanter  og saaledes at de kun undtagelsesvis stoder direkte op baade til  forkant og bagkant  vil vaere at foretraekke  idet rabatten ellers let   set paa langs  kommer til at se ud  som om den var afdelt i striber paa  tvaers  for alle de blandede grupper gaelder det  at der skal vaere store  flager af farver  ellers gor den ingen virkning i sin helhed  men den  bliver selvfolgelig saa meget mere vaerd  om man mellem denne  hovedbestand har drysset enkelte planter der  efter at man har nydt  skuet af rabatten i sin helhed  kan fremkalde en fornyet og dybere  interesse ved en betragtning i detailler  hvis der ikke er stof til et  saadant detailstudium  vil rabatten let for et mere kultiveret  havepublikum reduceres til et havearchitektonisk paradenummer  mange  blomster er jo interessante og vidunderlig skonne  selv om

og skarlagen  til den anden  eller rabatter af kun to farver  f  eks  hvidt og blaat   man undgaar dog saa gerne det rene blaa  som det findes i anchusa og  visse delphinium  idet det kun vanskeligt

thi det vigtigste af alt ved  fordelingen  d v s  ligevaegten  opretholdes af de ledende planter  der  dominerer i kraft af deres antal og iojnefaldende skonhed  og som  afloser hverandre som baerer af en vis rythmisk inddeling  der sikrer  at  rabatten i hele sin udstraekning til enhver tid er i nogenlunde samme  grad smykket med blomster  det kan paa denne maade ikke undgaas  at en  enkelt farve vil blive den dominerende i en bestemt tid  i juli vil de  blaa delphinium herske  i august de rode phlox  der afloses af alt det  meget gule  der blomstrer i sensommer og host  og tilsidst vil aaret  sluttes af med asterssorternes mange lilla nuancer  som den dominerende  farve  dette saerlige praeg for hver aarstid er saa langt fra en ulempe   at det netop er et udtryk for staudeplanternes storre vaerdi i  sammenligning med udplantningsplanter og roser     med en saadan rythmisk gruppering er rabatten med de hoje stauder i  anlaegget ved hellerup lystbaadehavn tilplantet   fig      og

naevnt den ren  skarlagenrode  pelargoniefarven som den findes i enkelte phlox og hos  lychnis  denne knaldrode farve har en egen aevne til at gore sig uheldigt  gaeldende og falder udenfor staudernes egentlige farvegebet     ligesom sporgsmaalet om grupperingen i en rabat under hensyn til de tre  hovedmomenter  vaekst  blomstringstid og farve  egentlig kun rummer  vanskeligheder ved rabatter sammensatte af mange arter  saaledes rummer  ogsaa sporgsmaalet om  planteafstanden  kun vanskelighed i den art  tilfaelde  hvor der kun anvendes to eller tre plantearter  der vil  selv  om varieteternes antal er aldrig saa stort  planteafstanden naturligvis  vaere den samme i hele rabatten og vil let kunne fastslaas for den  enkelte art  ved den artsrige rabat kan der derimod slet ikke opstilles  almindelige regler  man maa kende hver enkelt arts voksemaade og  derefter tildele den pladsen  en ting er i hvert fald nodvendigt  der  maa plantes taet  langt taettere end man saedvanligt ser  og taettere  end  hvis det gjaldt om at opnaa saa velkultiverede eksemplarer som muligt   den her omhandlede beplantningsmaade har  selv om det selvfolgelig ikke  drejer sig om en imitation af naturen  dog i mangt og meget sit  forbillede i den vildtvoksende plantebestand og soger at bibeholde  plantens naturlige vaekst og at laere af den yndefulde maade  hvorpaa de  indbyrdes grupperer sig  noget af det mest iojnefaldende ved  vildtvoksende planter er  at de staar taet  d v s  at jorden mellem dem  slet ikke ses  klipper  sten og nogne sandbrinker ses  men aldrig  mulden  det er imod dens natur at vaere udaekket  man skal derfor altid  lade lave og krybende planter daekke bunden i rabattens forgrund  bagved  behoves det ikke  og det vilde ogsaa i altfor hoj grad besvaerliggore  arbejdet  om al jord var daekket med planter  ved brede rabatter skal der  endogsaa helst lobe en sti  en couloire de service  hvor man kan faerdes  under arbejdet  en saadan sti kan ogsaa lobe mellem rabatten og  baghaekken  saa denne kan faa lys forneden og blive klippet  hvis en  rabat udelukkende bestaar af hoje stauder  og der foran er en kant af  buxbom  vil man ofte gore klogt i at plante en indre kant af ajuga eller  cerastium  der holdes i ave med saksen paa den mod buxbommen vendende  side  men faar lov at lobe frit ind imellem de forreste planter  paa den  maade kan buxbomkanten skaanes for en altfor generende naerhed af store  graadige planter     for at der ikke ved en plantes henvisnen og nedskaering skal opstaa et  hul  bor man beregne det saaledes  at de mere tidligtblomstrende planter  anbringes paa en i forhold til deres hojde noget tilbagetrukken plads   paa den maade skjules de lettest af senere blomstrende naboer     alle stauder  der har en uregerlig

rabat er beregnet paa mange maaneders flor  maaske fra april til  november  vil der ifolge sagens natur fremkomme bare pletter  hvor en  gruppe stauder er afblomstrede  maa man derfor paase  at planter  der  efter deres blomstring ser grimme ud  ikke plantes i for store udelte  grupper  men mellemplantes med sildige arter  i en rabat med lang  blomstring kan man  hvor omhyggeligt man end ordner alt  dog ikke  undvaere supplementsplanter  der i lobet af sommeren hjaelper  hovedbestanden med at holde rabatten i tilfredsstillende flor  nedenfor  skal naevnes nogle af de planter  der bedst egner sig til dette brug     mange af de eetaarige planter  der saas direkte paa blivestedet  er  ganske fortrinlige supplementsplanter og dertil saerlig lette at have med  at gore  de skal saas i umiddelbar naerhed af de foraarsblomstrende  stauder  de kan saa ofte sprede et helt blomstertaeppe over disses  nedskaarne stubbe  blandt de allerbedste er de saakaldte shirley  valmuer   papaver

reservebed kan der med suppleringen for oje dyrkes en maengde  stauder  naar blot det er planter  der taaler at flyttes i en mere  fremskreden udvikling  chrysanthemum indicum varieteterne egner sig  saerlig godt til dette brug  dels fordi de taaler at flyttes i knop  ikke  saa godt inden knopdannelsen har fundet sted   og dels fordi den sildige  blomstring gor  at der er saerlig mange huller at fylde  naar  chrysanthemum staar i flor  under storre forhold  hvor den  tilstraekkelige gartneriske hjaelp er tilstede  kan denne supplering af  rabatterne finde sted i udstrakt grad ved hjaelp af reservestauder   dyrkede i staaltraadskurve  ved disses hjaelp kan naesten alle arter  stauder flyttes til enhver tid  almindelige udplantningsplanter  som  findes i handelen er naturligvis det bekvemmeste materiale at anvende  for den almindelige villaejer  og mange af disse planter egner sig ogsaa  udmaerket til at stoppe huller med  men det maa naturligvis vaere planter  med  staudekarakter   saaledes vil pelargonier og begonier ikke gore  fyldest  mens derimod almindelige margueritter  verbena  saerlig arten  venosa   cuphaea  agathaea  antirhinum  gazania  pentstemon  salvia patens  og mange andre er fortrinlige  de lave dvaergtropaeolum har den egenskab   at de i den kraftige rabatjord baerer blomsterne under bladene  saa at de  skjules  hvorfor disse varieteter af tropaeolum er uanvendelige til  supplering i kraftig jord  af andre fremmede planteelementer  der under  visse forhold kan faa plads i stauderabatten er georginer  saerlig de  opretvoksende

men ikke har meget plads  kan saerdeles vel anvende dem i  en stauderabat  baade farver og habitus passer smukt ind mellem stauder   men de volder nogen ulejlighed ved at visne blomster og baelgene stadig  skal afpilles  ellers bliver det hele en stakket glaede     ligesaa fejlagtigt det vilde vaere ganske doktrinaert at holde sig til den  rene staudebestand med udelukkelse af de naevnte supplementsplanter og  ved ikke i givet tilfaelde at drage nytte f  eks  af buske  der  som  buddleja og hydrangea  egner sig til storre stauderabatter  ligesaa  forkert vilde det naturligvis vaere at forskaertse staudekarakteren ved  for megen indblanding af fremmed stof  saerlig vil en storre indblanding  af roser ofte vaere uheldigt     medens der med hensyn til selve plantningen iovrigt skal henvises til  kapitlet om kulturen  skal her blot naevnes  at den letteste maade at  udfore en beplantning paa efter en given beplantningsplan er at inddele  planen i kvadrater paa l m  og derpaa i rabatten anbringe smaapaele  saaledes  at de danner tilsvarende kvadrater  paa den maade kan man  kontrollere  om man af bedet bruger netop det i beplantningsplanen  forudsatte areal  saaledes at man hverken faar for faa planter eller  faar tilovers af dem  men af denne skematiske inddeling maa man  naturligvis ikke lade sig forlede til at ordne planterne raekkevis  det  vilde i de blandede rabatter vaere ganske forkasteligt     den raekkevise ordning kan iovrigt vaere smuk  fordi der derigennem opnaas  en massevirkning ligesaa god  men blot paa en anden maade end ved den  gruppevise  og den har yderligere ved de lange lige raekker blomster  noget vist roligt og fornemt ved sig  som den blandede rabat maa savne   men denne ordning begraenser selvfolgelig arternes antal til nogle ganske  faa      illustration  kgl  danske haveselskab  fig      rabat med iris pallida  i blomst i knuthenborg have      foruden rabatten  der som naevnt saerlig i sin blandede form er den mest  anbefalelsesvaerdige anvendelse af stauder for den mindre villahave  kan  man paa mangfoldige maader gore brug af stauder  og hvert nyt krav  der  stilles  vil give havearchitekten  gartneren eller havevennen anledning  til stadig paa nye maader at frugtbargore det rige stof  dette  at hvert  enkelt tilfaelde egentlig gor krav paa sin selvstaendige losning   vanskeliggor det i hoj grad at give almindelige regler  og intet er  heller naeppe mere skadeligt for haveanlaeg end den direkte og  uselvstaendige anvendelse af forskrifter og skemaer  idet der  bogstaveligt i hvert eneste tilfaelde er saerlige forhold  der gor sig  gaeldende     blandt de almindeligste staudeanvendelser er  kantplantningen   der i og  for sig naturligvis er en simplificeret rabat  hertil egner sig snart  sagt alle lave stauder  der bevarer lovet nogenlunde smukt ogsaa udenfor  blomstringstiden  et par af de allerbedste er  viola cornuta  paa grund  af deres lange blomstringstid  dianthus plumarius og aubrietia i sol   primula i skygge og arabis paa torre steder og vinca under traeer for  eksempel langs en alle  hvor det ellers kniber med at faa en kant til at  gro  naesten alle saxifraga og sedum egner sig til kant  hvor der er  tilstraekkelig sol  lavendel er omtalt ovenfor  jo bredere og hojere  kanten kan vaere  jo storre bliver udvalget  i mange bondehaver ser man  ofte ret store staudearter anvendte til kant  og den derved fremkomne  massevirkning forfejler jo sjaeldent sin virkning  men en kant af  geranium  der er ret almindelig  er jo rigtignok ogsaa kun smuk ca   fjorten dage af aaret  og der er i det hele taget al anledning til at  fraraade saadanne kanter i en lille villahave  paa taasinge anvendes  ofte kanter af astilbe japonica  der i den frugtbare jord og milde klima

ikke  gives  idet de stedlige forhold maa vaere ganske bestemmende  hvad  tilplantningen angaar  saa er en saadan have jo i sine bestanddele ikke  andet end et antal afbrudte rabatter  og de synspunkter  der er gjort  gaeldende ovenfor vil naturligvis ligesaavel her kunne laegges til grund  for beplantningen  de meget hoje stauder maa som regel kun anvendes i  yderkanten  og det vil maaske oftest vaere smukkest  om en saadan lille  have i midten forsynedes med et bassin til vandplanter eller at gangene  lob sammen i et braendpunkt  der markeredes med en figur  en solskive   eller lignende  det vil altid vaere heldigt  om den art saerhaver danner  et rum for sig afgraenset tydeligt til alle sider  det forlener altid et  saadant lille anlaeg med en saerlig hygge  en saadan have yder en  fortrinlig koncentration af blomsternes virkning  der yderligere  foroges  hvis man ogsaa kan opnaa en samtidighed i blomstringen  ved for  eksempel at plante en foraarshave med en samling af alle de lave og  pudedannede foraarsplanter som hovedbestand og med morke  stedsegronne  traeer som en lunende hoj haek om det hele  med nogle faa hojere   foraarsblomstrende stauder i udkanterne

sjaeldent anvendt  men netop stauderne yder det  fortrinligste materiale til dette brug  hvor vilde ikke en irishave vaere  smuk  rigtig plantet vilde den vaere i blomst i maanedsvis  og vilde  med  jaevn anvendelse af slaegtens mange arter og varieteter og med forstaerket  brug af nogle af de mest rigtblomstrende og iojnefaldende sorter  danne  en vidunderlig helhed og samtidig byde plantesamleren og liebhaveren  rigelig naering for hans stilfaerdige og fornemme passion  glaeden over  arters og variationers mangfoldighed     der findes en klasse haveplanter  som vi paa dansk betegner med  kolektivnavnet  stenhojsplanter   baade paa fransk  engelsk og tysk  kaldes de samme planter for alpeplanter  hvad der naturligvis for saa  vidt er misvisende  som baade pyrenaeernes og appeninernes hojtliggende  bjaergskraaninger har ydet omtrent det samme bidrag til denne flora som  selve alperne  men navnet  stenhojsplanter  er ikke alene misvisende  da  disse planter ikke behover en hoj for at kunne vokse  men det er yderst  uheldigt  fordi der ved det klaeber forestillingen om stenhoje  som for  mange staar som toppunktet af den raekke misforstaaelser og smaglosheder   der indtil de allersidste aar har vaeret raadende  navnlig i den lille  haves anlaeg  af disse planter  der maaske kan betegnes som   stenplanter   kan der ogsaa dannes en saerhave  uden at man behover at  straebe efter at faa stablet et lille materhorn op  man kan dyrke  planterne paa stenbede  det vil sige saerlig veldraenede  noget oprundede  bede  belagt med jaevnstore sten  der trykkes halvt ned i bedet i  liggende stilling  man maa ikke  som det ses ved stenhoje  saette stenene  paa enden  mellemrummene udfyldes med planterne  hvis blode  blomstrende  taepper og tuer fremhaeves af de haarde  kolde sten  dette mode mellem  organisk og uorganisk  enten det er paa mosgroede sten  vedbendklaedte  mure eller blot lidt ukrudt mellem fliser  forfejler aldrig sin virkning  paa menneskenes sind  ved saadanne stenbede faar planterne de  betingelser for deres vaekst  de skal have  og man slipper for at faa  stenene til at optraede som selvstaendige dekorationsgenstande  som ved  den gammeldags stenhoj      illustration  kgl  danske haveselskab  fig      typisk stenhojsplante   iberis sempervirens      andre saerhaver  som haver af duftende blomster eller haver med blomster  udelukkende i en

variationer     ved plantning af stauder i  grupper  kommer deres brist d v s  de  enkelte arters korte blomstringstid staerkest frem  denne fejl kan  naturligvis modvirkes ved at man planter to eller flere til forskellig  tid blomstrende arter sammen  men dette vil selvfolgelig i reglen betyde  en svaekkelse af den massevirkning  som er gruppens vaesentligste raison  d etre  en gruppe delphinium som den paa fig     viste  vil man dog  kunne gore fornojelig uden at forringe antallet af delphinium ved at  laegge den fuld af narcisser  og senere paa aaret  naar delphiniumerne er  visne og nedskaarne  kan den tilplantes med chrysanthemum  der dog maa  fjernes igen  hvor der er skygge  kan en gruppe af strudsevingebregner  mellemplantet med darwin tulipaner anbringes  i staerk skygge

 naar der ellers er  forhold mellem dens storrelse og gruppens dimensioner  anvendes og med  jo mere held jo bedre planten tager sig ud udenfor blomstringstiden   disse grupper er og bliver dog behaeftede med den fejl  at tyngdepunktet  i havens udsmykning med blomster ikke bliver paa samme sted  hvis der er  flere grupper  og er der kun en enkelt  saa vil haven vaere uden blomster  alt for laenge ad gangen     en haveven kunde taenkes at more sig med at danne farvegrupper ved f   eksempel foran et buskads at samle en del af foraarets gule blomster   doronicum  gule tulipaner  euphorbia

intensitet og deres forskellige flimmer i solen er  en nydelse for de rigtige plantevenner  og den art fornojelse er langt  billigere at opnaa med stauder  som for storste delen vil vaere for  haanden fra omplantningen  end med andre planter  der enten kobes hvert  aar eller besvaerligt overvintres     som  udplantningsplanter  kan stauderne ogsaa anvendes  dog kun de der  let lader sig flytte i

for et  hold chrysanthemum  der igen folges af arabis eller andet tidligt  foraarsblomstrende  med et reservebed og lidt omtanke lader denne  eller  en lignende  succession sig let opretholde  det er i det hele  forbausende  saa lidt stauder anvendes til udplantning  trods det  at  publikum dog stadig lader en folelse af kedsomhed ved de evindelige  begonier og lobelier komme til orde  og man altsaa skulde tro  der var  jordbund for noget nyt  ved slotte og kommunale gartnerier  hvor der  stilles store krav til afvekslingen  og hvor den nodvendige arbejdskraft  er til stede  er man i de senere aar begyndt at anvende stauder til de  vekslende udplantninger  idet planterne dyrkes i de tidligere naevnte  staaltraadskurve  der muliggor en skadeslos transport til og fra  reservebedene  dette betyder naturligvis en maegtig forogelse i  afvekslingsmulighederne  men det er paa den anden side ogsaa et temmelig  kostbart og omstaendeligt arbejde at slaebe omkring med de ofte store  blokke      illustration  kelway   son  langport  fig      gruppe af hoje  delphinium  etter nedskaeringen kan den tilplantes med aster  amellus  eller chrysanthemum       illustration  fig      rabat

opstilling af store stauder i baljer eller kasser og kan ved at have  flere saet opnaa en konstant virkning  denne kultur af stauder og andre  planter i baljer eller kasser burde anvendes langt oftere for at  delagtiggore steder  hvor vaekstbetingelserne er ugunstige  i glaeden over  blomster  i gaarde eller restaurationshaver kunde der skaffes et ofte  haardt tiltraengt skaer af skonhed ved at

stiller selvfolgelig store krav til vanding og ernaering  og  beholderen maa vaere vel draenet  det er ikke heldigt  naar solen braender  for staerkt paa beholderens sider  og dersom planterne er fritstillede   bor de drejes af og til for at blive regelmaessige i vaeksten     det der adskiller den   naturlige  staudeanvendelse  fra de hidtil  omtalte er  at man ved plantningen tilstraeber en efterligning af det  vildtvoksende i enkelte tilfaelde vel endogsaa en ligefrem illusion  i  blandede   malerisk  grupperede rabatter forsoges ganske vist som naevnt  ovenfor at laempe plantningen

om at opnaa  den bevaegelse mod at udviske sporene af  gartnerarbejdet  som planterne altid foretager  naar de lades urorte   benytter man ganske vist ogsaa i rabatten for saa meget som muligt at  bibeholde den ynde i grupperingen  som kun naturen selv formaar at  fremkalde  men man tilstraeber dog alligevel slet ikke det  der tilsigtes  ved den landskabelige plantningsmaade      illustration

kendskab eller for ringe indsats i arbejde eller penge     selv om stauderne  i hvert fald flertallet af de moderne  er  kulturprodukter  der i udseende adskiller sig ikke saa lidt fra de  oprindelige

planterne  hvad enten man nu  forsoger det ene eller det andet  eller  hvad der er det almindeligste   lidt af hvert  saa kraever det noget kendskab baade til planterne og til  de forskellige

maa henvises til bogens specielle del  naar der  overhovedet lader sig opstille nogenlunde almengyldige regler for et saa  uensartet plantesamfund som stauderne  er det fordi en plante i reglen  kun optages til almindelig kultur  og kun gaelder for en god staude  naar  den ikke er kraesen  men tager til takke og trives under forskellige  forhold     der er i almindelighed ikke tale om at vaelge saerlig gode pladser eller  saerlig jordbund til dyrkningen af stauder  stedet og forholdene er jo  gerne givne  i de smaa haver er der i hvert fald sjaeldent meget at vaelge  imellem  hvis der endelig er et valg at traeffe  er det gerne mellem sol  og skygge  og man bor da undgaa det sidste  thi selv om der findes en  antagelig raekke stauder  der taaler skygge eller halvskygge  saa opnaar  man dog aldrig noget smukt resultat uden solens kraftige hjaelp  i det  mindste det meste af dagen  at der i middagstimerne glider en skygge  over stauderabatten  er naermest af det gode  da det i hoj

regnen lober lige gennem den  kan den forbedres og bringes til at  holde paa fugtigheden  dels ved tilforsel af svaerere jord eller af  godning og da navnlig kogodning og dels ved iblanding af

den dybdebehandling af jorden  der anses som selvfolgelig ved en  vinrabat  vil forekomme mange selv ret havekyndige mennesker aldeles  urimelig  naar det drejer sig om en stauderabat  men mange af stauderne   tilmed af de bedste  som delphinium  phlox  helenium m m   er saa  graadige planter  som der overhovedet findes i kultur  og lige saa lidt  som man hoster gode og smukke druer paa en

arealenheds ydeaevne  er meget storre end ved  andre kulturer  og det er derfor kun rimeligt  at rabatten godes og  dybbehandles i et omfang  der staar i forhold til den kraftanstraengelse   man forlanger af den paagaeldende jordstrimmel  m      a     er en  passende dybde  idet man dels derved skaffer plads til tilstraekkelige  maengder naeringsstoffer og dels foranlediger rodderne til at soge dybt   et forhold  der har den allerstorste vaerdi i sommerens torkeperioder  en  vaerdi  som kun vanskeligt  hvis overhovedet  kan erstattes ved  besvaerlige vandinger      illustration  fig

 et saadant kan bestaa af slagger  murbrokker   afharpning fra kompostbunken eller lignende     ved plantningen af unge planter  navnlig om foraaret  vil det vaere til  stor gavn at iblande jorden

med begaerlighed borer sig ind i  maa dog anvendes uden  overdrivelse  idet dens virkning senere hen formenes at vaere uheldig for  planternes vaekst  der let bliver for blod og los     hvorvidt man lettest fremstiller rabatten ved reolgravning med et par  spadestik  en opskovling og en omgravning af bunden og under dette  arbejde soger at iblande de gjodskende stoffer  eller den lettest

sagens natur  men man kan fastslaa en tid  som for det store flertals  vedkommende er  om ikke den bedste  saa dog god plantetid  det er  september maaned  saa er nemlig sommertorken forbi  og de korte dages  sol formaar ikke at skade de nyplantede planter  medens jorden og luften  dog endnu er tilstraekkelig varm til  at navnlig roddannelsen kan gaa for  sig  de stauder  der daarligst lader sig plante paa denne tid er dels  de  der blomstrer allertidligst om foraaret og de der  som saa mange  smaa stenhojsplanter  lider af fugtighed om vinteren paa svaerere jord   de sildige  d v s  de oktoberblomstrende  lider en del under  plantningen  og selvfolgelig gaar det paagaeldende aars blomstring jo  tabt  det er nodvendigt at fastsaette et saadant faelles tidspunkt  idet  man jo af praktiske grunde ikke ved tilplantningen af en rabat kan  efterkomme de enkelte arters meget forskellige krav i den retning  hvis  man  hvor det drejer sig om plantning af en enkelt eller et par arter   er i stand til at rette sig efter planternes natur  saa gaelder den  almindelige regel  at de foraars og sommerblomstrende stauder bedst  plantes et par uger efter afblomstringen  og de efteraarsblomstrende  bedst lige naar vegetationen begynder  i reglen i april maaned  der er  jo ofte mange hensyn at tage  der gor  at man ikke kan plante til de  ovenfor angivne tider  men heldigvis er det i virkeligheden ogsaa muligt  at flytte og plante stauder naesten hele aaret med undtagelse af de  hindringer  som frost og staerk torke laegger i vejen  navnlig naar  planterne ikke skal underkastes en forsendelse  men kun skal flyttes  indenfor samme have  er man i virkeligheden meget mere frit stillet med  valg af plantetid for stauder  end tilfaeldet er med andre planter  kun  maa

delingen maa antages at ville give en snes  saadanne skud  saa vil de tre enkelte skud i lobet af et eller to aar  danne en blok storre og kraftigere end den store moderplante  hvis denne  samtidig plantes udelt  vil man hurtigt have store  fyldige planter  kan  man opnaa dette ved at plante flere smaadele naer hverandre  men med  ti straekkelig jord imellem  saaledes at de smaa skud kan fore deres  selvstaendige tilvaerelse og sende rodder til alle sider  det er nemlig  dette  som navnlig alle de indre skud i den store blok ikke formaar  og  derfor vokser de saa slet  de bedste planter er

midten af forrige aarhundrede      efterat haugeeieren om foraaret har truffet overenskomst med en eller  anden af de saakaldte gartnere  der paatage sig pasning af saadanne  mindre hauger  blandt hvilke der vistnok findes flere dygtige og  samvittighedsfulde maend  men ogsaa en maengde  som paatage sig noget   hvortil de ikke have ringeste kjendskab  og vor erfaring synes desto  vaerre at vidne om  at haugeeierne  til liden baade for dem selv  ere  meest tilboielige til at vaelge imellem disse  fordi de kunne spare et  par rigsdaler aarlig  giver denne sig  saa saare jorden er nogenlunde  tjenlig  i faerd med at grave rabatterne eller bedene og det ret dybt og  med en spade og lige taet ind til planterne deri  thi han vil jo gjerne  gjore eieren tilpas og skaffe ham hans hauge i tilsyneladende pyntelig  stand saa tidlig som mulig  men i det tidlige foraar ere mange af  planterne endnu ikke komne frem over jorden  hvor ofte seer man derfor  ikke en saadan raa arbejder med spaden gjennemskjaere mange praegtige  planter isaer af logvaexterne og derved aldeles odelaegge dem  medens han  ved sin utidige gravning berover andre planter saa godt som alle de unge  kraftigste rodder og skud  vi bor derfor paa det indstaendigste anbefale  saadanne haugeeiere aldeles at forbyde brugen af spade paa de steder i  haugen  hvor der staaer stauder  og kun lade greben anvende med  forsigtighed og forst naar planterne har viist sig tilstraekkelig over  jorden  hvis de ikke ere forsynede med navnepind  eller dog i det  mindste en nedstukken stok antyder deres plads

sig pille ud igen     naar der  vandes   skal der vandes saa det bloder igennem  det ved  enhver  der har haft lidt med planter at gore  en lille overbrusning kan  maaske nok gavne planterne  men lader jo jordens og roddernes tilstand  vaere uforandret og gor maaske den skade  at der  hvor der ikke ligger  gammel godning mellem planterne  danner sig en skorpe paa jorden  der  fremmer fordampningen  naar det ikke netop drejer sig om ganske smaa  forhold  bor man straebe efter at faa indrettet trykvand  saaledes at man  kan vande med slange  en      rorledning  der ofte kan

rigeligt med godning mellem planterne og maa  saerlig hvis jorden er af  let og tor beskaffenhed  udskyde nogle af de torstigste stauder af sit  sortiment og i stedet optage nogle af de mange stauder

det er ojensynligt  at man paa  torre  sandede steder her i landet  for eks  ved skagen  hvor luften dog  er langt mere fugtig end i brandenburg  alt for ofte enten opgiver aevred  eller ogsaa med overdrevne bekostninger holder liv i de konventionelle  haveplanter uden at prove de mange torketaalende planter  der dog  findes     nogle stauder taaler naesten ikke animalsk  godning   saaledes mange  alpeplanter  og forfatteren har en formodning om  at grunden til at  lilier saa ofte slaar fejl  skyldes  at disse planter ofte ikke kan  taale navnlig frisk  animalsk godning  det store graadige flertal af  stauderne griber og konsumerer alt  hvad der bydes dem  og naar  stauderne plantes taet  som de i reglen bor  maa der laegges megen godning  paa et forholdsvis lille areal  naar det ikke drejer sig om nyplantede  stauder  kan man med stort udbytte anvende kunstgodning  de stoffer  der  kan blive tale om  er kalk     pct  superfosfat     pct  kali og  chilisalpeter     de tre forstnaevnte virker ret langsomt og skal derfor udbringes om  vinteren  kalk og superfosfat ikke samtidigt  chilisalpeter virker i  lobet af faa dage og maa ikke udbringes  for man mener planterne i

arbejder  der melder sig i sommerens lob ved staudernes  pasning  er  opbindingen  et af dem der tager mest tid  men som maa  gores  om man ellers skal have noget smukt ud af sine planter  hvis man  absolut vil befries for dette arbejde  kan der ganske vist sammensaettes  en lang liste af stauder  der ikke kraever opbinding  men saa maa man  rigtignok ogsaa give afkald paa en hel raekke af de

den ikke virker for fremtraedende  man bor saaledes  saette stokkene bag planterne og bor anvende de faerrest mulige  ved selve  opbindingsmaterialet er der ikke noget grimt  det haeslige syn af  opbundne stauder skyldes i reglen  at opbindingen ikke underordner sig  planternes vaekst  men paatvinger planten en unaturlig form  den  naturlige silhuet  konturerne  eller hvad man vil kalde det

i en lille  sirlig  have med fint holdte plaener og smalle rabatter er forholdet noget andet  end i en stor have med en anden karakter og med vidtloftige plantninger   forholdet er ogsaa meget

hvorfor staudeplantninger mislykkes  er at dette  beskaeringsarbejde  der ved rosenkultur anses som selvfolgeligt   forsommes ved stauderne  naar nedskaeringen passes  forynges planterne  fra roden

andre planter  idet det netop er disse  udlobere  der giver de bedste blomster  og en regelmaessig afstikning vil  altsaa direkte modarbejde bestraebelserne for at faa den bedst mulige  blomstring  overfor saadanne planter er en omplantning hvert eller hvert  andet aar naesten det eneste middel til at holde dem paa plads  det  bruges at saette skiferstykker vertikalt ned i jorden for paa den maade  at begraense udlobernes vagabonderen  det hjaelper dog kun delvist  og  saadanne planter egner sig bedst til naturlig plantning  hvor de kan faa  lov til at brede sig  som de vil  og netop paa grund af denne deres  vaestejendommelighed hurtigt kan give indtryk af at vaere vildtvoksende      illustration  fig      delphinium hybr   lys  fyldt var  med morkt  oje      den periodiske omplantning er for mange af vore bedste planter ganske  uomgaaelig  for at de kan yde store og gode blomster  saaledes kan  foruden de naevnte phlox  aster  chrysanthemum  delphinium  helenium og  mange andre af de aller smukkeste stauder kun blomstre ulasteligt nogle  ganske faa aar uden omplantning  aarsagen til dette forhold er omtalt  ovenfor  i tilfaelde  hvor stauder i aarenes lob skyder sig op over  jorden  hvilket f  eks  sker med heuchera  saxifraga cordifolia   aurikler o s v  kan jorden hyppes lidt op om planten til erstatning for  en omplantning  for hyppigheden af disse omplantninger spiller jordens  bonitet og godningskraft en stor rolle  hvis jorden er let og der ikke  gives godningstilskud indtraeffer tilbagegangen hurtigere end under  modsatte forhold  til gengaeld arbejder udloberne naturligvis staerkere i  en naeringsholdig rabat  det er dog saerligt de enkelte arters forskellige  krav  der gor tidsrummet mellem de periodiske omplantninger vekslende   nogle stauder  som helleborus staar en menneskealder eller mere  for de  synligt har kulmineret  andre som asters gaar tilbage allerede andet  aar  atter andre som delphinium gaar forst synligt

generalregel paa dette omraade er ikke saa  stort  som man skulde tro  idet man jo let kan erkende tilbagegangen ved  de talrigere og mindre anselige blomster  ved omplantning af store  rabatter er det en ualmindelig fordel  hvis den er sammensat af planter   der blomstrer og afblomstrer nogenlunde samtidigt og ligeledes  kulminerer samtidigt      illustration  kgl  danske haveselskab  fig

ved denne formeringsmaade er at man paa en gang  kan opnaa en staerk formering  d v s  faa mange planter af et eksemplar   men dette har jo i reglen kun interesse for gartneren  de ofte  mangfoldige

er saerdeles let  er den vanskeligste for amatoren  idet den  kraever drivhus eller mistbaenke  hvor luften kan holdes  sluttet  et par  dage om de nystukne stiklinger  da de planter  der som phlox

fore tilsvarende  lister  naar man forkorter  kan man betegne slaegts og artsnavnet med  begyndelsesbogstavet  hvorimod varietetsnavnet helst maa skrives helt  ud  det vil nemlig altid vaere lettere

laegger for dagen  overfor den latinske  navngivning  var det en naerliggende tanke at samle  saa mange danske navne som muligt  forholdet er jo det  at hvad der  kraeves i havebruget er en varebetegnelse og hertil er den videnskabelige  botaniske nomenklatur kun lidet egnet  den danske flora er fuldt benaevnt  med et saet danske videnskabeligt anerkendte navne  anderledes med  havebrugets planter  der naesten alle stammer fra andre steder  kun faa  af dem har danske folkelige navne  der er saa udbredte  at de tor  anerkendes  en direkte overforing af den danske floras slaegtsnavne til  de slaegter af haveplanter  der er repraesenteret i denne  er ofte  upraktisk som populaer betegnelse  idet de danske arter ofte kun i ringe  grad minder om de udenlandske  kunstigt at danne et saet havenavne er  naturligvis en ufremkommelig vej  det eneste rigtige er vist  efterhaanden som saadanne havenavne dannes  da at faa dem og deres  betydning slaaet fast  i england  hvor den store befolkning er mere  interesseret i blomsterdyrkning end her  og i tyskland hvor evnen og  vilje til at erstatte fremmede ord med tyske er stor  har man langt  flere havenavne end vi har  og der skrives paa begge sprog amator boger  med udelukkende anvendelse af folkelige navne  dog maerker man ulemperne  og usikkerheden  idet det latinske navn gerne maa tilfojes  i handelen  anvendes aldrig andet end den latinske nomenklatur  vi er herhjennne paa  vej til at faa en del havenavne gerne afledet fra latinen  saaledes er  reseda bedre kendt end navnet vav  der er den danske floras slaegtsnavn  for reseda  ligeledes er anemone bedre kendt end simmer o s v  det  forsoges ofte at indfore tyske navne ved f  eks  for phlox at skrive  flammeblomst  flammenblume   saa er det latinske

naar forholdene er saaledes  vil man forstaa  at forf  helt har maattet  se bort fra onsket om at yde et bidrag til en foroget anvendelse af  danske havenavne  men har holdt sig paa det torre d v s  til den ikke  saerlig morsomme  men solide og velprovede latinske nomenklatur  kun med  tilfojelse af enkelte anvendelige danske navne  faatalligheden af danske  haveboger foroger jo ansvaret i hoj grad ved at forsomme lejligheden til  at slaa danske navne fast  men ogsaa ved gennem mislykkede forsog at oge  forvirringen  og forf  vil vaere tilfreds med at undgaa  at ogsaa denne  lille bog

danske havepublikum  foruden med de latinske navne med et helt saet andre fremmede navne  der  er i de senere aar endogsaa begyndt at dukke ungarske  slaviske og  japanske navne op  saa fremtiden ser jo lidt broget ud  havebruget  traenger til en ny linne til at ordne benaevnelsen af det uhyre antal  haveplanter  der hvert aar sendes paa markedet  forelobigt er der dog  ikke andet at gore  end at

book is to remind english speaking people all over  the empire and our allies in america of the wanton destruction and  unspeakable terror which have overwhelmed the regions of france and  belgium occupied by the boche  and also to quicken a true perception of  the reparation and punishment due when peace is made with the enemy  in  many minds time has dimmed the horrors of august and september        when war weariness is apt to sap resolution and the possibility of a  patched up peace is furtively canvassed  the great world of the  english speaking race should call to remembrance the inhuman and barely  credible acts of brutality and bestiality committed in cold blood by the  german race     no apology is made for this book  it is a translation of a document  which has created a profound impression in france  it is an  authoritative record of german crimes committed on the people of belgium  and northern france  attested by the mayors of twenty six french towns   some time ago permission was obtained from the french committee of  publication  the prefect of meurthe and moselle  and the mayors of nancy  and luneville  to produce an english version on condition that the  translation be an  exact and literal translation   this has been  completed and the editor  the rev  j  esslemont adams  an assistant  principal chaplain with the british expeditionary force in france  is  indebted to the friends who have assisted in producing the work           introduction      this is a book of horrors  but a book of plain truths  where have we  discovered our facts  they are taken from three sources   first   four  reports issued by the french commission of enquiry     and  germany s  violation of the laws of warfare   published by the french ministry of  foreign affairs   second   two volumes containing twenty two reports of  the belgian commission     and the reply to the german white book of the    th may         third   notebooks found upon a large number of german  soldiers  non commissioned officers  and officers  who have been wounded  or taken prisoners  and translated under the direction of the french  government  these valuable records  in which the bandits and their  leaders have imprudently given themselves away  are real   pieces a  conviction       these reports in their entirety form an overwhelming indictment  we  wish that everyone could study them in full  but the books are large   running to thousands of pages  and will not find their way to the  general public     yet everyone ought to know how the germans carry on war  we have  therefore made selections from these documents in order to compile this  small pamphlet  a dismal task  this wading through mud and blood  and a  hard task  to run through all these reports  pencil in hand  with the  idea of underlining  the essential facts   you find yourself noting down  each page  marking each paragraph  and  lo and behold  at the end of the  book  you have selected  everything     that is to say  nothing  one  might as well start to gather the hundred finest among the leaves of a  forest  or to pick up the hundred most glittering grains among the sand  on a beach  all we can do is to take the first examples which come to  hand  this  then  is not a collection of the most stirring and striking  german crimes  but simply a book of samples  until complete statistics  are forthcoming  two classes of outrage stand out  and must remain ever  present to the mind  murdered civilians can be counted in thousands   houses wilfully burned  in tens of thousands     for want of time and space we have concerned ourselves here only with  crimes committed in belgium and france  and we have had no thought of  separating the two neighbouring sister nations     our part in this work is a modest one  taking at random a certain number  of  facts   we have grouped them under different headings to make  perusal easier for the reader  to indicate the references would have  been impossible  each line would have required a foot note  the notes  would have been as long as the text  and both the length of  and the  cost of producing this pamphlet would have been doubled     it is enough to state that there is not a single fact published here  that cannot be verified by our readers in one or other of the documents  already referred to  nothing but facts are set down  absolute bare  facts  and it is for the reader to form his own conclusions  when he has  studied these  samples   and begins by means of them to learn the truth   then  and only then  will he have the right to choose  according to his  conscience  between remembrance and oblivion  between pardon and  punishment     l  mirman  prefect of meurthe et moselle     g  simon  mayor of nancy     g  keller

we shall not waste time over the looting of cellars  of larders  of  poultry yards  of linen chests  or of whatever can be consumed promptly   or immediately made use of by the troops  all these are the merest  trifles  let us also dismiss pillage  organised on a large scale by the  authorities  of all sorts of raw material and industrial machinery  the  bill on this score will come to several thousand million francs  let us  likewise put aside official robberies  committed by governors of towns   or provinces  from municipal treasuries  even the treasury of the red  cross at brussels was robbed   usually under the form of fines  or of  taxes imposed under transparent pretences  there again there will be  millions to recover     we shall deal here with  personal robberies  only  as distinct from the  pilfering carried on by hungry soldiers  distinct too from the regular  contributions levied on a conquered country by an unscrupulous  administration  these robberies are innumerable  committed sometimes by  private soldiers  but often by officers  doctors  and high officials   here are some examples          soldier thieves   they are rougher in their dealings  and kill  those who offer resistance  it is a case of  your money or your life    madame maupoix  aged     living at triaucourt  was kicked to death while  soldiers ransacked her cupboards  monsieur dalissier  aged      belonging to congis  was summoned to give up his purse  he declared  that he had no money  they tied him up with a rope and fired fifteen  shots into his body  let us pass quickly over the  soldier  thief   merely small fry          officer thieves   at baron  an officer compelled the notary to open  his safe  and stole money and jewellery from it  another  after going  through several houses  was seen wearing on his wrists and fingers six  bracelets and nine rings belonging to women  soldiers who brought their  officer a stolen jewel received a reward of four shillings  the  robberies at baccarat and creil were  directed  by officers  at creil  a  captain tried to induce guillot and demonts to point out the houses of  the richest inhabitants  and their refusal cost them harsh treatment  at  fosse  a french military doctor in charge of an ambulance  conveying two  hundred patients  and himself wounded  was arrested and taken before a  captain  the captain told the doctor that he would have him shot  and  meanwhile opened the doctor s tunic with his own hand  took out his  pocket book and appropriated the     francs he found in it     officers and privates sometimes share the stolen money  from a diary  belonging to a titled lieutenant of the guards  let us quote this  note            fosse  village entirely burnt  the  th company made           francs

thus                francs for the first lieutenant      francs for the      second lieutenant  etc              doctor thieves   at choisy au bac  two army doctors  wearing their  brassards  personally sacked the house of a family named binder  at  chateau thierry some doctors were made prisoners  their mess tins were  opened and found to be full of stolen articles  after morhange  a french  doctor of the   th corps remained in the german lines to be near his  wounded  he was accosted by one of his german  confreres      who with  his own hands stole his watch and pocket book     at raon sur plaine  after the retreat of our troops  dr  schneider  remained behind with thirty wounded  next day up came a german ambulance  with professor vulpius  a well known german scientist of heidelberg  university  who must have presided over many international medical  congresses  as soon as he was installed   herr professor  intimated to  his french fellow doctors that he was  going to begin with a small  customary formality   the formality was a simple one  his colleagues  were to hand over to him  all the money they had on them    i strongly  protested   declared the french doctor  on oath    but we were compelled  to hand over our purses and all their contents  having relieved us in  this way  he turned to our poor wounded  who were all searched and  stripped of their money  there was nothing to be done  we were in the  hands  not of a doctor  but of a regular brute              royal thieves   after living about a week in a chateau near liege   h r h  prince eitel fritz  the duke of brunswick  and another nobleman  of less importance  had all the dresses that could be found in the  wardrobes belonging to the lady of the house and her daughters packed up  before their own eyes  and sent to germany                                                 these thieves are often  facetious   they give as compensation a  so called receipt or bond  in german  of course   which in french means    good for a hundred lashes   or  good for two rabbits   or  to be shot    or  payable in paris      they are also  disgusting   in houses robbed  by them they leave  by way of visiting cards  excrement in beds  on  tables  and in cupboards  they are sometimes  unnaturally vicious   in a  village of limbourg they burnt in a stable a stallion valued at         francs  and  forced the farmer  his wife and children to witness the  crime on their knees with their arms raised   amongst the crowd of  unfortunate people brought from louvain to brussels were thirteen  priests  the soldiers at a german guard house stopped the column  and  ordered the priests to come out  to shoot them  no  they forced them  into a pigsty  from which they had driven out the only pig  forthwith  they compelled most of them to strip off all their clothes  and robbed  them of everything of value they possessed     these thieves are  practical  too  at dinant  safes were opened with  oxy hydrogen blow pipes  brought expressly for that purpose  they have a  partiality for safes  and in this connection the story of luneville  deserves recording  a house near the station  belonging to m  leclerc   was set on fire  the walls alone remained standing  and in one of them   on the second floor  a safe was left intact  a non commissioned  officer  named weill  with a party blew up the wall with dynamite  and  the safe was extricated from the rubbish  carried to the station  put on  a truck  and sent to boche land  this man weill  before the war  often  came to luneville on business with hops  was always well received there   made himself agreeable and knew everybody  when the germans settled in  the unfortunate town he played a very important part  in spite of his  low rank  in acting as agent  confidential clerk and guide to the  commanding officer     the robbers are also business like in their transport arrangements as to  carriages  military waggons  lorries  and motor cars  at compiegne   where the home of the orsetti family was sacked  silver plate  jewellery  and articles of value were collected in the courtyard of the chateau   then classified  registered  packed and  put into two carts  upon which  they took care to place the red cross flag   we read in the note book of  a wounded german soldier  under medical treatment at brussels   a car  has arrived at the hospital  bringing war booty  a piano  two sewing  machines and all sorts of other things      in       our clocks were in most demand  now  pianos form the  attraction  and an immense number

however  are not all as patient in waiting as elsa  they  frequently come and choose for themselves  and preside over the packing   they have been seen arriving in motor cars from strasbourg or metz  at  many towns in lorraine  at luneville  baccarat  and elsewhere     all note books  more or less  contain such items as these   wholesale  pillage and abundant loot    everything destroyed or sacked

require to be told twice   whole bales of loot        rethel   the vandals could not have done better    the officer who  makes this indiscreet admission and seems to protest against the thefts  committed  writes on the following page   i have found a silk rainproof  coat and a camera for felix         courcy   the village  and the workmen s cottages looted and sacked   atrocious  there is something  after all  in what they say of german  barbarians        ottignies   the village was pillaged  the blond beast has made plain  what he is  the huns and the free lances of the middle ages could not  have done better        cirey   during the night incredible things were done  shops sacked   money stolen  rapes  enough to make one s hair stand on end        footnotes         we have not found this fact recorded in the commission s reports  it  was told to us  on his return from captivity  by dr  marlier  of the    th corps  taken prisoner at morhange  and dr  marlier is the soul of  honour           incendiarism      in order to punish imaginary crimes  attributed to individuals or  townships  or without even taking the trouble to discover any kind of  pretext  the germans often  especially after looting  set everything on  fire  so as to make all traces disappear   sometimes  as at courtacon   they compelled the inhabitants to provide the material for burning their  own houses  or  as at recquignies  forced prisoners  to set the houses  of the doctor and mayor on fire with lighted straw   but generally they  do the work themselves  they have a  special service  for this  and all  the requisite incendiary material is carefully prepared  torches   grenades  fuses  oil pumps  firebrands  satchels of pastilles containing  very inflammable compressed powder  etc  german science has applied  itself to the perfecting of the technique of incendiarism  the village  is set alight by a  drilled  method  those concerned act quite coolly   as a matter of duty  as though in accordance with a drill scheme laid  down and perfected beforehand     of course  fire once let loose  these people have to see that it does  its work completely  accordingly  at louvain  they destroyed the  fire engines and fire escapes  at namur  they stopped the firemen at the  very moment they were preparing to do their duty     in this way they sometimes wilfully burned down whole blocks of  dwellings  luneville   sometimes an entire district      houses at  senlis      at baccarat   sometimes almost a whole town itself  more  than     houses at gerbeviller      at sermaize        at dinant         at louvain      on other occasions they did not leave a house standing   nomeny  clermont en argonne  sommeilles      the complete list of buildings  cottages  farms  villas

witness the sight of the conflagration holding their hands up  their  torture lasted six hours   at crevic  the germans began their sinister  work by burning a chateau which they knew belonged to general lyautey   the troops  commanded by an officer  shouted out for madame and  mademoiselle lyautey  that they might cut their heads off      the houses destroyed by fire were not always uninhabited  at maixe  m   demange  wounded in both knees  dragged himself along and fell prostrate  in his kitchen  his house was set on fire and madame demange was  forcibly prevented from going to the rescue of her husband  who perished  in the flames  at nomeny  madame cousin  after being shot  was thrown  into the burning building and roasted  at the same place  m  adam was  thrown alive into the flames  let us note in connection with him  to  their credit  an act of comparative humanity  finding that the unhappy  man was not being burnt fast enough  they ended his misery in the flames  by shooting him  at monceau sur sambre  where they set fire to      houses  they confined the two brothers s  in a shed  and the unfortunate  men were burnt alive        the soldiers  diaries are filled with descriptions of incendiarism  some  of which we now quote   returned by mazerulles  which was burnt as we  passed through  because the engineers found a telephone there connected  up with the french       the whole village was in ablaze  everything  destroyed in the street  except one small house  in front of the door  was a poor woman with her six children  her arms raised and begging for

have some value  anyone trying to escape was shot  everything in  the village was destroyed   we shall see presently that they even went  so far as to burn ambulances       footnotes         they

the crimes committed  from a distance   so to speak  on  unfortified towns  with fieldpieces  long range guns  aeroplanes  and  zeppelins  merely noting that the germans  were the first  to fire  shells into the centre of towns indiscriminately  if they made an  exception  it was to aim at the cathedral square  when people were  leaving after mass  as at nancy  or into the market place at the time  when women are busiest  as they did at luneville     we only mention here such outrages as were committed at close quarters  with hand weapons  bayonets or rifles  the list is a long one  will the  exact number of victims ever be known  in belgium alone it has been  proved that up to now more than       civilians have been assassinated   grown men  old people  women and children  they slaughtered their  victims sometimes one by one  sometimes in groups  often in masses  they  were not content only with killing  at one place they organised round  the massacre such tragic scenes  and at another displayed such  refinements of cruelty  that reason falters in face of their acts  and  asks what terrible madness has brought this race to such low depths  is  it possible  yes  it is  judge by the following examples       at foret  the village schoolmaster was shot for refusing to trample  under foot the national flag  torn down from the front of the school      at schaffen  a  willem was tied to a tree and burnt alive  and two other  unfortunate men were buried alive  madame luykx and her little girl      years old  were shot together in a cellar  j  reynders and his young  nephew     years of age  were both shot in the street  at sompuis  an  old man named jacquemin  aged     was bound to his bed by an officer and  left there without food for three days  dying soon after his release     a westphalian prisoner states   the commanding officer ordered us to  shoot two women  and we did so  one of them was holding a child by the  hand  and in falling she dragged the child over with her  the officer  gave orders to shoot the child  because it could not be left alone in  the world   at rouves  a government clerk refused to tell a bavarian  officer the numbers of the french regiments in the neighbourhood  the  officer killed him with two shots from his revolver  at crezancy   another officer shot with his own hand young lesaint     years old   to  prevent his being a soldier later on   at embermenil  madame masson was  shot for having  in absolute good faith  given some wrong information   as she was obviously in a state of pregnancy they made her sit down on a  bench to meet her fate  at ethe  two priests were shot  for having  buried some weapons   at marqueglise  a superior officer ordered the  arrest of four young fugitives  learning that two of them came from  belgium  he exclaimed   the belgians are filthy people   and without  more ado took his revolver and shot them one after the other  three were  killed outright  the fourth expired the following day     from the crowd of fugitives which left louvain in flames  the priests  were singled out  and searched  on one of them  a jesuit father  by name  dupierreux  they found a note book containing the following note in  french   when i used to read about the huns under attila devastating  towns  i smiled  i smile no longer now that i have seen with my own eyes  the hordes of to day setting fire to the churches and library of  louvain   in front of the assembled troops the priests were placed in a  semi circle round the jesuit father  the incriminating phrase was read  out  and then translated into german  the lieutenant said that it  constituted an incitement to murder  and that the jesuit must be shot on  the spot  the sentence was carried out forthwith  and the other  priests  his companions  were made to bury him where he fell     at pin  some uhlans found two young boys on the road  they tied them by  the arms to their horses and galloped off  the bodies of the poor lads  were found a few miles away  their knees were  literally crushed   one  had his throat cut and both had several bullets in their heads  at  sermaize  a labourer  named brocard  and his son  were arrested  his  wife and daughter in law  mad with terror  threw themselves into a  neighbouring stream  the old man broke away  and ran to try and save  them  the germans dragged him away     four days later brocard and the  son  on being liberated  returned home  and after a search  found the  bodies  the two women  while still in the water  had been shot several  times through the head  a parish priest named dergent was taken to  aerschot  stripped  and tied to a cross in front of the church  his  fingers and toes were crushed and broken with the butt end of a rifle   the inhabitants were made to pass in front of him and were each  compelled to urinate on him in turn  then he was shot and his body  thrown into the canal         at herimenil  during the pillage  the inhabitants were shut up in a  church  and kept there for four days without food  when madame winger      years of age  and her three young servants  one girl and two boys   were too slow in leaving her farm to go to the church  the captain  ordered his men to fire on them  four more dead bodies     the germans arrived at monchy humieres  a group of inhabitants watched  them marching past  no provocation whatever was offered  but an officer  thought that he heard someone utter the word  prussians   he at once  called out three dragoons  and ordered them to fire upon the group  one  killed and two wounded  one of the latter being a little girl of four     at sommeilles  when the fire  which destroyed the whole place  broke  out  madame x  took refuge in a cellar belonging to m  and madame adnot   who were there  with their four children  the eldest a girl of    years   a few days after  on returning to the village  our soldiers found the  seven bodies in the cellar lying in a pool of blood  several of them  being horribly mutilated  madame x  had her right arm severed from her  body  the little girl s foot had been cut off  and the little boy of  five had his throat cut     at louveigne a certain number of men were shut up in a blacksmith s  shop  in the afternoon the murderers opened the door as if it were a  pigeon shooting competition  drove the prisoners out  and shot them  down  a ghastly group of    corpses     at senlis the heroic mayor  m  odent  and six members of his staff were  shot     at gerbeviller they forced their way into the house of m  and madame  lingenheld  seized the son  aged     exempt from service  and wearing  the badge of the red cross  tied his hands  dragged him into the street  and shot him  they then returned to look for the father  an old man of      meanwhile the mother  mad with terror  made her escape  on coming  out she saw her son lying on the ground  as he still showed signs of  life  they threw paraffin over him and roasted him  the father was shot  later on with fourteen other old men  more than     victims were  identified in this parish     at nomeny  m  vasse provided shelter for a number of neighbours in his  cellar  fifty soldiers got in and set fire to the house  to escape the  flames the refugees rushed out and were shot one by one as they emerged   mentre was killed first  his son leon  with his little eight year old  sister in his arms  fell next  as he was not quite dead they put the  barrel of a rifle to his ear and blew his brains out  then came the turn  of a family named kieffer  the mother was wounded  the father  his boy  and girl  aged respectively    and    were shot down  they fell on them  with fury  striffler  guillaume  and vasse were afterwards massacred   young mlle  simonin     years old  and her small sister  afraid to leave  their refuge in the cellar  were eventually driven out by the flames   and immediately shot at  the younger child had an elbow almost blown off  by a bullet  as the elder girl lay wounded on the ground  she was  deliberately kicked by a soldier  at nomeny    victims were identified     and now we come to some of the  wholesale slaughters   at louvain  more  than     victims  at aerschot  over      at soumagne       at ethe        at andenne  over      at tamines       at dinant  upwards of      of  whom    were women     old men of over seventy    children from five to  nine years old  and    under five  at aerschot  a first batch of    men  were taken out of the town  and ordered to advance in groups of three   holding each other by the hand  when they were made to pass in front of  some german military police  who shot them all at short range with  revolvers  others had their hands bound so tightly that many screamed  with pain  they spent the night lying on the ground  and were shot the  next day  many  before execution  were compelled to dig their own  graves  at dinant  the victims were placed in two rows  the first  kneeling  the second standing  then came the order   fire   at tamines   several hundred men were massed in the place saint martin  on the bank  of the sambre  the assassins stood ten yards away and fired a volley   all fell  but some were not wounded  the officer in command ordered them  to  stand up   a second volley was fired  as soon as the firing  finished  there was a frightful scene which lasted until the  evening  the killing of the wounded  many soldiers  some wearing the  badge of the red cross  approached their victims by the light of small  lanterns  and passed through their ranks  clubbing them with the butt  end of their rifles  and stabbing with bayonets  a perfect shambles     in these horrors we do not discern the musical note  or the  acknowledgment of the  old german god   yet  here is a specimen       at andenne  colonel schumann  in command of the potsdam rifles   organised a grand concert in the evening at the place des tilleuls  the  entertainment ended with a prayer     it now remains for us to publish a few extracts from note books found  upon officers and privates  some are short items like the  following    pepinster    th august  burgomaster  priest and  schoolmaster shot  and houses burnt to the ground  we resume our march    another   villers en fagne  village in flames  the population had  notified the french of the approach of the grenadiers  thereupon the  hussars set fire to the village  the parish priest and others being  shot      others enter into details of the executions    leffe   we shoot everyone  who fires on our men  we put three  one behind the other  and a marburg  rifleman kills them outright with a single shot  it is war to the  knife      another expresses something other than enthusiasm for such work    considering that the king  of the belgians  has given orders to defend  the country by all possible means  we have been ordered to shoot every  male inhabitant  at dinant more than     were collected in a crowd and  shot  a dreadful sunday   another  an aesthete  writes as follows    during the night many more civilians were shot  so many that we were  able to count over      women and children  with lamps in their hands   were compelled to witness the horrible sight  we afterwards ate our  rice among the dead bodies  sadly beautiful   he adds  in shorthand    captain hermann was drunk      again another    dinant   we have been firing on everyone who showed  himself  or on those thrown out of the houses  men or women  the bodies  lie in the streets  in heaps a yard deep      a saxon officer writes   my company is at bouvignes  our men behave like  vandals  everything is upset  the sight of the slaughtered inhabitants  defies all description  not a house is left standing  we have dragged  out of every corner all survivors  one after another  men  women  and  children  found in a burning cloister  and have shot them  en masse       the following depositions on the massacres at nomeny are made by  prisoners  one a bavarian officer in the reserve  the other a private in  the same regiment  the lieutenant says   i gathered the impression that  it was impossible for the officers at nomeny to prevent such acts  as  far as i can judge  the crimes committed there  which horrified all the  soldiers who were at nomeny later on  must be put down to the acts of  unnatural brutes   the soldier says   at five o clock regimental orders  were received to kill every male inhabitant of nomeny  and to raze  everything to the ground  we forced our way into the houses   here is a  more detailed account of a massacre near blamont   all the villagers  fled  it was terrible  their beards thick with blood  and what faces   they were dreadful to look at  the dead were all buried  numbering  sixty  among them were many old men and women  and one unfortunate woman  half confined  the whole being frightful to look at  three children  were clasped in each other s arms  and had died thus  the altar and the  vaulting of the church were destroyed because there was a telephone      communicating with the enemy  this morning   nd september  all the  survivors were expelled  i saw four small boys carrying away on two  sticks a cradle containing a baby of five or six months  all this is  dreadful to see  blow for blow  thunder against thunder  every thing is  given up to pillage  i also saw a mother with her two children  one had  a big wound on the head  and one eye knocked out        footnotes         they have decorated the pirates who sank the  lusitania   they glory  in the crime  and have even struck a commemorative medal in its honour         in this case  and many of the following ones  the reader is  requested to note  and remember  the  motive  for the murders          this cruel treatment of the abbe dergent  priest of gelrode  near  louvain  is reported by a neutral witness  father g   a student at  louvain  the german soldiers accused the belgian priests of every  conceivable crime  the assistant priest of sainte gertrude  louvain    who was remonstrating with a soldier  received this reply   we are  catholics too  but you are pigs and black devils   in belgium about one  hundred of the clergy were massacred  note further that in this  unfortunate country  doctors  were particularly ill treated   thirty seven being shot in the small parishes  while more than one  hundred and fifty disappeared altogether from large towns          to whom did it belong  and where was it  telephones exist in every  district of meurthe et moselle  besides  our army installed field  telephones which were not all destroyed at the time of their retreat  it  is a most foolish pretext  yet where can one find a more stupid one than  this  a german official communique  in order to prove that the general  rising of the people had been organized for a long time  declares   that  depots of arms were installed  where each rifle bore the name of the man  for whom it was intended   it is absolutely clear that this applies to  arms taken from civilians by order of the local authorities in belgium  and france  and deposited at the town hall  every weapon bearing the  name of its owner  would they have taken that for an arsenal  no  stupid  as they may be  they are not so foolish as that  they feign stupidity  simply because they know very well that the conscience of the civilized  world is beginning to be moved           outrages on women and children      we might write a long and heartbreaking chapter on this pitiful subject   but let the following suffice  the report of the french commission of  enquiry concludes with these words   outrages upon women and young girls  have been common  to an unheard of extent    no doubt the bulk of these  crimes will never come to light  for it needs a concatenation of special  circumstances for such acts to be committed in public  unfortunately and  only too often these circumstances have existed   e g    at  beton bazoches and sancy les provins  a young girl  and at st   denis les rebaix  a mother in law and a little boy of eight years old   and at coulommiers a husband and two children  were witnesses to  outrages committed on the mother of the family  sometimes the attacks  were individual and sometimes committed by bodies of men   e g    at  melen labouxhe  margaret w  was violated by twenty german soldiers  and  then shot by the side of her father and mother  they did not even  respect nuns         they did not even spare grandmothers  louppy le chateau   vitry en perthois          nor did they respect children     at cirey  a witness  a university  professor   whose statements one of us took down a few days after the  tragedy  cried to a bavarian officer   have you no children in germany    all the officer said in reply was   my mother never bore swine like  you      now and then they let themselves loose on a whole family  at louppy  the  mother and her two young girls aged thirteen and eight  respectively   were simultaneous victims of their savagery     the outrages sometimes lasted till death  at nimy  the martyrdom of  little irma g  lasted six hours till death delivered her from her  sufferings  when her father tried to rescue her he was shot  and her  mother was seriously wounded  indeed  it was certain destruction to any  frenzied parent who tried to defend his child  a clergyman of dixmude  says   the burgomaster of handzaeme was shot for trying to protect his  daughter   and how many other cases have occurred  we have not the heart  to continue the list       footnotes          see the report of the french commission  vol  i   page      see  also  in the  reply to the white book   p       the moving letter of  cardinal mercier to von bissing   my conscience forbids my divulging to  any tribunal the information  alas  only too well substantiated  which i  possess  outrages on nuns have been committed               killing the wounded      there are  great numbers  of wounded who  on their solemn oath  have  related how  when lying on the field of battle  they saw their wounded  comrades  finished off  by rifle or revolver shots  or by blows from  butt ends  or by bayonet stabs  or kicked to death by german soldiers   non commissioned officers  and even by officers         we cannot pause to analyse these innumerable depositions  there is other  evidence  how often  when a counter attack has put us in possession of  ground lost the day before  have we found poor fellows  finished  off   with their throats cuts  as in the case of the two sergeants of  the   st chasseurs at the pass of sainte marie  or  with their own  bayonets driven into their mouths   like the poor little fellow of the    th  the enemy often runs amok like this    on august   rd  the cure of  remereville tended lieutenant toussaint  who passed out first at the  forestry school in july   when he fell in battle  this young officer was  bayoneted by all the germans who passed near him  and his body was a  mass of wounds from head to feet   at oudrigny  a german officer met a  french vehicle showing the red cross flag  and loaded with ten wounded   he deployed his company  and fired two volleys at it   at bonviller  an  officer murdered nine french wounded  stretched helpless in a barn  by  shooting them through the ear  on   rd august at montigny le tilleul  m   vital was caught in the act of tending a french soldier  l  sohier by  name  wounded in the head and side  such a crime deserved punishment   and the wretches first shot the orderly and then the patient     at ethe they set a shed on fire and roasted more than twenty wounded who  were lying there     we all know the celebrated order of general stenger in the region of  thiaville  meurthe et moselle     no prisoners are to be taken  all  prisoners  whether wounded or not  must be slaughtered      it was not only in lorraine that such orders were given  listen to the  depositions of a german soldier   the same day we saw eighteen other  frenchmen  lieutenant n  told us to shoot them as he did not know what  else to do with them      read this letter found at l ecouvillon in a german trench which we  recaptured   every day we take many prisoners  but they are shot at once  as we no longer know where to put them      think of the diary in which a german soldier near peronne recorded his  impressions of the day   they lay in heaps of ten or twelve  some dead  and some still living  those who could still walk were marched off   those who were wounded in the head or lungs  and could not lift  themselves up  were finished off with a bullet  that is the order which  we got      a german soldier  while being nursed in a hospital at nancy  confided to  dr  roemer that the wound in his stomach  had been inflicted on him by a  german n c o  because he refused to finish off a wounded frenchman      wounded were not only massacred on the field of battle  but field  hospitals were also the scene of atrocities  at gomery  in a casualty  clearing station  under dr  sedillot  there were numerous wounded  remaining in the german lines  a german officer with twenty five men  visited the place and inspected it and retired  saying that all was in  order  but a n c o  and a party of soldiers remained in the street  outside  they were excited and kept shouting   it is war to the death    and making signs of cutting throats  they rushed in and with their  revolvers shot down dr  sedillot  who happily survived  with others  to  give evidence   and set fire to the place  maddened by the flames  the  wounded  many of whom had had amputations performed on them that very  morning  leapt from the windows on the first floor and fell into the  garden  where the executioners picked them up  gathering them in a  bunch  and shot them  in this way lieutenant jeannin and dr  charette  were murdered  and from one hundred to one hundred and twenty officers  and soldiers  whose wounds should have made them sacred  perished from  shot or fire after terrible sufferings     when all is said  however  it is better to kill wounded soldiers by fire  or sword than by starvation  as the following incident shows  one  hundred wounded frenchmen  together with dr  bender  were brought to the  stenay barracks  and one hundred and eighty more came in shortly  afterwards  the latter  having been left out unattended on the  battle field for five days  were in a terrible condition  dr  bender in  vain begged the germans for help in getting the wounded men out of the  ambulances into the hospital  the boches refused  and simply went on  sucking their pipes  though wounded himself  the doctor  with the aid of  two male nurses  frenchmen both   had to do the whole thing himself   for several days the boches gave them no food at all   our poor fellows  screamed with hunger       says the doctor  on oath  and adds   i had  sixty badly wounded with me  and begged the german army doctor to  operate  but he said he had no time  i then asked his leave to operate  myself  but his reply was   you are in the german lines  and must  conform to our rules   the doctor ends his pathetic evidence with the  words   nearly all these unhappy men died of neglect      we have seen doctors  like professor vulpius  actually steal money  but  of all the types of boche doctors  the most hideous is the hero of the  following tale  taken from the deposition of dr  bender   a french  soldier  at stenay  was under my treatment  he had a wound in his  foot  not very severe  which did not need an operation at all  what was  my astonishment to find that a german army surgeon had amputated his  thigh  i could not help expressing my indignation  and the surgeon s  only reply was   he will be a man the less against us in the next  war       they will deny these crimes to morrow  but in      they  gloried in them     on the   th of october a silesian newspaper published an article sent  from the front by a n c o   in which he says   men who are particularly  tender hearted give the french wounded the  coup de grace  with a  bullet  but the others cut and thrust as much as possible  our enemies  fought bravely     whether they are slightly or badly wounded our brave  fusiliers spare the fatherland as far as possible the expensive trouble  of looking after numerous enemies  in the evening  with prayers of  thanksgiving on our lips  we go to sleep   are these mere boastings of  crimes  no  the article was submitted to the captain of the company who  certified it as correct and counter signed it  the n c o   the captain   the silesian public  the whole german nation were delighted to see this  abominable story of murder and shame appear in the paper under the  heading   a day of honour for our regiment              footnotes          report of the french commission  vol  iii          he adds that certain orderlies  lorrainers  belonging to the german  army  supplied them with food on the sly          french chivalry could hardly believe that a doctor would amputate a  wounded enemy s limb without absolute necessity and in mere revenge  but  such cases are  alas  not rare  see the awful tales of torture in the   journal d un grand blesse en allemagne   by charles hennebois  pp              and the statement of a german doctor  p        your doctors in  france perform amputations as they please on our wounded  the order has  therefore been given to amputate without hesitation  as reprisals  every  damaged limb           let us quote  to show the mental  make up  of certain germans  the  conditions in which captain coustre of the    th and captain lesourd of  the   th met their deaths  they were wandering over the battle field  where the enemy had been repulsed  they heard a cry for help  there was  a soldier in one place and an officer in another who asked for a drink   they stopped and leant over them to give them a drink from their flasks  when the wounded men blew their brains out           sheltering behind women      let us call to mind the innumerable instances when the boches put up  their hands  or waved a white flag  and cried   kamerad   pretending to  surrender  thus drawing our unsuspecting men towards them and then  suddenly moving aside  to leave the field open to a party of riflemen or  a machine gun hidden away behind them  these are the tricks of cowards   which were constantly employed at the beginning of the war  and our men   at the cost of many victims  learned at last to guard against them  but  they have done even more cowardly things than this  there was the german  officer who  to protect himself from danger while taking observations   put three children round him  at nery  twenty five persons  women and  children  were compelled to walk at the side of a boche column to  protect it from being enfiladed  near malines  six german soldiers who  were taking with them five young girls  on meeting a belgian patrol   placed the girls all round them to prevent the enemy from firing  at  jodoigne they put a cure in front of them and made him walk with his  arms folded  and they did the same at hougaerde to another cure who was  killed  a similar fate befell several civilians at mons  at senlis  our  men were firing to cover our retreat  and the germans took some  inhabitants out of the houses and made them walk in the middle of the  streets while they themselves kept along by the walls  many of these  unfortunate people were killed   in numerous places   says the belgian  commission of enquiry   the germans made civilians  men and women  walk  in front of them   in this way a german column passed through  marchienne  pushing ahead of them a body of several hundred civilians   they took the road for montigny le tilleul  where the first important  battle with the french forces took place  at sempst  during the fighting  on the   th august  men and women were placed in the front rank of the  firing line  at erpe  on the   th september  a german column  attacked  by a belgian motor machine gun  took out of the houses twenty to  twenty five men and young people  including a child of thirteen   and  made them walk in front in the middle of the road  the machine gunners   seeing civilians in front of them  ceased firing  at alost  a german  company attacked the bridge  in front marched some thirty civilians with  a machine gun hidden behind them  at nimy  with the butt ends of their  rifles  they drove in front of them     men  women and children towards  the english  who in consequence dared not fire  and in this way the   th  and   th schleswig regiments were able to continue their heroic march as  far as maubeuge     when their adversary cannot actually see the human shield that they are  using  they send a warning  on the  th september        the death s head  hussars shut up all the inhabitants of the village with them in the  chateau of saint ouen sur morin  and then  to avoid being shelled   informed the english of their  dispositions   they fired on anyone who  tried to escape  at mouzon  we saw a number of civilians being pushed in  front of the enemy with the butt ends of rifles  and we stopped firing   the wretched people moved suddenly to one side of the road  uncovering  the germans  and then we fired  the boches  furious  fired their first  volley not at us  but point blank at these non combatants  who were  decimated     the cowards chiefly used civilians as shields  but sometimes they also  made use of prisoners  at keyem  they pushed one hundred belgian  soldiers in front of them  some with their hands tied  and others with  their arms in the air  at dixmude  they advanced under the shelter of  forty disarmed marines who had been taken prisoners  when they got in  front of our lines our marines shouted   for god s sake fire  these are  germans   and these heroes fell gloriously under the french bullets   such deeds are countless     the boches will deny them later on  but in      they did not deny them   but rather gloried in them as a  good idea   we can see this from the  letter of the bavarian lieutenant eberlein  published on the  th  october        by a leading munich paper   we had arrested three other  civilians when a  good idea  struck me  we made them sit on chairs in  the middle of the street   supplications from them  and blows with  butt ends of rifles from us  at last they were seated outside in the  street with their hands convulsively clasped together  i felt sorry for  them  but the plan worked at once  as i learnt later  the regiment which  entered saint die  further to the north of us  had precisely similar  experiences to our own  the civilians  whom they had put in the same  way in the middle of the street  were killed by french bullets  i saw  their dead bodies              footnotes          we have not  so far  come across any attempted justification  by  german authors  of these cowardly acts  but such we shall have without  fail  it is probable that the     intellectuals  whose manifesto we  recall to memory a few pages further on are preparing a fresh  appeal to  the civilized world  with a view to explaining that the german  troops  the representatives and trustees of  kultur   are authorised by  god himself to use  every means  for the protection of their precious  lives           martyrdon of civilian prisoners      after having burnt our villages      and shot the inhabitants by dozens  in some places  and by hundreds in others  they frequently deported all  or a part of the survivors to germany  it is impossible at this moment  to establish the number of those deported  but they were sent off by  tens of thousands  these unfortunate people  men  women and children   who had witnessed and survived fires and massacres  who had seen their  houses blazing and so many of those dear to them fall under the bullets  of the assassin  and who were forced in some places to dig graves for  their victims  and in others to hold a light for the executioners while  they were finishing off the wounded   these poor wretches are despatched  to germany      what a journey  and what a place of residence     let us quote one story among a thousand   our escort was commanded by  two german officers  they were unapproachable  anyone who tried to speak  to them was threatened with a revolver  in order that we might get a  drink  we were made to collect empty meat tins which served as our  drinking cups until we reached cassel  we were abused and threatened  wherever we went  sometimes they made signs to us that they were going  to shoot us  or hang us  or cut our heads off  they threw filth at our  heads and spat in our faces  we were not going to stoop before them  the  disgrace was not ours  it is they  not we  who are degraded  an officer  who was present when our march past took place aimed blows with a  riding whip at everyone within his reach  until we arrived at the  railway  it was the same at every place where we met soldiers  we  reached marche after a nine hours  journey  we were conducted to a room  marked as having accommodation for     soldiers  but they put     of us  in there  the people of the place sent us slices of bread and butter   but it was the germans who ate them  the latter gave us crusts of bread  to eat  we were abominably cramped  a few managed to stretch themselves  out  but the air was so poisonous that they could not remain in that  position  at melreux station we changed guards  they drove us with the  butt ends of their rifles to a spot where a train of cattle trucks was  standing in the yard  and we had to get in  the previous occupants had  been cattle  and the trucks had been cleaned in a very perfunctory  fashion  there was neither straw nor seats  off we went  every time we  stopped at a station the soldiers on guard there insulted us  it was  even worse when once we arrived in germany  they opened the doors on the  platform side  and if we were on a line between two platforms  they  opened the doors on both sides so as to rejoice german hearts by the  sight of us  they treated us like wild beasts in a menagerie  and the  officers and soldiers set the example while the women and children were  not behindhand with abuse  and made threatening gestures  our guards  were applauded as if they were doing something heroic  at one station we  saw a woman looking out of her window and shouting  hurrah   the journey  took    hours  and during the whole of that time we were only given food  and drink once  and that thanks only to the red cross      we arrived at  wilhelmshoehe  cassel  at   a m  on the   th august  and were made to  walk quickly through the streets  our arrival had been notified  and in  spite of the early hour  a hostile crowd  abusive and threatening  lined  the route  the old and the lame could not keep up the pace at which we  marched  their companions helped and dragged them along  constantly  beaten with butt ends  at length  we arrived at the gaol  where they  shut us in the cells in lots of three or four at a time  m  brichet   inspector of forests  wanted to take his son  aged     with him  but  the gaoler said   not the father and son together   the prison  authorities showed their surprise at the sort of criminals who had been  entrusted to them  as the bulk of them were shopkeepers and artisans      included in the number were the burgomaster of dinant  a sheriff   professors  barristers  and judges  an imbecile  a dozen children of  about     and some old men  one of whom was     made up the party  at  the end of a week  we were assembled in a yard and told that we were not  under sentence  but were detained in the interests of public safety      in that prison the poor wretches were treated with much greater severity  than ordinary prisoners  for they were shut up in cells and had no air    by climbing on a chest one might open the window and see a little bit  of the landscape  the ordinary prisoners were allowed to do this but we  were forbidden   there was not a single chair  there was the skeleton of  an iron bed which was quite useless as there was no mattress  there were  four blankets  and two bundles of straw which very soon crumbled into  dust   one day a week we had an hour in the courtyard  and there we  walked round and round in single file  being forbidden to walk two by  two  there was a guard with fixed bayonets always with us  the food was  absolutely inadequate     and we suffered continually from hunger  there  was a certain croibien who had been slightly wounded at dinant by a  bullet in his arm  his wound  neglected during the journey  had become  septic and in spite of all his sufferings  nothing was done for him  it  was not until after several days that it was decided to take him to the  infirmary where his arm was amputated  he died the next day  although  his father and brothers were interned with him  they were not allowed to  see him again  alive or dead      m  tschoffen  public prosecutor at dinant  the high official who writes  these lines  finishes his deposition with these words   they had no  reason whatever for our arrest  and i do not see any reason that they  could have for setting us at liberty  one fine day they told us that we  were going to leave      here is another illustration  before the   th february        more than         persons  old men  women  and children  who had been deported from  france to germany  had been repatriated by way of switzerland  all those  who received them on their return were  alarmed at their ragged  condition and weakness   which was so great that the french commission  of enquiry received special instructions to question these victims  they  took the evidence of over     witnesses in    different localities  to  do justice to their case one ought to quote the whole report  children  brutally torn away from their mothers  poor wretches crowded for days  together in carriages so tightly packed that they had to stand up  cases  of madness occurring among these half stifled crowds  howling with  hunger  but we must confine our quotations to a few items of  kultur     while the men of combres set out for germany  the women and children  were shut up in the village church  they were kept there for a month   and passed their nights seated in the pews  dysentery and croup raged  among them  the women were allowed to carry excrement only just outside  the church into the churchyard     at least four of the prisoners were  massacred because they could not keep up with  the column  being  completely exhausted     fortin  aged     and infirm  could not go any  further  they tied a rope to him  and two horsemen held the ends so that  he had to keep the pace of the horses  as he kept falling down at every  moment  they made him get up by poking him with their lances  the poor  wretch  covered with blood  prayed them to kill him           inhabitants of sinceny  who were sent to erfurt  arrived there  after a journey of    hours  during which each of them got nothing but a  single morsel of bread weighing less than four ounces  another convoy  spent four days on the railway journey and were only fed once  and were  beaten with sticks and fists and with knife handles   the same  brutalities were experienced in the german cities through which they  passed  and very few of the civilian prisoners escaped being buffeted by  the infuriated crowds or being spat upon     so much for the journey  now for what happened to them after their  arrival   the declarations made to us show clearly that the bulk of the  prisoners almost collapsed from hunger  after food had been distributed   when anything was left  you saw some of them rush to the neighbourhood  of the kitchens  hustled and beaten by the sentries  these unfortunates  risked blows and abuse to try and pick up some additional morsels of  the sickening food  you saw men  dying of hunger  picking up herring  heads  and the grounds of the morning s decoction      at parchim  where       french civilians from    to    years of age were  interned  two starving prisoners who asked for the scraps left over were  beaten with the butt ends of rifles to such an extent that they died of  their wounds  the young son of one of them who tried to protect his  father was tied to a stake for a week on end     on oath  dr  page deposes   those who had no money almost died of  hunger  when a little soup was left  a crowd of unfortunates rushed to  get it  and the non commissioned officers got rid of them at last by  letting the dogs loose on them   but what is the need of all these  details and of all this evidence  look at the        who came back after  being repatriated and see what the bandits have done to them  reader   summon up your courage and peruse to the bitter end the conclusions of  the official commission of enquiry   it is impossible to conceal the  melancholy and indignation we felt on seeing the state of the   hostages      whom the germans had returned to us after they had  kidnapped them in defiance of the rights of nations  during our enquiry  we never ceased hearing the perpetual coughs that rent them  we saw  numbers of young people whose cheerfulness had disappeared apparently  for ever  and whose pale and emaciated faces betrayed physical damage  probably beyond repair  in spite of ourselves we could not help thinking  that scientific germany had applied her methodical ways to try and  spread tuberculosis in our country  nor were we less profoundly moved to  thought by the sight of women mourning their desolated hearths and  missing or captive children  or by the moral impression left on the  faces and bearing of many prisoners by the hateful regime which was  intended to destroy  in those who were subjected to it  the feeling of  human dignity and self respect              footnotes           prisoners   as well as wounded  have very often been massacred on  the field of battle  as to the treatment that prisoners  french   belgian  russian and english  have undergone in german camps  it is a  pitiful tale that we do not intend to begin here  some day it must be  written  with the actual evidence before us  the lot of the german  prisoners in england  russia and france must be compared with that of  ours in germany  the most indifferent reader will feel his heart stirred  within him  and will hesitate to say whether we were  generous   or  whether we were  fools           we speak of those who have left  but what of those who have  remained in belgium and france  under the german heel  the time has not  yet come for writing this piece of history  but we cannot refrain from  referring to the sufferings of these children of the north  boys and  girls  torn from their families  carried off like bands of slaves to  other invaded regions to be employed on forced labour  france has  apprised the neutral countries of these facts  will they remain silent          further on it will be seen that much worse happened on numerous  other journeys           we got one pound of black sour bread per diem  in the morning we  had a tepid decoction intended for coffee  at mid day a pint and a half  of thick soup  and at night rather less than a pint of thin soup  on  three occasions only did we get potatoes  but never once meat  cabbage  soup was the usual thing and after a certain time it turned our  stomachs  certain prisoners were employed in chopping up the cabbages to  make sauerkraut  and they had to keep the broken leaves  as these were  used up for our soup           through an old habit  the commission makes use of this word  they  are not  hostages   of course          it must also be noted that when the commissioners making the  enquiry saw the repatriated people  they had had some time in which to  recover  first in switzerland  and then in france  the arrival of these  pitiable drafts gave rise  even among those of the swiss people who were  in principle the least hostile to germany  to such a feeling of horror  for their executioners that the kaiser took warning and thought it wiser  to suspend the repatriations for several months  for the welcome and the  kind care which our poor martyrs received at the hands of the swiss  our  grateful thanks and salutations are due           german excuses  lies and calumny      the boches have taken up three positions in succession  in the first  place  in their speeches  in their writings and by commemorative  pictures and medals   they have gloried in their misdeeds   thus  declaring that kultur is above morality  as stated by their writer   thomas mann   and that the right of german might is above everything   then  in the second place  when they discovered that in the world  outside them there was something known as a  moral conscience   not  understood by them  but still to be reckoned with   they cynically  denied the charges   finally  when they were driven from this second  trench  when simple negation became impossible   they had perforce to  explain their crimes      their commonest explanation is this   civilians fired on us       the  french commission of enquiry came to the following conclusion on this  point   this allegation is false  and those who put it forward have been  powerless to give it the appearance of truth  even though it has been  their custom to fire shots in the neighbourhood of dwellings  in order  to be able to affirm that they have been attacked by innocent  inhabitants  on whose ruin or massacre they had resolved      enquiries conducted by high magistrates have established the fact that  german officials are very frequently guilty of premeditated lies  it is  probable  all the same  that many german soldiers  on entering belgium  or france  were obsessed by the idea of civilians firing on them  the  cry of a soldier trembling with fear  drunk  or thirsting for  pillage   man hat geschossen  they have fired    is enough for a  locality to be delivered up at once to the wildest fury   when an  inhabitant has fired on a regiment   said a soldier at louvain   the  place belongs to the regiment   what a temptation for a boche soldier to  fire a shot that will at once unloose pillage and massacre     some mistakes have  possibly  been made which could have been avoided by  the least enquiry  read this admission recorded in his diary by a saxon  officer   the lovely village of gue d hossus has been given over to the  flames  though innocent in my opinion  i hear that a cyclist fell off  his machine and that his fall caused his rifle to go off of itself  as a  consequence there was firing in his direction  then  the male  inhabitants were simply hurled straight away into the flames  such  horrors will not be repeated  we must hope     there ought to be some  compulsion to verify suspicions of guilt in order to put a check on this  indiscriminate shooting of people      the only shots fired at them inside  or in the neighbourhood of   villages have been those of french or belgian soldiers covering their  retreat  sometimes this has been discovered  but too late  and they have  continued their crimes  in order to justify them     here is the statement of a neutral   in one village they found corpses  of german soldiers with the fingers cut off  and instantly the officer  in command had the houses set on fire and the inhabitants shot     in  the same district a german officer was billeted with a famous flemish  poet  the officer behaved courteously  was treated with consideration   and allowed himself to talk freely  his complaint was the misdeeds of  his soldiers  near haelen  he told his host  he had to have a soldier  shot on finding in his knapsack some fingers covered with rings  the  man  on being questioned  admitted that he had cut them off the bodies  of the german dead          in exceptional cases an enquiry is held  and in every such instance the  truth is discovered and massacre prevented     at the end of august  liebknecht      a member of the reichstag  set out  in his car for louvain  he came to a village where there was  considerable excitement going on  the germans had just found three of  their men lying dead on the road  and accused the peasants of being  responsible for the deed  liebknecht examined them  and was not long in  obtaining proof that the germans had been killed by belgian riflemen  at  huy there were shots in the night  two soldiers wounded  the populace  accused  the mayor arrested and condemned to death  but he knew that  there were no allied troops in the neighbourhood  and also that his own  people had not fired a shot   shoot me  if you like   he said calmly    but not before extracting the bullets from the wounded   the officer   less of a brute than some  gave his consent to this  the bullets in the  wounds were german bullets  but the germans do not even require a  pretext to take action  their first crime  to our knowledge  was on  august  th  some officers dashed up to herve in a car  challenged two  civilians while crossing the bridge and  without giving them time to  answer  shot them down with revolvers     in their private diaries they accuse one another  each throwing on his  neighbour the responsibility for crimes committed  a

at louvain  a german officer  treated  generously by a middle class family  and appreciating their courtesy   rushed to their house on the   th at    o clock in the morning      and  earnestly pressed his hosts to leave without delay  refusing to give  them any explanation  the family  puzzled and perturbed by his appeal   went off and so escaped                                                 in the eyes of the moralist the worst of all their crimes will perhaps  be this  that the wretches tried to dishonour belgium  after first  assassinating her  they have dared to say  write  and proclaim publicly   and affirm to neutrals  that belgian women and girls had mutilated  german wounded soldiers  blinding them with scissors or with boiling  water  the reports of the belgian commission of enquiry have been  replied to in a counter report     published as a german white book   this enquiry and these documents will live in history  in centuries to  come they will hang as a heavy weight on the kaiser s memory and the  conscience of germany  listen to the pathetic conclusion of the belgian  reply   before god and before man  the belgian government has no  hesitation in giving this as its opinion of the conduct of the german  government towards the belgian nation   he is twice guilty who violates  the rights of others and then attempts  with singular audacity  to  justify himself by imputing to his victim faults that were never  committed           it still remains to be explained how  by what means  by what deadly  influences  this german nation  consisting of men who  as individuals   are not all brigands  has reached and been led to this state of  savagery  in the preparations for this  collective madness  of a  people  what part has been played by its leaders of thought and its  politicians  by race and by education  this is a disturbing phenomenon  which students of mental disease     will study later  but on the  examination of which we cannot here embark  it is not for us to seek the  pathological cause for this moral decay  this decadence  we have only to  note its  effects          footnotes          need it be noted here that even if in any locality an imprudent  civilian had fired a shot  it would still remain  in accordance with the  hague convention  international law  and plain morality  a veritable  crime to massacre in a heap  haphazard

that commissions of enquiry  at which  both   sides should be represented  were offered by belgian socialists to  german socialists  by belgian freemasons to german freemasons  by  belgian bishops to

amputate  as a reprisal   all wounded limbs   so  we  are said to have  done that  a monstrous lie  which will be spurned indignantly by all who  know the honourable traditions of our ambulances and of our french  doctors  the  method of systematic lying  has been shown to the life in  connection with the use of asphyxiating gas  the boches made immense  preparations for the use of this gas  when their organization was  complete  they took care  before acting  to publish each day for a week  in their communiques  little notes announcing that the enemy were   making wide use of this new method of warfare    a statement contrary  to fact  and known by them to be so  but one that was calculated to  mislead public opinion  when they considered that public opinion was  sufficiently  prepared   they launched their deadly gases and their  flaming liquids  and we needed a long time  needed also to overcome our  moral hesitation  to make sure of our defence and our reply   cynical  lying  with

 germans of light and learning  and confront them with the  words of their own manifesto      as representatives of german science and art  we the undersigned   declare that        it is not true that germany provoked this war         it is not true that we have criminally violated the neutrality of  belgium         it is not true that our soldiers have made any attack on the life or  property of a single belgian citizen without being forced to it by sheer  necessity         it is not true that our troops brutally destroyed louvain         it is not true that we have conducted warfare in defiance of  international law  our soldiers commit neither undisciplined acts nor  cruelties              in this struggle we shall continue to the end to act as a  civilised nation  to whom the heritage of a goethe  a beethoven or a  kant is as sacred as our own hearth and home  we answer for that in our  own name and on our honour          and since irony is more powerful than abuse  let us

older and memorable saying of their great philosopher  hegel   the destiny of the german race is to supply the sustaining  pillars of christian teaching        footnotes          speaking of honour  it is as well to recall here the reply made by  a german officer to the schoolmaster at chanteheux  the schoolmaster  quite simply pledged his word of honour that no inhabitant had fired    you french

appeal of the belgian workmen to their brother  workers in other lands  this appeal ought to be fixed on the door of  every factory and workshop  every worker  every citizen  should study  it  we regret that we cannot reprint it here in full  but the following  extracts will at least give an idea of this new crime committed by  germany            workers   in the name of the international bonds that      unite all workmen  the working classes of      belgium  threatened  without exception  with slavery       deportation  and forced labour for the enemy s      gain  send to the working classes in other lands a      supreme appeal          germany  as you know  attacked and terrorised belgium      in      for having defended her right to neutrality and      her faith and honour          germany has been martyrizing belgium  she has from that      moment onwards turned the land into a prison  the      frontiers are armed against belgians like a battle      front   all our constitutional liberties have been      abolished  there is no longer safety anywhere  the      life of our citizens is at the mercy of the      policeman   arbitrary  limitless  pitiless     belgian      industrial idleness has been the creation of the      germans  maintained by them for their own profit           to these         unemployed they have for the last month      been saying   either you will sign a contract to work      for germany  or you will be reduced to slavery   in      either case  it means exile  deportation  forced labour      in the interests of the enemy  and against the interests      of our country  formidable punishments  the cruellest      ever invented by tyranny for the punishment of      crimes  and what  are  the crimes alleged     on the      western front  belgian workmen  your brothers and      ours  are being forced to dig trenches  to build      aviation camps  to fortify the german lines  and when      the victims  in spite of everything  are firm in their      refusal to take part in work forbidden by international      law  they are starved and beaten into illness  wounded       and sometimes even  killed           in germany  they are turned on to work in mines  and at      lime kilns  quite regardless of their age  profession       or trade  youths of seventeen  old men of seventy  are      deported in haphazard masses   is not this a revival of      ancient slavery with all its horrors      do you know       brothers  what the germans throw to their victims by way      of pay     pfennigs   d   a day          workers   never forget that the soldiers who are        acting as the torturers or our belgian workmen are      themselves german workers           in the depths of our distress  we count on you  it is      for you to act  for ourselves  even if brute force      succeeds for the moment in reducing our bodies to      servitude  we shall never give our consent          a final word  whatever tortures we may undergo  we do      not wish for peace except with the independence of our      country and the triumph of justice          the workmen of belgium        footnotes          by levying on belgium a war contribution which already exceeds  l            by transporting to germany food  merchandise and various  products to the value of more than l             by seizing and  despatching to their own country the greater portion of our raw  material  machines and accessories  by issuing threatening edicts to  prevent localities from using the unemployed on their own important  works of public utility           conclusion      what is our object     is it to incite our soldiers to commit  if chance arises  atrocities  like theirs  we repudiate with horror a thought such as that    defensive  reprisals  asphyxiating gas  liquid fire  etc   are  sometimes indispensable  reprisals for  revenge  would be unworthy of  us  but  without speaking of personal punishments  demanded by outraged  conscience  and essential in order that the two indivisible principles  of right and of responsibility may still exist in the world  we must  make it absolutely impossible for the wild beast to break out again  and  how  when the settling time draws near  and  in spite of weariness  a  new effort is needed to realise conditions of peace with guarantees for  the future  how could the allied nations accept the sacrifices still  demanded of them  if they remained in ignorance     it is not enough for these crimes to be known by governments and by a  few hundred people with leisure and inclination to read collections of  great volumes  they must be known by everybody  by the entire people  by  the people  who  in our proud and free countries  control  support   direct their governments and are the sole masters of their own destiny     our peoples ought to know the crimes committed in the name of  kultur    in order  at all costs  to take the precautions necessary to prevent for  ever their return  that is our first object  the second is this  to all  our martyrs we have a sacred duty  that of remembrance  there  where  they fell  we shall doubtless carve their names in stone or bronze  but  what of a time further away  when  after the long sufferings of this  war  freed humanity takes up again its works of peace  we shall see the  germans reappear in every land  at every cross road  men of commerce   industry  finance  science  men of the people and of society  in every  place where those of all countries  all races and all colours meet and  rub elbows  and what is our attitude to be  our answer is this  so long  as the nation in whose name and by whose hands these atrocities have  been committed has not herself solemnly cast from her the scoundrels who  dragged her into such decadence  we shall consider that it would betray  our martyrs for us even to rub shoulders with their executioners  and  that until the day arrives  if it ever does arrive  of a striking moral  repentance  to  forget  would be to  condone      l  mirman  prefect of meurthe et moselle     g  simon  g  keller  mayor of nancy  mayor of luneville             feeling glad to be back at my  desk again  after vacation  and now it s knock around again       all right  just stop and consider  there are four boys i know of   constituting the rod  gun and camera club  who have been busy planning  an outing for next summer  back of the lumber camps at the head of the  lake  talk to me about opportunities  what s to hinder us going into the  woods right now  and making use of our rods  guns  and that elegant new  camera your mother gave you on your birthday last week   demanded the boy  called jerry      what s all this about  you two conspirators   demanded one of two other  boys  swinging alongside just then  as though sure of a hearty welcome   and a voice at the council fire      glad you came  frank and bluff  for i want your opinion  jerry has  just sprung an astonishing idea on me  and i m so dazed i hardly know  what to say  are you ready for the question  all in favor of spending  the two weeks  additional vacation out in camp back of the lumbermen s  diggings say ay      the two newcomers looked at each other as if trying to grasp the  immensity of the proposition  then they pulled off their hats  and giving  a shout threw them into the air while both roared the affirmative word      ay      jerry looked at will  with a broad smile of delight on his face      three against one  the motion is carried   he declared  triumphantly      oh  come  i wasn t opposed to it in the start  only you stunned me by  such a sudden and glorious idea  we ll meet with some opposition at home   i expect  but where there s a will there s a way  and i move we make it  unanimous   will milton hastened to remark      bravo  consider it carried  and just to think what a chance it will be  for me to try out my new outfit   exclaimed the fourth boy  he who had  been called by the queer name of  bluff  by one of his comrades   possibly because  being the only son of a prominent lawyer  dick masters  may have been addicted to the habit of putting up a bold face even when  his heart was weak     jerry looked at him rather superciliously at this remark  and threw up  his hands in a manner to indicate discouragement      i m genuinely sorry for the feathered and furry game of the woods when  the great hunter breaks loose with that terrible pump gun  mighty little  chance for anything to get away after  that  is leveled  and the gatling  opens fire   he remarked scornfully      huh  it s all very well for you to talk that way  jerry  because you  happen to be a fine shot  and can bag your game the first clip  but  what s a fellow going to do when he finds it difficult to hit a barn  i d  like to wager that with all your high falutin  talk you do more  execution among the poor game than comes to my share   answered bluff   indignantly      oh  well  have it your own way  i ve tried my best to show you what a  genuine sportsman should be like  always giving the game a fair chance   didn t i induce you to quit fishing with that murderous gang hook last  summer  and when you did finally get a bass didn t you feel prouder than  if you just   yanked   him in  perhaps caught on the outside of his gills  with some of that deadly jewelry   demanded jerry  whose one hobby was  the  square deal  in all that he undertook      i acknowledge the corn about the gang hook  but that has nothing to do  with an up to date  repeating shotgun  and other things such as modern  campers use  i ve kept posted  and i know what s going on  some people  seem to be asleep  and are just contented to do as their forefathers did   i m progressive  that s what       well  boys   frank langdon here broke in with   suppose you postpone  that old chestnut of a dispute until we re snug in camp  and let s  talk about how the thing can be done  the first thing is to get  consent at home       i don t believe we need fear any trouble there  frank  you call us up on  the  phone in about an hour  and if everything s lovely and the goose  hangs high we ll meet at my house and make definite arrangements   said  will  whose mother was a well to do widow  and seldom refused her  idolized son any reasonable request      we could go on our motor cycles  and have a wagon bring the duffle  along  if it started at a decent hour in the morning we d be able to get  in camp by the middle of the afternoon  and have things fixed fairly well  for the first night   suggested jerry  his eyes bright with anticipations  of a delightful time ahead      you ve got all the things needed  frank  and now we ll see what your  experience up in maine amounted to  say  ain t this just glorious  think  of it  two weeks  outing at this beautiful time of the year  and up there  in the woods where we were just planning to go next summer  i wonder if  old jesse wilcox has begun to set his traps yet  that s his  stamping ground  you know  during the winter  and he makes quite a haul  of muskrats   coons  some mink and even an otter once in a long while    said bluff  enthusiastically  he was always a leading spirit in new  ventures  but lacked the pertinacity of frank      don t you worry  old fellow  i ll be johnny on the spot when it comes  to delivering the goods  but all further talking had better be put off  until we find out whether we can go or not  so i move we adjourn  to  meet again an hour from now at will s shack   remarked young langdon   always logical     they had stopped to talk the matter over alongside one of the stores in  the town  and indeed bluff was perched upon an empty box  that lay at the  foot of a small pyramid of similar cases  piled up until such time as  they could be sold or destroyed     while the others were talking  jerry had made a little discovery that  aroused both his curiosity and his temper  he had seen a touseled head   surmounted by a cap he knew full well  push up a little above the rim of  the most elevated empty box  as if some concealed listener might be  endeavoring to hear better  and in his eagerness recklessly exposed  himself in this way     jerry was always prompt about doing things  nor did he  as a rule  stop  to figure what the immediate consequences might prove to be     indignation at the idea of their conference having been overheard  possessed his soul  and  seeing a splendid chance to bring the plans  of the listener to a sudden and disastrous end  he managed without  warning to give one of the boxes a flirt with his hand that moved it  out a foot or two     as it happened to be the keystone of the arch  the consequence was the  entire pile came tumbling down  much after the fashion of a crumbling  church during an earthquake     bluff gave a wild shout  and sprang to a position of safety  to turn and  stare in astonishment at the remarkable result of the catastrophe     from under the ruins a figure came crawling slowly  rubbing sundry places  about his legs and sides  where the sharp corners of the boxes had been  in cruel contact with his flesh      why  it s andy lasher   exclaimed jerry  pretending to be wonderfully  surprised   where in the world did you come from  hiding in that drygoods  box  eh  up to some of your old tricks  andy  i guess  going to carry off  the whole dry goods emporium that time  perhaps      the boy managed to get upon his feet  though he continued to limp around  and rub his legs vigorously  as he whistled to keep from groaning     andy lasher was known as the town bully  and many a time had he taken  delight in giving our four friends more or less trouble  jerry and he had  always been at loggerheads  and could look back to half a dozen occasions  in the past where the contest for supremacy had brought them to the point  of battle     each time andy was supposed to have gotten the better of the conflict   though his friends thought he paid dearly for his victory  but jerry  seemed never to know when he was whipped  and was just as ready to try  conclusions with the other as before      some fine day i ll know how to outwit the big brute  and then i mean to  cure him of his bullying ways   he was wont to say cheerfully  as he  festooned his face with strips of adhesive plaster  and tried to grin  through the pain      what d ye mean upsetting me that way  jerry wallington  think just  because your dad s a big railroad man you can knock poor fellers around  any old way  i guess i ve got some rights  you might have killed me   tumbling that pile of boxes down  with me inside  you ought to be made to  pay fur it  that s what   grumbled the fellow  scowling vindictively  and  yet not daring to assume the offensive while the four chums were present   for he had never tried conclusions with frank  and was suspicious of the  new boy in centerville  for the langdons had lived there about a year   frank s father having purchased the bank of which he was now president      how could i know anybody was hiding up there   demanded jerry  in  pretended ignorance  though his eyes twinkled with humor as he watched  the bully limping around and still rubbing his knee      ain t i got a right to play hide and seek with my friends  who told you  to stop just underneath  and talk about campin  out up above the lumber  docks  think you re the whole team  do you  well  perhaps you won t shout  just so loud when you know me and some of my mates are going up in that  region ourselves  to morrow  to see old bud rabig  the trapper  and if we  have any trouble with you sissies there s bound to be a high old mix up   see   and he glared first at one and then at each of the others in turn     the boys looked at one another in dismay  for it seemed as though some  would be joker had tossed a bucket of ice cold water over them  this  vague threat of andy lasher s was not to be lightly dismissed as mere  bluff  for whatever his reputation might be  the fellow had a way of  keeping his word  especially when it concerned any sort of mischief     frank  however  laughed aloud      that sort of talk doesn t cut any figure with us  lasher  if we go up to  the head of the lake we ll try and mind our own business  and advise all  others to do the same  if they know what s good for them  we re not out  looking for trouble  but  if it comes along  you and your cronies will  find that there are four fellows who know how to take care of  themselves  got that  andy   he said sternly     the bully looked at him fixedly for a moment  and then drawing back his  short upper lip after a way he had  and which made his face resemble that  of a snarling wolf  with fangs exposed  he remarked      it makes me laugh to think of such a lot of tenderfeet in the woods  be  careful not to shoot yourselves  kids  guns are mighty dangerous  sometimes  and just make up your minds that we ain t agoing to be scared  by big words  the fellows that train with me have been up against hard  knocks too often to knuckle down before a lot of bluster and brag  them  two weeks ll be the liveliest you ever knew  take my word for it      with his tongue in his cheek he scurried away  just in time to avoid the  proprietor of the store  who now came bustling out to learn what all the  racket might mean  and found our four boys busily replacing his pyramid  of empty boxes           chapter ii    ready for the start      centerville was a thriving town situated almost midway down the east  shore of camalot lake  and very nearly opposite newtonport on the  opposite bank  in consequence  there was more or less rivalry between the  two places  which condition extended from the shopkeepers and banks to  the sports of the boys of the bustling miniature cities     since the four chums are to figure as the leading spirits in our stirring  tales of the outdoor club  it seems only proper that we should take an  early opportunity to introduce them more fully to the reader  together  with some of their more prominent hobbies  hoping that the acquaintance  thus begun may ripen into warm intimacy as we journey along in company     jerry wellington s father was a railroad magnate  and in full sympathy  with his boy s love for the open  indeed  it was from the elder  wellington that jerry  no doubt  inherited his love for fair play   whether in games on the baseball or football arena  or in sports afield   his sympathies seemed to be always with the under dog in the fight  and  he would scorn to shoot a rabbit or a quail unless in full flight  or to  take a game fish by any other means than the methods in vogue among true  sportsmen     on the other hand  bluff masters could never get it through his head what  need there was for all this fuss and feathers about giving the game a  chance  he had the old primal instinct of the red indian  whose one  desire was to secure his quarry  no matter whether by hook or by crook   since bluff never pretended to be anything of a shot  or an expert  angler  perhaps he was right in believing that  so far as he was  concerned  the game had all the chance necessary at any and all times     frank langdon  as mentioned before  was the son of the banker  and having  lived up in maine knew about all there was to know about the tricks of  campers  since his chums as yet had had only limited chances to discover  what the extent of his knowledge might be  they were very anxious to put  frank to the test  and learn a few of the said wrinkles  calculated to  make them better sportsmen     frank had one sister  a pretty girl named nellie  and bluff masters  had shown a decided partiality for her ever since they were first  brought together     the last one of the quartette  will milton  was one of the rich widow s  two children  and since he and frank were deeply interested in  photography  it was perhaps only natural that frank should be attracted  by will s twin sister  violet  whom he believed to be the sweetest girl  of his acquaintance     these four boys attended the private school of alexander gregory  d p    and the sudden announcement that during a recent storm the buildings had  suffered so severely as to necessitate the closing of the academy for a  limited period  had fallen upon the community like a thunderbolt from a  clear sky     those students coming from a distance were being sent away at the expense  of the proprietor of the school  and others  who belonged either in  centerville or newtonport  were allowed to go home  subject to a call  some two weeks later     while the boys worked at replacing the fallen boxes  they kept up a  running fire of observations regarding this new calamity that threatened  their peace  for when andy lasher and the ugly crowd with which he  trained took a notion to make themselves disagreeable they could do it   to the queen s taste   as jerry said      shall we give the outing up   asked frank  after he had heard some of  the dire prophecies advanced by his comrades  especially bluff masters      never   exclaimed jerry      ditto   cried will  looking more determined than ever      oh  i m just as anxious to go as any one  only it seemed right to look  the old thing squarely in the face before we started to lay plans  if the  rest say go  you can count on me all right  i m the last to squeal if  trouble comes  and you know that  fellows   declared bluff  glancing  around defiantly     it was a habit with bluff to be always expecting something serious to  happen  and in case his suspicions were verified  as might occasionally  occur  he would crow over the others  and strut around as though he  thought himself a prophet gifted with second sight  and able to forecast  coming events with ease     on the other hand  should the prediction fail to come about there was  always a good excuse handy to account for the failure      well   said frank  as he winked at jerry   since we are all of one mind   i don t know why we should waste any more time about it  for one  i m  going straight to the bank and have a friendly chat with my dad  i just  feel dead certain he ll be as tickled over the chance of an outing as i  am  he never forgets that he was a boy  you see  so long  fellows  see  you later at will s house      there was a scattering then and there  bluff heading in the direction of  the building where his father had his offices  while the other two kept  on in company  their homes being close together     will was the only one who really expected any show of opposition  for his  widowed mother simply idolized him  seeing every day new traits of  character as well as little facial resemblances that made him appear more  and more like the husband and father who was gone  but then the boy knew  just how to overcome these scruples  and his arguments were always backed  up by his twin sister  so that in the end he usually attained his wish     his one great hobby lay in the line of photography  and such had been his  remarkable success with a cheap outfit that his mother had surprised and  delighted the boy on a recent birthday by giving him an expensive camera     of course  he was fairly wild to get away into the woods and secure many  stunning pictures of the great outdoor folks  the birds and animals  inhabiting the wilds  will cared little about shooting  and expected to  do all his hunting with his camera     when about an hour later frank called each of his chums up on the  phone   and eagerly demanded to know how things had turned out  he was delighted  to hear them say one after the other that everything was lovely  and full  permission to go had been duly granted     after lunch they held a grand pow wow at the home of will  to which the  two girls were admitted  for it had been deemed best that all the schools  in both centerville and newtonport should be closed for a few days  in  order to make a few needed repairs after the storm      frank  consider yourself appointed commander in chief  and now please  tell each of us what we must do   said will  as they gathered around in  the living room      i ll see about the wagon that is to take our stuff up  one of us can  meet the driver on the road after we ve picked out the spot for the camp   every fellow be sure to have his outfit ready at seven in the morning   bring two blankets apiece  and the things i ve written down here  a  towel  soap  and such little necessities   returned frank      who looks after the grub part of it   demanded bluff  who was never  known to be separated from his appetite      that s my part  too   said frank   only  if any of you have any  particular fancy in the line of stuff to eat now s the time to add it to  the list i ve made out       let s take a squint at it  partner   remarked bluff  anxiously     he ran through the list      don t think i m going on short rations   laughed frank  noting the  expression akin to dismay appearing on the other s face   but you see  we ll have our motor cycles along  and when we need a new lot of  groceries it ll just be fun to mount and fly down here to pick up a  bundle  read out the variety  bluff  and see if any one thinks we want  anything else       h m  here s matches  sugar  tea  coffee  condemned milk  i mean  condensed milk  butter  four loaves of bread made at home by frank s  hired girl  who s a dandy cook   read bluff  in a sing song tone   then  comes bacon  salt pork for cooking fish with  half a ham  potatoes   pepper and salt  self raising flour  cornmeal  fine hominy  rice  beans   canned corn  tomatoes  boston baked beans  a jar of jam  canned  corned beef and crackers      what else  don t all speak at once   asked frank  holding a  pencil ready      i say a nice juicy beefsteak for the first night in camp  we won t be  able to produce any game at short notice  i reckon  and that would be  fine  just put that down for my sake  chief   observed jerry      and  say  ain t we going to have any onions   asked bluff indignantly   at which frank doubled up as if taken with a fit      that s one on me  boys  why  i wouldn t ever think of going into camp  without a supply of good onions along  if you ever came trudging home at  evening  with game on your back  tired to beat the band  and when near  camp sniffed fired onions cooking  you d say they re the best thing ever  toted into the wilderness  that s the time you showed your good sense   bluff  old man  onions  why  to be sure  and plenty of  em  anything  more   he laughed     the boys shook their heads  they had not had enough experience in camping  out to warrant suggesting other additions to the apparently complete list  made by the fellow who had been there  and knew all about the needs of  those who go into the wilderness      all right  if you happen to think of anything just get it  that s all   look at jerry grinning there  i bet i know what he s thinking about  that  all this is utter foolishness  and that we ought to start out with  nothing more than we could carry on our machines  and then take  pot luck  how about that   demanded frank      oh  well  have it your own way  fellows   declared jerry  with a shrug  of his shoulders   you know my ideas about these things  i m the kind of  a sportsman who goes into the woods as light as possible  give me a  frying pan  coffee pot  tin cup and a pie platter  some pepper and salt   some matches  a camp hatchet to cut browse for my bed  and my trusty  rifle with which to supply the game  and i warrant you i can get along as  well as the fellow who makes a pack horse of himself  and totes all sorts  of canned goods over the carries       that sounds all mighty well in theory  but there s mighty little  practical sense about it  a blanket is the camper s best friend of a cool  night  and even if he is lucky enough to shoot enough game to satisfy his  wants  he ll get sick of one diet in a short time  i ought to know  something about it  for i ve tried it both ways   declared frank      yes   broke in bluff at this juncture   and you wait and see if jerry  don t eat his share of every blessed thing we pack in  he won t refuse  one dish  he s quite satisfied to turn up his nose at others carrying  loads  while he goes free  but  at the same time  he eats a quarter of  the grub every time      both frank and will laughed heartily at this  in which they were joined  by nellie langdon and violet milton      pshaw   scoffed jerry  turning a bit red at the same time   if others  are silly enough to make pack horses of themselves  and lug all such  things into the primeval wilderness  why  of course  i m willing to help  dispose of them when the time comes  purely out of good heartedness  you  see  for it makes their loads lighter  just drop that subject  boys  and  put me down for a bottle of maple syrup  for when frank gives us some of  those famous flapjacks he s told about so often  we ought to have the  proper thing to go with them      so they talked the thing over from beginning to end  and it looked as if  the team frank expected to engage would have their work cut out for them   hauling all this camp stuff over the roads to the point beyond the head  of the lake     the boys were evidently eager to get to work  and hence the conference  presently broke up  jerry heading in one direction  and frank and his  sister  with bluff finding some plausible excuse for hanging on  going  in another     later on that day  while frank was at the big grocery store  giving  orders to have the various edibles put up so as to be ready on the  following morning before seven o clock  he was interested in seeing andy  lasher  backed by several of his pals  actually making similar purchases   though just where they secured the necessary funds  having no rich  fathers to appeal to  was somewhat of a mystery     andy sent many a dark look across at the tall boy he secretly feared  but  apparently he knew that this was no time to bring matters to a head  and  hence there was nothing said  but the look on his freckled face told of  dark intentions           chapter iii    the race for a camp site       all aboard for kamp kill kare      frank langdon jumped off his motor cycle as he shouted these words  and  there was a scurrying among the other three boys  who had gathered at the  house of will  which had been mentioned as a place of meeting     each motor cycle had numerous small packages secured about it after the  individual fancy of the owner  will carried his precious camera over his  shoulder  but the tripod  a folding affair of the latest patent  was tied  to his wheel  jerry and frank had their guns securely cased  and so  arranged that they would not interfere with either the working of the  machine or any jumping on and off  while bluff carried his new repeating  shotgun hung from his back with a strap     he saw jerry eyeing the same with a sneer  and was up in arms  immediately      just you wait  and don t cry before you re hurt  this bang up modern  machine shooter is no more murderous for me than yours is in your hands    sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof   and i m ready to compare  notes at the end of our little expedition  to see who has slaughtered the  most game   and bluff wagged his round head with its thatch of yellow  hair  defiantly      well  a man is known by the company he keeps  and any true  sportsman    began jerry  ready to open the discussion on the spot      rats   exclaimed will  as he got in readiness to mount his machine    stow all that hot air until the first chilly night  perhaps you ll need  it before long  i say  frank       well  what       has the wagon started along   asked the other  eagerly      yes  i saw it off before coming over here  everything s aboard  and  unless old uncle toby has an accident on the road  he guarantees to get  up there shortly after noon   replied the leader  quietly      so  you got your hired man to do the driving  and i ve half a suspicion  the team comes from your place  too  that s mighty nice of your father   frank  suppose we could keep toby with us one night to see us started       father said we could have him all we wanted  he can take the horses  over to the nearest farm  where we expect to get our supply of fresh  eggs  and then do a part of the cooking for us  as well as chop wood and  some other stunts that  say what you will  kind of pall on a fellow after  a little while       better and better   remarked jerry  who had been known on occasion to  flunk when it came to drudgery  and wanted to be fishing or roaming  pretty much all the day  and every day      well  the reason i asked was this  i wouldn t wonder but what andy  lasher and his pals might plan to intercept our supplies  and do  something mean to break up our fun   continued will  earnestly      whew  i hadn t thought of that   remarked jerry  looking alarmed      i had  and i made an arrangement with old uncle toby to take erastus  along in the wagon up to the point where we are to meet him at noon  you  know erastus is the porter and watchman at the bank  and known to be a  fighter  when they see him sitting there beside toby those fellows will  have business somewhere else  you mark me  he can come home on the late  afternoon train  one of us taking him over to the little station on a  motor cycle  how does that suit you all around       talk about your napoleon for laying out plans  it couldn t be better  arranged  the supplies will be safe  then  now  is there anything else to  remember   demanded jerry      not from me   replied bluff  stealing a side glance at the open window  where nellie and violet were standing  watching the starting of the  wonderful expedition that was expected to startle the timid woods folks  up beyond the lumber camps at the head of the lake      count me out   declared will  raising one foot to be ready to mount      that settles it  then  who goes first   asked frank      you do  to start with  later on  after we pass the wagon  jerry will act  as guide  as he s been up there before  and knows a lot about the  country   called will      then  here goes  fellows      suiting the action to the word frank ran with his machine  then gave a  vault into the saddle  started the engine  and with a loud popping the  motor cycle began to hustle along the road at a moderately swift pace     jerry came second  then will  and last but not least bluff  who was very  apt to have many things happen to his motor cycle before the ten miles  had been reeled off  for that seemed to be just his fortune      good luck   called the girls from the window  while the little  mother waved a  kerchief from the doorway  and then hurried in to  shed a few tears  for  truth to tell  these partings always affected  her in this way     through the town they went  with dogs racing alongside and barking  wildly  and quite a few persons waving them good wishes as they passed   for it was pretty well known what the outdoor club had in view  and the  hunting toggery with which bluff had adorned himself was a constant sign  as to the glut there would presently be in the game market of  centerville     then past frank s home  where his father waved his hat as he stood in the  doorway  warned of the coming of the squad by the rampant popping of the  motor cycles  and after that the open country  where the northbound road  ran alongside the calm waters of lake camalot  now glistening in the  frosty air of an october morning     frank slowed up to allow of jerry overtaking him  so that they might talk  as they covered the miles      there s the wagon ahead   he said      i had noticed it  and just beyond i thought i saw several fellows up on  the bank  perhaps andy and his chums  it might be well for us to close  in and be ready to defend the wagon if necessary  and look out for any  sort of sharp pointed nails on the road  apt to slash our tires    remarked jerry  who had experienced so much of the trickery of the  lasher crowd that he believed there was nothing too mean or small for  them to attempt      not a bad idea  so slow up until the other boys arrive  they may hardly  feel like doing anything  now that we happen along       i d feel sure they wouldn t if we could only coax bluff to exhibit that  awful pump gun of his  talk about your scorchers  i think andy would run  a mile  i know i would if i thought the murderous thing was going to be  turned on me   growled jerry  who  as the reader must already have  noticed  was a very persistent fellow  and hard to convince  especially  when on his favorite subject of a fair deal for every living creature     they moderated their speed  and passed the place where the hostile group  stood  with two riders on either side of the supply wagon     then it was seen that andy and his associates had impressed a  hungry looking  gaunt mule into their service  the said animal being  fairly loaded down with an assortment of the most astonishing articles  ever dreamed of in the mind of would be campers     under the circumstances  with erastus and toby to help guard the camp  outfit  andy s crowd did not dare lift a hostile hand  but they took  especial pains to hoot at the little company as it wheeled past  making  more or less sarcastic remarks  and yet being careful not to go too far     the truth was  they did not wholly like the looks of the big colored man  who sat there with old toby  and of whose abilities as a fighter they  happened to know something about     when the rival campers had been left far behind  the boys considered it  safe to part company with the supply train  and dash off      we ve got lots to do  locating on a good campsite  remember  fellows   those sort of things don t grow on every bush  i tell you  so  come  along   and frank  as he spoke  let out another kink  the popping grew  more furious  and away he shot up the road in a little cloud of dust   with jerry at his rear  ready to take the lead as soon as there was any  necessity for choosing at the forks     ten miles is a mere  flea bite   as bluff masters said  when a good   lively motor cycle  takes the bit in its teeth   and it seemed as though  they had hardly more than got well started before the junction was  reached  where jerry swung ahead  and the rest trailed after him     the pace had to be more moderate after this  for the going was not so  even  but  nevertheless  they made fair time  and finally swung around at  the head of the lake  where the logging camp was situated     it was early in the season  but there were some timber cutters at work in  the woods near by  and a greasy man cook stood in the doorway of the long  log cabin where the gang put up throughout the winter  while conducting  their operations of leveling the forest  or  at least  robbing it of all  the spruce for the pulp mill over at bedington     jerry held up at the lumber camp  for he wished to ask a few questions of  the cook  who was a man he happened to know in a small way  though never  particularly fancying jock stovers     the fellow stared at seeing a quartette of elegant motor cycles come  dashing up to the loggers  winter quarters      hello  jock  we re going into the woods to spend a week or two  wagon  following after with all the stuff  where do you suppose we could run  across old jesse wilcox these days  and is he starting to do any  trapping   asked jerry     the lumber camp cook grinned a little as he took in the new and striking  hunting apparel which bluff masters sported so airily  doubtless he  immediately concluded that the whole party must be a set of greenhorns   incapable of knowing enough to come in out of the wet when it rained      oh  yes  he s to work  they tells me  leastwise i heerd ole bud rabig  complainin  thet he never did hev a show wen jesse he was around    cause the annermiles they jest seem ter hanker arter jesse s traps   folks do say he hes a kinder scent he uses ter jest coax  em like    replied the cook  not above hoping these sons of centerville rich  people might think it worth while to toss him a generous tip for any  information he gave them      we are heading for that old camp by the twin hemlocks  where that spring  bubbles up  winter and summer  one of us will be back here to convoy old  toby in with the chuck wagon  and get erastus over the farmers  station   where he can catch a late train back  just tell them to wait here  if  they come before i arrive  and here s some tobacco money for your  trouble  jock      the cook nimbly caught the flying coin  and grinned his thanks      oh  i ll tell  em all right  don t yer be  fraid  jerry  say  they was a  party o  three as started in ter camp jest whar ye say  about a hull hour  ago  boys from centerville  too  but a tough lookin  bunch  they tried to  do me for a breakfast  but i come out with a gun  and they shooed  reckon  that pet peters was wun o  the gang       whew      jerry looked at the others in some dismay      what ll we do  fellows  that s andy s right bower  he must have started  the three of them up here last night  meaning to have them squat by the  spring first  and keep us off  and i did want to camp just there above  all places  it s been on my mind all night   exclaimed jerry   disconsolately      an hour  you said  jock   asked frank  always quick to decide  knotty points      i reckons about that  but them fellers was dog tired  an  i don t think  they s agoin  ter git up to thet spring in a hurry   replied the cook   still squeezing the half dollar  as if to  make it squeal   as bluff  remarked later      perhaps we can get there before they do  suppose we make a try  jerry      for answer jerry started his machine on a run  jumped aboard  and was  quickly dashing away at rather a reckless pace  considering the rough   tote  road he had to follow     the others were close at his heels  and altogether the rattling reports  of the four exhausts quite excited the lumber camp cook  who stood there  in the doorway gaping  as long as the motor cycles remained in sight           chapter iv    under the twin hemlocks       say  ain t this going some  for a rough road   called bluff  who was  pounding along close behind jerry  will bringing up the rear      beats everything i ever did on wheels  wow  that was a scorcher of a  jolt  i hope none of the wheels break down   answered the other  over his  shoulder  but he dared not take his eyes off the uneven  tote  road which  they were following  for more than a second at a time  lest some  unfriendly root hurl him into the ditch  a wreck      see anything of  em  frank   wheezed jerry a bit later  as he kept  his machine close behind the leader  for somehow in this race for  the campsite frank just naturally forged to the front from mere  force of habit      thought i had a peep of something moving ahead  soon know   came  the answer     some more jumping followed  and it required considerable agility on the  part of the four riders to keep their saddles     then they made a turn  and discovered three boys in full flight ahead      there they are   cried jerry  in excitement      how far ahead is the spring   called frank      about half a mile  i reckon       good  then the game is ours  barring accidents      the three fellows ahead kept turning around every dozen seconds  as if  worried at the rapid approach of the others      keep your eyes peeled  they re hatching up some sort of mischief    called frank  who knew the signs     he saw that the others began to wobble in their movements  which was  plain evidence that they had tired themselves out by their night tramp   and were in no condition to compete with the motorcycles  even on this  rough stretch of road     the tall  athletic looking leader of the trio suddenly jumped aside  and  stooped over as if snatching something from the ground       ware  hawks   shouted bluff  who had noted this maneuver     it could now be easily seen that pet peters had fastened upon quite a  cumbersome branch of a fallen tree  and his purpose was manifest when he  stepped out as if to drop it across the road  meaning to wreck the  machines as they swept on     frank changed his course just a trifle  but was now heading straight for  the unprincipled schemer  who would have taken the chances of seriously  injuring some of the party in order to further his own plans     the sight of that heavy motor cycle heading straight at him rather  demoralized pet  who did not know but that frank meant to chase him until  he got him  so that he dropped the branch before he had quite covered the  entire space across the narrow road  and made a wild leap for safety     consequently  frank was able to veer aside and skim past the dangerous  obstruction without coming a  cropper  in the ditch     jerry also swept by  and the others were coming so fast on the heels of  the two leaders that the bewildered roughs could not pull their wits  together in time to make any successful swoop     perhaps they were not particularly anxious to arouse the party after  all  for the sight of the weapons they carried  and  above all  the  martial appearance of the khaki clad bluff  must have impressed them  more than a little      hurrah  the camp is ours   yelled the tail ender  as he clung to the  rear of the remarkable procession  for never before had these solemn  woods witnessed anything like such a progressive picture of modern magic  as these four lads booming along on metal steeds capable of making fifty  miles an hour and more  in case of necessity  and over a smooth road     a few minutes later of more moderate traveling brought them to a point  where a view could be had of the camp site      over to the right  notice those twin hemlocks yonder  well  the  wonderful spring bubbles up close beside those trees  hold up  frank    called jerry     so the quartette dismounted  jumping from their wheels while still in  motion  after the habit of those who use motor cycles     in another minute all of them were bending low over the spring  testing  the delightfully clear waters of the same     loud were the exclamations of satisfaction that arose  for their ride had  made them thirsty  and the water was as cold as ice      a cracking good spot for a camp   was the verdict of the experienced  frank  as he allowed his eyes to rove about  and take in the  surroundings     jerry beamed with pleasure      knew you couldn t help liking it  for it seemed to cover all the  necessities of the case  as far as i know them   declared jerry  whose  knowledge was founded pretty much on theory based on extensive reading  rather than a practical experience such as frank had passed through      this little knoll will serve to shed water when it rains  as it s sure  to do some time or other  it always does when you camp  and the water is  just far enough away to keep the spring from being polluted by any refuse  from the fire  yes  and the trees around here have not been touched by  lumbermen  so that the whole aspect is restful to the eye  i like it   jerry  it s a regular jim dandy place       hunk  i say   declared bluff  after his usual explosive fashion  but if  his manner was crude  he generally hit the nail on the head  and no one  could mistake his feelings in the matter     he immediately squatted down and began to take his gun out of its case   an operation jerry eyed with alarm      say  look here  what are you going to do with that machine  eh  are  you so wild to get at the slaughter that you can t wait a decent length  of time  and give the poor birds and beasts a chance to know we re here  for a long stay  for goodness  sake  show some sportsman spirit   bluff   he exploded     the other looked up with an injured expression      why   said he   i m only thinking of those three desperate characters  rushing our camp  and i wanted to let them see we are able to look out  for ourselves  that s what       oh  if that s the case  hold up that tool  and i bet they light out  faster than they come  who wouldn t  i d just like to know  when        hey  jerry  can the wagon get in here   asked will  knowing what the  dispute would lead to if allowed to go on any further      why  yes  i think so  if toby knows how to manage right  you see he can  turn to the right  cross behind that thicket  and bring up here   certainly the wagon can haul up here  if it ever gets to this point  safe   replied the other      you and i will look out for that  and when we ride back to convoy it  here  depend on it  we ll have our guns ready to make a good showing    remarked frank   i don t think those three fellows will dare attack us   especially when they see erastus  they know him all right  from sad  experience  you see  rastus used to be something of a prizefighter in a  small way among his kind  and nothing delights him half so much as a  scrap once in a while  and the town rowdies have suffered at his hands       all right  say when  and i ll be ready to go       plenty of time  i figure that the wagon won t get to the lumber camp  until noon  so in the meantime we can be using that nice ax will has  strapped to his machine  and doing a number of things  firewood is a  mighty handy article to have around a camp  boys  and it s simply  wonderful what a big lot of it is needed       a hint is as good as a command  frank  just understand that we re ready  to do anything you suggest  for we all want to learn the ropes as soon as  we can  what are you going to do   he asked  as frank unsheathed a camp  hatchet  and commenced to look around  as if in search of some particular  kind of wood      well  you see  i remember that i lost my tent pegs the last time i  camped in maine  and it s up to me to cut a new supply  no better time  than now  while we re waiting for the wagon  then i expect to lay out  several poles on which to stretch the tents  one tall one for the  center  and a couple of others outside for the fly that forms a  shelter   remarked frank  commencing operations on what seemed a  suitable piece of hickory      what sort of tents are they   asked jerry  watching all that the other  did  so as to catch the true spirit of the thing from practical  observation  which somehow seemed vastly different from what he read in  his books on sport      the kind which most canoeists like in these modern days  they re big  enough to accommodate four in a pinch  although it s much better to have  only two in each  and that s why i brought both along  then  when the fly  in front is raised it makes a splendid place for the table  being  sheltered from sun and rain  each tent has a waterproof floorcloth  to  keep the dampness out  wait and see  jerry      they worked like beavers for a time     when one tired his muscles chopping firewood another was eager to take up  the job  and it was wonderful how the pile of fuel increased     frank rubbed his hands with pleasure when  an hour or more later  he came  over to take a look at it  having completed his own task  as the quantity  of tent pegs announced      that s fine  fellows  he declared  laughing   if you d ever gone through  what i did once  when lost in the maine woods one bitter cold night   you d never think you could have too big a pile of the stuff  perhaps  some time i ll tell you about that experience  for i ll never forget it   never  but  jerry  suppose we get ready to run back to the lumber shack   and wait there for the wagon  i won t be easy until we see it here  a  little snack first from the grub i ve got here  and which nellie put up  for us  and then we ll meander over the back trail   he said      grub   exclaimed bluff  starting up from the soft  mossy cushion he had  fashioned  after doing his little stunt with the ax   count me in   please  and especially if your sister put it up  frank  for i reckon it  must be the boss feed then      at which the others smiled  for bluff s weakness regarding frank s pretty  sister was something of a joke among them     but when the package was undone there were broad grins  for dainty  sandwiches flanked by a generous assortment of wings and drumsticks   connected at one time with a number of spring chickens  came into view   besides some pickles  and even a bunch of cookies  which frank assured  his chums had been actually made by the fair hands of nellie herself     they had hardly known just how hungry they were until the first bite was  taken  and then little was said for some time  on account of the rapidity  with which those four sets of sturdy jaws worked     but  as might have been expected  bluff was the first one to reach out  his hand and secure one of the aforesaid cookies  which he munched with  closed eyes  as if mentally picturing the sweet girl from whom the  treat had come      all ready for the road  jerry   exclaimed frank  jumping up      on deck  captain  i m with you   came the reply  just as cheerily      you fellows keep a good watch  though i don t fancy you ll be  bothered by the three advance scouts of the lasher brigade   remarked  frank  as he pushed his machine into position  and prepared to run  with it for a start      huh   grunted jerry  casting a side glance toward bluff  who was  already shifting his repeating shotgun to a position where it could lie  across his knees as he sat there on his mossy hassock   i bet they  won t  not as long as that thing is in sight  talk about your  scarecrows  i d like to wager        to be continued in our next  come along  jerry   cried frank  as he  started on     a minute later the merry popping of the two exhausts told that the convoy  for the  chuck wagon   as they called it  was on the way           chapter v    the first camp supper       they don t seem to be around   said jerry  when he and his chum had  covered at least half the distance to the lumber camp  without seeing  a sign of the three fellows who had tried to dispute their advance in  the morning      i hope they re not hovering around our camp  to make trouble for the  boys   observed frank  shaking his head     the other laughed aloud in a scoffing way      all i can say is  i m mighty sorry for pet and his pals if they try that  sort of business when that criminal of a bluff is sitting there with his  gatling gun  ready for work  i d sooner face a tiger  honest i would   than that instrument of destruction  i bet there won t be a chippy left  around here when we get out       oh  shucks  jerry  remember that he isn t in your class  when he empties  that six shot gun and makes a miss every time  what does it matter  if  the game had only poor bluff and his repeater to fear they could well  laugh  but when  you  look over the sights it s a different matter       that s nice of you  frank  i ll try and be more lenient with the poor  fellow  then  anyhow  i know he shuts both eyes when he pulls the  trigger  for i ve watched him more than once  a man that s gun shy never  will make a success as a hunter  isn t that so       i ve been told so  but  all the same  bluff is a good hearted chap  and  i like him first rate  he furnishes fun for the whole squad  and   besides  nothing makes him mad  at least  if he ever brushes up it s  over and done with like a flash  but isn t that the lumber camp ahead  i  thought i had a glimpse of it through the trees  there it is again    said frank      you re right  but i don t see the wagon       i hardly thought it would be here before half an hour more  we  needn t go any farther than the cabin  and can be taking in the sights  while we wait       precious little to see here  don t compare with some of the big  camps up in your maine  i guess  but they re making a gash in the  timber all right  and in a few years it ll be all gone  that is  what  is worth taking      they came to a halt near the log cabin  from which the head of the cook  was quickly thrust  he having heard the sound of their engines as they  approached      back again  boys   he inquired genially  for the vision of that coin was  still fresh in his memory      bad penny always comes back  jock   laughed jerry      we ve come to convoy the wagon in  you see all our supplies  tents  grub  and blankets happen to be in that wagon  and we don t mean to let it be  captured by any of the lasher crowd   remarked frank     he saw the cook start at the mention of that name  as he muttered      butch lasher a comin  up hyer  then them fellers must aben some o   his pals       just what they were   and frank went on to explain how it came there was  a second vacation for the academy boys of centerville  and also the  unfortunate fact of andy  known among his chums as  butch  for some  unexplained reason  having determined to take an outing in the same  region at the identical time they had arranged to come      we expect to have trouble with them right along  but they d better be  careful how they try any of their smart tricks on us up here  we mean to  let them alone  if they mind their business and pay no attention to us   but  on the other hand  we know how to defend ourselves  and we ve got  the means to do it   he went on     the cook shook his touseled head      thet critter is sure a terror  an  i orter know   was all he would  say  but the boys could imagine that there was some sort of a story  back of it     less than ten minutes later  while jerry was prowling around looking  at the bunks in which the lumberjacks slept when in camp  the sound  of voices came to frank  who was watching outside  and looking down  the crooked road he caught sight of the wagon  with the two colored  men on the seat     a shout brought jerry plunging out of the door  and he joined in noisily  greeting the coming of the team     it had been previously arranged that he was to take erastus on his  machine over to the station on the railroad  about two miles away   so that he might get the afternoon local  which would stop upon  being flagged     meanwhile  frank would escort the wagon to the camp  feeling quite able  to take good care of the supply train  as jerry called it  when he tired  of saying  chuck wagon      jerry got away first  with erastus perched behind him  and grinning from  ear to ear with the novelty of the experience      h m  he won t think it so funny if they strike a root and take a header   but then jerry s a cautious driver  and he knows something of the lay of  the land  so i hope they ll get along without a spill  now  uncle toby   do you think you can stand a mile or two of rough sledding  for the   tote road  is hardly meant for a wagon with springs   frank asked  as  the other vanished from sight  going back along the way they had come  from centerville       deed an  i specks i kin  marse frank  dis chile is able to stan  a  heap o  knockin   round on  casion  s long as i keeps my shins safe  i  don t seem to keer  bout much else  say de word  sah  an  i se ready to  hit um up ag in right peart   was the reply from the old  gray headed  toby  who had worked for frank s father many years  indeed  he was fond  of saying he had been a slave in the virginia branch of the langdon  family  befo  de wah      the horses had not had a very hard pull up to this time  and were   therefore  in pretty fair condition to attempt the last quarter of  the journey     and they needed all their strength to drag that heavily laden wagon over  the half broken road  where so many obstacles stuck up to jolt the poor  driver until he almost lost his grip on the seat  though the boys had  been able to avoid most of these because they could steer aside with the  single line of wheels     but the vehicle had been well made  and the horses were full of vim   while the venerable black man who gripped the reins was a  sticker   as  he expressed it  after being once tossed out upon the back of the near  horse by the sudden stoppage of the wagon     after rather a trying experience they finally sighted a column of smoke   and  calling toby s attention to this  frank said      that s as far as we go this time  toby      toby shut his eyes for a brief moment and doubtless gave thanks  for his  poor old body must have been pretty well bruised by this time     will and bluff had spied the wagon by now  and they shouted a  noisy welcome      now we re prepared for a siege  with the grub at hand   cried bluff   dancing around with his gun held on high      say  be careful with that contraption  will you  if ever it started  going off not one of us would live to tell the ghastly tale   called  will  as if really and truly alarmed  which  of course  he was not     bluff gave him an indignant look  for it pained him to have his pet  gun insulted after this rude fashion  but he was too much delighted  over the coming of the supply wagon to cherish any animosity  and  besides  as frank said  he never could keep on being angry over a few  minutes at a time     such fun they had getting that vehicle unloaded     then the tents had to go up  which was an operation that consumed  considerable time  for frank proved to be very exact in his way of  arranging things  and would not accept any poor work     when finally both tents had been erected  with a burgee bearing the club  name floating from the very tops  the camp began to have a mighty cheery  look that was invigorating     then another fly was put up just in the rear  under which some of the  coarser provisions  such as water would not injure should the rain get  in  were stored  here  too  toby was to bunk while in camp      everything looks like business  boys   said jerry  as he came in later      what did you do with erastus   demanded frank   upset him in a ditch       do i look like i had been rooting  he got off on the train  and is  home by now      home  the boys looked at each other  for it already seemed as though  they had been away a long time  and yet their first night under canvas  was still ahead     they meant to keep the horses with them over night  and next day jerry  would go with toby to the farmer s  about a mile off  leaving the outfit  there until it was needed to take them back again     as evening came on the boys began to lie around and watch the old darkey  start operations for supper  which he did with evident delight  for toby  loved nothing better than to get away with  marse frank  and some of his  friends  where he could wait upon them and enjoy a holiday in the woods     the unusual exertions of the ride and subsequent wood chopping had really  tired all of the chums  though none of them would publicly admit it  when  bluff attempted to get up in a hurry for some purpose  he found himself  so stiff he could hardly move  and it was only after much grunting and  three distinct efforts that he finally managed to reach his feet     frank only smiled     he had expected just this  and knew that in a few days the boys would  have succeeded in getting the kinks out of their muscles     bluff had insisted that they have fried onions with that glorious  steak  and  indeed  he even prepared a dozen of the same himself  for  bluff could be very persistent when he chose  frank called a halt at  this number      we may want a few another time  old fellow   he admonished      oh  all right  then  i was just waiting till somebody called me off   i ve shed more tears than brutus ever dropped at the bier of caesar  wow   some kind person wipe my eyes  please  my hands are too rank to touch my  tear rag   he declared  and will performed this friendly office  thinking  that he deserved it after his heroism     the coffee was soon bubbling on the fire  and the delightful odor of that  fine sirloin steak  together with a second frying pan full of onions  so  permeated the surrounding atmosphere that had any of the lasher crowd  been hiding in the vicinity they must have suffered tortures in the  thought that they were debarred from that glorious outdoor feast around  the first campfire      look there   said jerry  quietly  pointing as he spoke      it s a little chipmunk come to find out what all this row is about  here   remarked frank  tossing a piece of bread toward the cunning  animal   if you don t do anything to frighten them away we can have a  lot of such friendly creatures hanging around the camp all the time       then  for goodness  sake  chain up that annihilator of bluff s before he  gets it working overtime  looks as if he had an eye on it just now  for  game is game to the pot hunter  no matter how he gets it  or what it  happens to be   growled jerry  scowling in the direction of the other   who only grinned in reply      supper am ready  gemmen  kindly draw yer seats  round de table    announced the tow headed cook at this juncture  and in the eagerness  to appease their keen hunger everything else was forgotten for the  time being     two collapsible tables had been brought along  and these were placed  under the raised fly of one of the tents  so that the warmth of the open  fire could be enjoyed  but the whole supper had not been cooked after the  old fashion  for frank had a little outfit that burned kerosene  making  its own blue flame  and which the other boys declared to be the finest  thing of the kind they had ever seen     a set of aluminum ware went with it  the kettles nesting in each other   there were cups  dishes  knives  forks and spoons for four persons   besides  frank had added a lot of kitchen things from the house  so that  they were amply supplied     the supper was almost finished when something crashed through the  branches of a tree and fell at frank s feet      what s that   exclaimed the boy     crash  came another object  it landed on a platter and bounded off into  bluff s lap      a rock  somebody is throwing rocks at us   cried will  starting to  scramble to his feet in wild excitement      it must be one of that lasher crowd   ejaculated jerry   come on  boys   and let s get hold of the fellow            chapter vi    bluff meets with a loss      the wildest excitement ensued     jerry met with a mishap right in the beginning of the hunt  falling over  the long box in which much of their camp material had been carried     it happened to lie just back of the tent  empty save for a few fag ends  of canvas brought along in case of need  and with the cover in place      talk about your obstacle races   he shouted  as he scrambled up  and  went limping after the others   this has  em beaten to a frazzle      the hunt for the offender was without result  he had evidently made haste  to scuttle off  after heaving the stones at the camp     frank and will  after searching for some little time  started to return  to the camp  and on the way overtook bluff      where s jerry   asked frank  as they joined forces      don t know   came the answer  as bluff pushed on eagerly ahead   last  i saw of him he was taking a header over that long coffin box back of  the tents       i hope he didn t hurt himself badly  that s all  what s your hurry   bluff   continued frank  noticing that the other seemed particularly  anxious to get along      why  i left my gun standing against a tree   replied bluff      well  we all did about the same thing  i forgot i had a gun  in fact   being so anxious to get my hands on that chump who bombarded our camp  i  guess you ll find the gun safe  uncle toby stayed in camp   said frank   nudging will      he did not  i saw him scooting off like a scared dog  like as not that  coon is hiding somewhere under the bushes at this very minute    declared bluff     at which both the others laughed     presently the cheery blaze was seen through the trees     some one was there  for they could see him bending over as though  busily engaged      it s jerry  all right   said bluff  over his shoulder      but what in the wide world is he doing  i believe he s been hurt  boys    declared frank  with a touch of anxiety in his voice  for jerry and he  had been very thick of late      binding a bandage around his shin  as sure as you live  hello  what  happened to you  old fellow  did one of those rocks hit home  or was it  the box you tried to capture that jumped up and kicked you   asked will     bluff was in the meantime rushing wildly about the camp as though looking  for something      i tumbled over that plagued box  that s all  and after limping around  for a spell thought i d better come back and put some witch hazel on the  bruise   explained the other  turning down his trousers  leg  and  scrambling to his feet to ascertain how well he could walk      it will be some stiff in the morning  i reckon  talk about your bears   i thought one had me nailed when i fell over that thing  ker chunk    he  continued  as he rubbed his shin and screwed his face up as if to  conceal his pain      i told you so  it s gone   shouted bluff  at this juncture      what s gone   echoed will      my gun  something seemed to tell me it was a silly thing for me to run  off in that way and leave it  and now they ve stolen it   wailed bluff      what  do you really mean to say you can t find it   questioned frank      help me look  fellows  oh  my heart will be broken if it s true  i was  just dreaming of what great things i meant to do with that splendid  repeating shotgun  please search around the camp   pleaded bluff     of course they immediately started a thorough hunt for the strangely  missing weapon  even the limping jerry seeming as deeply interested in  the search as any one of his comrades     high and low they looked  turning over all the blankets in the tents  but  not a sign of the wonderful  pump gun  could they discover     the other guns were just where they had been left  and so far as they  could see not another thing had been stolen      i declare  this is mighty queer   remarked frank  when they were ready  to give over the quest      strangest thing i ever heard of   declared will      talk about your airships  i think the blooming old thing must have taken  wings and sailed away   grunted jerry  still rubbing his wounded shin  sympathetically      but why should they pick out bluff s gun of the lot   demanded frank      that s easy enough to answer  they knew a good thing when they saw it   i bet that crowd noticed what a bully gun i carried  when we passed them  on the road  and they ve been hanging around ever since   avowed bluff   positively      then the rocks    began will     were fired at us only to tempt a rush  it was all a plot  fellows  to  coax us away for a short time  and the worst of it is the game worked  only too well  i ll never get over that loss  never  i feel sick    went on bluff     he kept shaking his head as if working himself up into a desperate frame  of mind  evidently it would have gone hard with any one of andy lasher s  crowd if the offended boy could have laid hands on him just then      i wonder if uncle toby could give us any information on this subject    suggested frank      oh  call him in and see  perhaps he even grabbed it up in his fright   shout to him  frank  please   exclaimed bluff  eagerly      hello  uncle toby  show up here  the coast is clear  and all  danger past      placing his hands about his mouth  after the fashion of a megaphone   frank shouted these words several times      there he comes   cried will  pointing to a moving object      has he got anything in his hands   gasped bluff  anxiously      not that i can see   replied the other     bluff groaned and wrung his hands disconsolately      it s gone  boys  i ll never set eyes on that beauty again  might as well  give up and go back to town   he said  gloomily  as if brokenhearted      oh  shucks  don t give up so easy  bluff  who knows but that we may find  a chance to recover the gun again  sooner or later  live in hopes       it s easy for you to say that  frank  when your gun is all safe and  sound  why  what can i do now without anything to shoot game with       well  i wouldn t worry about that  this is kamp kill kare  you know   trust us to find plenty for you to do  there ll be fish and game to  clean  and dishes to wash while toby is busy at something else  oh  you  can be useful all right  i give you my word  bluff   said frank  gaily     the aggrieved boy gave him one indignant look  he did not seem in a humor  to trust himself to speech     meanwhile the aged darkey had entered the camp      have you seen my repeating gun  toby   demanded bluff  striding  up to him       deed an  i hasn t seen any gun since i jumped into de bush to find dem  young raskils wot trowed dat stone at me  i war just a wishin  i had a  gun along  wouldn t i jest a peppered dem scalawags as dey run past me    replied the old fellow      say  did you see them then   demanded frank      i shore did  marse frank       how many were there   came the quick question      i war jest a countin  ob dem jailbirds  an  had  rived at  leven w en a   streperous root she keeled me ober  w en i gits up agin dey had gone   den i heard marse frank a callin  me to come back   went on toby  glibly     the boys looked at each other and smiled  they knew that without doubt he  had been cowering close to the ground in mortal fear the whole time  for  uncle toby had little reputation for bravery      did you see any of them have a gun   asked bluff  faintly      i done t ink de whole bunch hab guns  least way dat was my  pression at  de time dat creeper done trip me up  it s lucky my haid is  customed to  hard knocks  or it split open for sure       that settles it  my new gun is gone  oh  it makes me so mad just  to think one of that crowd may be handling it   cried bluff   shaking his fist      i just fancy i can hear the squirrels laughing  and the little chippies  singing for joy   declared jerry   now they ll have a chance to live   what s hard on you  bluff  is just happiness to them       you always did envy me the possession of that gun  and i know it  in  spite of your sneers  you just thought i d beat you out in making a  record  wait  i m going to get that cracker jack gun back again  some  fine day   remarked bluff  grimly     and frank  seeing that look of determination on his face  knew he meant  it           chapter vii    the shack of the muskrat trapper       wake up  everybody      bang  bang  bang  went the big spoon on the frying pan frank held     as the others came crawling out of the tents they sniffed the air      say  that bacon smells prime   declared will  smacking his lips      hope you didn t forget about that mess of hominy i spoke about last  night  toby  hominy s my great stand by for breakfast  all right  i see  it on the fire  give me just five minutes  if it wasn t for that gun        talk about your ambrosia  that java sure has it knocked clean out    broke in jerry   me for a quick dressing act and then grub      uncle toby grinned  for he knew what appetites boys are apt to develop  when in the woods  and  of course  he had made allowances     they were soon gathered around the table and busy      what s the programme for to day   asked frank  when the edge of their  appetites had been taken away      first thing of all i want some snapshots of the camp in the morning sun   you can see that s the best time to get a good view  now  just sit still   fellows  and let me do my little trick   said will     they assumed grotesque positions  but the photographer refused to  stand for that      what d ye think i want  a collection of freaks broken loose from the  lunatic asylum  here  you  will  be dishing out some more bacon on to  your plate  frank  take up the coffee pot and be helping bluff  uncle  toby  just look pleasant       pretend you found my gun  and i was giving you half a dollar  uncle  toby   remarked bluff  quickly      always thinking of that cheap  clap trap affair   growled jerry    goodness knows if we ll hear anything else from him all the time we re  in camp  i declare i ve half a notion        to do what   asked frank  looking at him suspiciously     jerry only smiled and shrugged his shoulders      now  hold your positions  fellows  frank  lean a little forward  so your  face stands out better  there  that s right  toby  raise your head and  point up as if you saw a bird in that tree  that s good  all right  it s  over  thank you      will kept his position for a little while  and every few minutes seemed  to find a chance to snap off another view  he evidently believed in  getting a variety of the main subject of their outing  the home camp      i move we try and find old jesse wilcox this morning   suggested frank      that suits me  if we don t have to go too far   agreed jerry      how s the shin  by the way  this morning  haven t noticed you  limp much       feels pretty fair  next time i chase out of camp i m going to make sure  to clear that old box  all right  how about the rest  do you say go    asked jerry      count me in   called will      yes  you will want to get some views of the old trapper and his cabin   with the door covered with muskrat skins   remarked frank      coming along  bluff   asked jerry  watching the other covertly      i guess not to day  i m going to hunt around again to see if i could  have unconsciously grabbed up that gun as i bolted  and then dropped it  in the brush  such a thing might happen  you know  fellows   returned  the other     so he remained behind when the other three sallied forth  frank and  jerry carrying their guns over their shoulders  while will brought up the  rear bearing his camera ready for use and on the lookout for subjects      if you see any game please give me a chance to snap a view before you  shoot   he pleaded  at which the others laughed      perhaps  but we can t promise  if a partridge got up suddenly it would  be a case of shoot first  and think afterwards   said frank      but if it should be a deer standing feeding       or a black bear on his hind legs begging   jeered jerry      all right  i m going to be ready for all that comes along  still life   if i have to  or anything else      will s last words were drowned in the report of jerry s gun  he had swung  it around like a flash  and without apparently glancing along the  barrels  fired one charge at something that was flashing through the  undergrowth     there came a second shot  so close upon the heels of the first that the  reports were almost blended in one     jerry turned and looked reproachfully at frank      talk about your sporting blood  you sure wiped my eye that  time   he said      the bird was a little too close for your shot to scatter  i had a better  chance as it flew away farther  you d have dropped him with your second  barrel  i reckon  old fellow   cried frank  hurrying forward to pick up  the partridge      yes  i ve no doubt i would  but that s the first time i ever had any  one step in and beat me clean  i ll have to watch out for you after  this  you sly  possum  but then you ve shot lots of these birds up in  maine  i suppose       plenty of them  but up there they light in trees  and the natives don t  hesitate to drop them while they sit       that s little short of murder   said jerry     after an hour s walk they reached the camp of old jesse      there it is  boys   said frank  pointing ahead      and he s home  too  something i hardly expected at this time of day    from jerry   because if he has a line of traps the morning is the time he  tends them  i m told      as they approached  the man in the camp turned and saw them  he was a  tall and angular fellow  well on in years  and with keen eyes that seemed  always looking for signs around him      say  boys  this here is right nice o  you  comin  to look me up  out on  a leetle hunt to day   he asked  as he shook hands all around      we ve come up to camp out for a couple of weeks  while repairs are made  to the school building  damaged in the gale of wind   answered frank      sho  ye don t say  well  now  that s fine  i ll be right glad to see  sumpin  o  ye while around  whar s the camp  jerry       at the spring under the twin hemlocks  we wanted to run over and see  how you were getting on  started to put out your traps yet  jesse    asked the other      oh  i got a few in line  season s a bit early yet  ye see  bringing in  some musquash   and he swept his hand around at a dozen wooden frames  upon which the skins were drying in the shade      please let me get a picture of you at work  just as you were when we  came up   said the ambitious photographer  keen on the subject that  interested him most     the trapper grinned good naturedly      fire away  then  so long as i don t give away any o  my secret ways o   preparin  the pelts  i don t keer  i m some proud o  that shack  too   sheds the rain  an  kin be kept warm easy  what more do a feller want    he observed     the operation was speedily completed      hope you feel better now you ve got that out of your system    said jerry      i have five more exposures on this roll of film  boys  hope to get  something worth while before we start back to camp   retorted will   caressing his new camera      where do you get the muskrats  jesse   asked frank  as he bent down to  examine the way in which each skin was carefully stretched out on its  little frame      along the edge o  the swamp half a mile off  they s jest rafts o   em  thar  as a rule the pelts bring about fifteen cents each  but jest now  thar s quite a boom on  an  i reckon i ll git sixty apiece       that s fine  what else do you catch here in season   asked jerry      wall  a few mink  not many  once in a long while an otter  fur which i  git twenty dollars  then i caught three bobcats last winter  seven foxes   eleven  coon  half a dozen  possums  an  two black b ars  though one o   them i shot arter we had a right lively argyment       whew  then there  are  bears around here   asked will  eagerly   what  wouldn t i give to get a picture of one in its wild state      the old man laughed      kinder risky business a shootin   that  thing at a b ar   specially a  she b ar as has young uns nigh  like as not she d rush ye  now  i got a  skin here with the head on it  an  if it comes to the wust we might rig  that up  natural like  so ye cud git a picter o  a wild an  ferocious  beast coming at ye on his hind legs       oh  i hope i won t have to descend to a fake like that  but we ve come  to put in the day with you  jesse  show us how you set your traps   won t you       sartin i will  was jest startin  out for a turn when ye showed up  so  s pose ye drop in line  it won t take more n an hour or two  boys      they were delighted at the chance  will lugging his camera along  though  the old trapper cast a dubious eye on the affair  as if he did not wholly  like the idea of visiting his traps with such a  contraption   something  unheard of in his experience      now  don t even whisper  fellers  here s the swamp and my traps begins  clost by  i ll show ye all about it by signs  dumb trappers is most  successful  they sez   remarked jesse  holding up his hand     the three boys followed close at his heels  each picking his way  and  walking on his tiptoes  as though that would make any difference     so they entered the edge of the swamp     suddenly the man came to a halt and stooping  pointed ahead      looky yonder   he whispered hoarsely   that s somebody stealing out o   my traps            chapter viii    where is bluff        where   gasped will  making as if anxious to get a snapshot of the thief  in the very act      keep quiet   whispered frank  giving him a push     there was some one bending over the edge of the water  for they could  catch a glimpse of his back      stay here an  watch me scare the critter   said old jesse  with a frown     he glided forward  very like an indian brave creeping up on his enemy   whoever the offender might be  he seemed to have no suspicion that danger  hung over his head     suddenly the trapper jumped forward  and the boys saw him seize his prey      wow  talk about your wildcats springing  that was a corker      jerry led the way forward  though hard put to it to keep ahead of his  eager companions  anxious to assist the trapper if he needed help      take that  you pelt thief  and that  let me ketch ye at my traps agin  an  i ll jest waste a bullet on one o  yer legs  kim up here an  steal my  skins  will ye  thar s another fur ye  oh  howl all ye want to  i m  larnin  ye a lesson      the hearty kicks with which he punctuated this speech brought forth a  whoop of pain from the recipient on each occasion      why  it s pet peters   exclaimed frank     there was a snap      thank you   cried will  with a satisfied grin  he had succeeded  in taking a snapshot of the struggling couple while their faces  were exposed      it ll do as evidence when i want ter send this critter to jail  which  i ll sartin do if he ever comes a foolin   round my traps agin  i bet  that snake bud rabig set him up ter it  skeered to come hisself  an   sends a boy  now  you git      this time the kick was so tremendous that it actually lifted andy  lasher s crony clear off his feet  and started him in a mad flight along  the edge of the swamp  as he ran wildly he kept bellowing in pain  and  holding both hands back of him     the temptation was more than will could stand  and another  click   announced that he had secured a second retreating view of the poacher      at this rate i ll soon have my six rolls done   he announced   triumphantly      what harm did he do   asked frank     the trapper made an investigation      jest ketched him in time  ye see he bed got the game outen the steel   an  was tryin  to sot the trap again so as i wouldn t know it  that  proves he was sent up here by that sneakin  bud rabig  fur what would the  boy know about fixin  a trap if he didn t git guided      jerry picked up the drowned muskrat and examined it      pretty soft fur it has  lots of it used nowadays i understand    he observed      yas  but mostly under other names  fur is a gittin  skeercer all the  time  an  they hev to come to stuff they used to larf at  now watch me  sot her  boys      they were all interested in the manner in which the trap was set  for  much care and ingenuity is required in order to outwit the cautious  instincts of the animal  though muskrats are not half so timid as some  other animals whose fur is coveted by the trappers      now fur the next trap  hope i don t find a thief has be n thar too    said jesse     evidently pet peters had just started in to follow up the line of traps   as described to him by bud rabig the rival of old jesse  for they saw no  more evidences of a visit     when an hour had passed they were carrying five victims of the  steel traps     jerry did not much fancy the business     he tried to be a thorough sportsman all the time  and anything that  savored of the habits of a game butcher  or trapping and shooting for the  market  grated on his nerves     after this jesse led them to where he had a bear trap located  and here  they were compelled to exercise considerable caution  because bruin is a  suspicious beast  and easily frightened away     but the trap was not sprung  and jesse from a little distance explained  to his young friends how it lay concealed under the fallen leaves at a  place where he knew a bear frequented in passing to and fro      i m goin  to look up his den in a few days  before he shuts in fur the  winter  an  sot my trap  whar he s jest bound to tread in it goin  or  comin   now  if so be ye feels that way  let s git back to camp an  hatch  up some sorter dinner ever eat musquash  boys       what  eat muskrats   exclaimed jerry  in disgust      i never have  but would like to try the dish   remarked frank   up in  maine the trappers told me they were fine in winter weather      will said not a word  but his lip curled  as though nothing could tempt  him to even take a taste of such a queer dish     it was high noon when they arrived at the shack of the old trapper  and  all of the boys felt sharp pressed with hunger      i hope he s got something else besides muskrat  ugh   said jerry to  will      i saw part of a deer hanging up before we left here   replied the other     jerry licked his lips in anticipation      venison  real venison  fresh in the woods  tell me about that  will you   i m in on that deal every time  i hope he cooks enough of it      there was little danger of the trapper allowing any of his guests to  go hungry      boys  i want you all to help me git a fine dinner  frank  i knows you  are used to makin  up a good cookin  fire  you  tend to that part  jerry  see that ere haunch o  venison hangin  from the limb o  that  tree  jest git her down an  cut off some slices  all this here big  fry pan ll hold  an  put some pieces o  salt pork in along with it    cause ye see venison is mighty dry  bill  p raps ye kin look arter the  coffee part o  the bizness      immediately everybody became busy     old jesse went away with a couple of the muskrats  and when he came back  later he had them skinned and ready for cooking  an operation the boys  watched with considerable uneasiness     finally the meal was ready  and they sat down     the venison tasted prime  and the coffee was pretty good  at least it was  hot  and on a cool day that counts for a good deal     jerry and will watched their comrade bravely take a portion of the  musquash      how is it   asked jerry  for there had not been enough of the venison  after all to appease their appetites      bully  just try for yourselves  i ve eaten much worse dishes right at  home   was the immediate reply of the stout hearted frank     old jesse chuckled and gave him a look of appreciation     thereupon both of the others took a very dainty help  and with much  hesitation tasted of the dish  but both came back for more  and in the  end pronounced the new dish all right      why  fellows   said frank  laughing   it was the same with terrapin  years ago  people along the eastern shore used to consider the  diamond back as common as dirt       so i was reading the other day   admitted jerry      yes  sir  so common that when men hired out they stipulated in the bond  that they were not to be fed on terrapin  then the fashionable people  took a fancy for the dish  the supply ran low  and now a decent sized  terrapin is worth five dollars  perhaps muskrats may become popular the  same way  who knows   laughed frank     at which the trapper roared  seemingly thinking it a great joke     he showed them how he took the skins off  and stretched them on  his frames      not too tight  boys  and then keep  em in the open air in the shade   away from the fire  till they gits right dry  some we take off whole  an   others is slit up  jest accordin  to the kind      all this sort of thing was eagerly listened to  especially by frank and  jerry  always interested in everything that pertained to hunting and  wild animals     will had his mind bent upon one subject  and could not bear to think of  anything else  in camp and out  he kept his eyes on the alert for  subjects suitable for striking pictures with which to embellish his  account of the outing trip     so the afternoon began to wane almost before they were aware of it      time we were making tracks for home  fellows   announced frank      what will bluff and toby think has become of us  i wonder    said will      him  why  he s forgotten we re in existence  he can never get that jay  gun out of his mind  talk about your phonograph  he s sure the worst  repeater i ever heard  and that s no fairy story   grunted jerry      well  come along boys  jesse  you must run over and have dinner with us  some afternoon  we dine at night  you see  will you come   asked frank   shaking hands      i sartin will  and soon at that  glad ye thought  bout the ole lone  trapper  boys  come agin  soon  an  any time  an   bill  when ye git them  picters printed remember i m in one  an  that pelt thief  too       i ll see you get copies of both  good by   called out will     they trudged back with less ambition to make time than when on the  morning tramp  for all of them were feeling a little stiff  as they came  in sight of the home camp  jerry broke out with      say  she looks some nice  with the two tents standing there  and old  toby working around       do you see bluff   asked frank  a trifle uneasily      why  no  but what makes you say that       i ve got a suspicion about him  that s all hello  toby  everything  all right       sho  marse frank  eberything am lubly an  de goose hangs high       how about bluff  where is he       don t no nuffin   bout dat boy  he went off in de mornin  an  ain t  kim back       just what i feared  fellows   said frank   that silly chap has gone  hunting up the camp of the lasher crowd  and like as not got himself  in trouble            chapter ix    jerry takes chances      the announcement of frank stunned both the others for a moment      do you really believe that   asked will  uneasily  at length      it would be just like bluff to take chances  he never counts the cost   yes  sir  i just wager he started for that camp before we had been gone  half an hour       but how would he know where to find those fellows   asked will      oh  he knew  all right  we talked it over last night when you were busy  with your camera  after we chased around for the stone thrower  and  agreed that since andy and his mates couldn t get this camp site  the  next best place for them to go would be that little cabin up near the  shore of the lake   said jerry      you mean the one the charcoal burners used to live in long ago       yes  and as bluff has been around this section more than once  he must  have known how to get there  five to one he burst right into the camp and  demanded his gun       do you think so   said jerry  uneasily      that is his way  and you can just guess that he got into hot water  before half a minute had gone   returned frank      would they hurt bluff   asked will  beginning to show unexpected  feeling      well  they might  especially if he accused them of stealing his gun   besides  if he happened to see it there i wouldn t put it past bluff to  tackle the whole bunch in the effort to get his property   frank went on     jerry had thrown his gun down as if ready to drop over himself  he now  stooped and picked it up again      come on  fellows  there s only one thing for us to do   he said      and that s to hike over to that shanty and find out if they ve got our  chum there a prisoner   finished frank     will made no move to leave his beloved camera behind      hide it somewhere   suggested frank   for it will be too dark by the  time we get across to their camp to take a picture decently       i guess not   observed the other  calmly   you see i m prepared to snap  off a flashlight picture at any old time  here s after you  frank      uncle toby had witnessed this threatened exodus with signs of alarm      whar ye gwine  marse frank  ain t  spectin  to leab dis chile erlone  hyah be yuh  i doan t like dem owls a whoopin  dar in de big timber  an   i sure reckons dar might be bars an  wildcats a snoopin  round dis yer  camp ter night       we expect to be back before a great while  uncle toby  just be getting  supper ready for us in an hour or so  and have a good fire  wild beasts  will never trouble any one when backed by a blaze  remember  so long      when they looked back  they could see the ancient darkey gazing with  longing glances  as if he might be tempted to chase after them      do you think bluff can be in trouble   asked jerry  showing real  solicitude in his voice and manner      i m a little afraid of it  and i want to say right here that both of you  have shown the right spirit in agreeing to come with me so quickly  it  does you credit  boys   remarked frank     will seemed to puff up a bit under the compliment  but jerry sneered      oh  i don t consider that anything at all  bluff is a good fellow in  spite of his butcher instincts  and i guess he d go out of his way to  help me   he said     frank looked at him  and opened his mouth to speak  but on second thought  changed his mind     jerry seemed to know more about the woods than either of his chums  he  had little trouble in guiding them across the territory that separated  the rival camps  which was not more than a mile or so      i can see the glow of a fire ahead   announced will  presently      that s the place we re aiming for  the lake lies beyond  i ve fished  from the point many a time   pursued jerry      and when are we going to try for fish  i brought my rod and lines along   thinking we d have a fish dinner some fine day   complained will      wait  there s plenty of time  the season is nearly over  but if a warm  day comes along we ought to be able to get some bass  i think   remarked  frank  who was something of an authority in that line      i can see figures moving about like black ghosts   announced jerry    say  fellows  this is getting real exciting  creeping up on a rival  camp with the intention of holding up the whole kit at the muzzle of  our guns       oh  i hope it won t come to such a desperate point as that  i d  rather not have any trouble with that lasher if it can be avoided    ventured frank      but if they ve got our chum tied to a tree a prisoner   demanded jerry      in that case we ll make sure that he s set free  no matter what the  consequences   was the immediate response from the leader     as they drew nearer to the fire they could begin to make out the identity  of those who were moving about     andy lasher could be easily seen  as he always took it upon himself to be  the high pin of any gathering of the clans in which he moved  then there  was the fellow who had been caught stealing from the traps of jesse  wilcox that morning  still limping painfully whenever he walked     besides these two there were five other boys present     a tough looking bunch   muttered jerry  as he trailed along after frank      i don t see anything of bluff  though   whispered the other  over  his shoulder      perhaps they ve got him inside the cabin  if you two would agree  to stay here  i ll volunteer to creep up back of it and find out    said jerry      you re all right  old fellow  just the kind to tie to   replied frank      oh  i don t know  any one of you would do the same for me  besides   i guess  but then  it doesn t matter  will you wait here  boys    asked jerry      draw a little closer  then let will have your gun while you re away      jerry handed it over a little regretfully  indeed  he had calculated on  carrying the weapon himself  though it must have been in the way     they saw him creep off     for quite some little time they watched  ready to rush forward if any  sound announced that jerry had been discovered  and was in trouble      they re getting supper  don t look like our outfit  does it   whispered  will  as he and frank crouched there in the brush  waiting and watching      i should say not  still  the appetite is the main thing in the woods  a  hungry man can forgive anything  look behind the shack  isn t that  something moving      what frank had said was true  for just then jerry crept across an open  space  and for a few seconds they saw him plainly     then he daringly slipped in through the open door of the cabin   doubtless taking advantage of the attention of the campers being turned  elsewhere      come on  move up a little  i m too nervous now to stay quiet    said frank     while they were thus advancing there suddenly arose a tremendous clamor   it appeared to issue from the interior of the dilapidated cabin in which  andy s crowd had taken up their quarters      oh  what has happened now   exclaimed will  scrambling to his feet      look   cried frank     something came flying out of the door of the shack  and landing in a heap  rolled over and over  clawing at every object within reach     then it sat up and looked around in a frightened way      why  it s ben cooper   said will  partly relieved      and he s met up with jerry   added frank  grimly  as he watched eagerly  to see what else took place in the little opening where the camp had  been pitched     the boys were all on their feet  they seemed to be staring at their  half dazed comrade as though hardly able to grasp the real meaning of the  conditions     then andy gave a shout      hey  you fellers  look at that door go shut  the prisoner must have got  loose  how about it  ben cooper  what happened to you       they s another feller in there  sides the prisoner  he knocked me  clean silly  and threw me out o  the door   whined the other  rubbing  his head dismally      who was it  any of that crowd from over by the hemlocks   demanded andy   much excited  and apparently ready to tear up things generally      i reckon  twar that jerry wallington  wait till i gets him some day   that s all       hey  fellers  d ye hear that  another of that lot bagged in the cabin   come on  an  we ll do him up   yelled the brawny leader  rushing forward     when he reached the door  he tried in vain to break it open  it  seemed to be braced in such a manner that he could make no impression  on the planks      bring me the ax  somebody   he howled  after beating his fists vainly  against the panel     one of his followers made haste to obey  when andy was aroused in this  way the bravest of them did not dare brook his anger     he immediately swung the implement about his head     crash  went the ax into the door  which began to split under the  vigorous assault  as though unable to stand long before such tactics      he ll do it  he s going to break his way in  and i ve got jerry s gun   oh  dear what shall we do   exclaimed will      stop that chopping  you   shouted frank  running forward with  raised gun           chapter x    uncle toby flies high       here  don t shoot   shouted andy  dodging behind one of his companions      we surrender   cried another  throwing up his hands     frank and will looked very threatening as they advanced  both of them had  their guns leveled  and besides  the latter was encumbered with his  camera  so that he presented the appearance of being fairly loaded down  with war material      hey  jerry  open up   called frank     the door of the shack immediately began to move  and presently it was  shoved aside  with the ax still sticking in its planking  just as andy  had left it      talk about your rescue parties  say  don t this take the cake    exclaimed a familiar voice  and jerry s head was thrust out of the  opening      is bluff there   demanded frank      sure   came in the voice of their missing chum     a second head had by this time shown up      hey  you  franky boy  what d ye mean bombarding our camp in this way   what have we done to your crowd  i d like to know  to be treated like  dogs  first there was that bluff masters a walkin  in here an  accusing  us of stealing his blamed old gun  when the only one we ve got is a  musket pet owns  now you come tearing up things      andy was evidently getting indignant  but all the same he kept on the  watch  and whenever he thought he saw one of those weapons pointing in  his direction he slipped quietly behind one of the others      that s all right  bluff has lost his gun  somebody took it from our camp  last night just after a shower of rocks came in on us and we rushed out  to find the fellow who sent them  he thought it was one of your crowd   and i guess he came over to ask  what business had you tying him up like  a convict  tell me that      frank put this to him sternly  at the same time he beckoned to jerry to  make a start out of the cabin  which the other easily understood  and set  about obeying      why  the silly fool was for trying to lick the whole lot of us  said as  how he knew somebody from here had swiped his old gun  and that unless we  handed it over he d show us  say  we couldn t stand for that  so we just  sailed in and made him a prisoner  we didn t hurt him much  no more than  he did us  suppose the lot of you clear out now  and let us alone    growled andy  growing bolder      which we will be only too glad to do  we only wanted to get bluff back      there was a sudden brilliant flash  and a shout of alarm from the boys  about the front of the charcoal burners  cabin      got it all right  and i bet it s a dandy   exclaimed will     he had set down jerry s double barreled shotgun when he saw what he  considered a good chance to get a picture of the group  and touched off  the little cartridge that allowed him to snatch a flashlight picture     two or three of andy s fellows threw themselves flat on the ground  under  the impression that some one had fired at them  still more of them were  trying to hide behind each other in alarm      hey  take that feller away  won t you  he s sure enough to scare anybody  out of a year s growth   shouted andy  waving his arms excitedly     but he knew better than to try and rush forward while frank stood guard   there seemed to be an air of determination about that individual that  andy did not fancy     by this time jerry and bluff had joined their chums     the latter did not seem any the worse for his long confinement  indeed   he was grinning as though the scare of his enemies over that flashlight  had amused him      we re only too willing to go  i told you before that we didn t mean to  have any trouble with you  if we could help it  but if you start the ball  rolling look out       yes   said will  on the heels of what frank had said   it s a case of  millions for defense  not one cent for tribute       good night  fellows  and thank you for the grub you gave me   laughed  bluff  as he waved his hand mockingly toward the group     jerry had recovered his gun  and  in a bunch  the four chums walked away   the others followed them menacingly for a short distance  but every time  one of the two armed lads turned there was a sudden scattering  when will  whirled around and elevated his camera they fell flat to the ground as  though really alarmed      they ve turned back   announced jerry  presently      say  that was fine of you to come in there and rescue me   declared  bluff  as he caught hold of jerry s unwilling hand  and squeezed it     the other seemed to be unusually modest  for he pulled quickly away      beat it  bluff  you know you d have done the same for me  i guess i owed  you something for making fun of you so much  anyhow  it was just bully   that s what  talk about your earthquakes and cyclones  i don t think  anything could beat that scare you gave them with your old flashlight  stunt  will       and i reckon it s going to turn out a dandy picture  i just wanted to  get that crowd in some outlandish attitude  and if it proves what i  think  i ve done it       did they hurt you  bluff   asked frank      oh  well  they acted better than perhaps i had any reason to expect  we  mixed up some in the start  but they were too many for me       you mean the whole lot  well  i should guess yes  you had a sweet nerve  sauntering into that camp and taking them all on  accused them of  stealing  too  say  you don t know that they took your gun  do you    demanded frank      n  no  perhaps not   admitted bluff  hesitatingly      just surmise like  isn t it       but why that shower of stones if not to get us to run out of camp  so  that some one could sneak in and take a coveted article  and what more  natural than that my new repeater should be the thing they wanted   said  bluff  logically  as he believed      well  until you have found some stronger evidence than that  i d be a  little slow about accusing any of that crowd  eh  jerry   went on frank      that s right   admitted jerry  looking back just then as if he fancied  they might be followed  which  of course  was not the case      you didn t see any signs of the gun while there  did you   asked frank      no  i can t say i did  but then they wouldn t be likely to stick my own  property under my nose  would they  i could have them arrested later on  for robbery       all right  suppose we let the subject rest for a while  the gun may turn  up again  sooner or later  i have heard of just such queer freaks  happening in camp  now  who gets the first sight of our campfire  and  old toby cooking a glorious supper       wow  i can do justice to it all right  they gave me something to eat   but gracious  it was burned  and tasted horrible  not one in that crowd  knows the first thing about camp cookery  and they scorch everything they  try   said bluff  sighing      just keep up a little while longer  there  isn t that the fire through  that bunch of trees ahead       after all  you saw it yourself first  frank  that s the fire all right   straight this way  boys  and we ll be there in a jiffy   said will     they hurried on      i m looking to see good old toby  but somehow don t seem able to clap my  eyes on his honest  black face   declared bluff      that s a fact  where is he  the fire is burning decently  and from that  i judge he s around somewhere   remarked frank      well   broke in will   you know he acted as though afraid when we were  starting out  said something about the big owls in the timber getting on  his nerves       and the varmints prowling around  waiting for a chance to eat him up  i  believe the coon is hiding in one of the tents  afraid to show himself   how about that  frank  is he such a coward  demanded jerry     the other laughed      don t ask me   he replied  shaking his head   it isn t quite fair to  give poor old uncle toby away like that but we re getting close to the  camp now  and  if he is around  i ll soon raise him like i did before       if he s let that supper burn  something is going to happen to a  respectable colored gentleman i know   threatened bluff      listen to him  talk about your fighters  this bluff takes the cake  why   not satisfied with trying to whip the entire lasher crowd in a bunch  now  he wants to take on poor harmless old uncle toby washington low  perhaps  after all  it s just as well such a blood thirsty character has been  robbed of his little pump gun  why  he d have cleaned out the whole woods  community  given half a chance   jeered jerry      come now  let that drop  i m only joking  and you know it  i wouldn t  lay a single finger on old toby s white wool for worlds  but where is he   frank   said bluff      say  there s something in our camp  boys   ejaculated will  at  that moment      what s that   asked frank  his interest suddenly aroused      well  i saw something moving there  look now  there it is again  over  just beside the nearer tent   whispered will  in an awe struck voice     they all saw it now      keeps moving all the time  boys  it strikes me that it must be an animal  of some sort   came from the experienced frank      goodness gracious  i hope it hasn t devoured poor old toby    gasped will      well  make your mind up on that score  for it hasn t   yet   just look  aloft a bit  right above where the thing is jumping about as if worrying  something  what do you see astraddle that limb  eh   asked frank   triumphantly      talk about your treed coons  why that s old toby sitting up there  and  hanging on for dear life       and that object in the camp is  i believe  a wildcat  worrying over our  fine ham   remarked frank  quietly raising the hammers of his shotgun           chapter xi    a night alarm       oh  please don t shoot just yet  i m nearly ready   exclaimed will  who  had been fumbling with trembling fingers at his camera while they were  creeping closer      what do you want to do  shoot the cat with your machine   whispered  frank  the most accommodating fellow in the world      yes  that s it  don t you see  it would be the prize of the whole bunch   can t you let me give a flash  and shoot afterwards   begged the ardent  photographer     frank could not refuse      it would be a dandy all right  with old toby hanging there  but look  sharp  for the cat hears us whispering  and is ready to get out      hardly had he spoken before there came a brilliant flash      got him   shrieked the excited will     then came a heavy report close to his ears  as frank fired     the flash had dazzled all but frank  who managed to keep his eyes away  from it  he was thus enabled to catch sight of the startled wildcat  bounding for the shelter of the trees  having deserted its meal in  sudden fright     as soon as he had fired  frank threw his gun around so as to cover the  spot he expected the animal to occupy if by any chance it escaped the  full effect of his first charge     but it jumped the other way  and might have vanished from view only that  jerry fired from his hip  there being no time to aim from the shoulder      he s down   shouted bluff  as the fierce visitor in the camp rolled over  and over  clawing aimlessly as it expired     ready to shoot again if necessary  the two hunters cautiously advanced   there was no need of further attention  for the wildcat stiffened out  under their eyes      ginger  but ain t he a beaut   exclaimed bluff  bending over      i wonder if there happens to be a mate around   said jerry  as he bent  an anxious look toward the timber close at hand      they generally hunt in couples   admitted frank   but in this case i  hardly think it can be so  for the other would have come to the feast      uncle toby came down from his perch rather dubiously  as if he feared  that the danger might not be all over      what happened to you  uncle toby   asked frank  giving the others a wink  not to joke the old fellow too seriously  for he was still trembling      yuh see  twar dis way  marse frank  dat cat he jest wanted de ham more n  unc toby did  an  i naturally lets him hab it  he jumps down from de  tree  an  i feels a notion to elevate  bout dat time  don  know how i  gits up dar  but  spect i done fly   explained the cook  as well as his  chattering teeth would permit      he means he aviated upward   grinned jerry     will was patting his camera lovingly      oh  i do hope it turns out fine   he said   for that would be a jolly  hit  i d rather snap off pictures like that than shoot a grizzly or a  bull moose  me for the gentle life  i m no butcher       talk to me about that  will you  you re a sport all right  will  only it  happens that your tastes run in a different direction from mine  don t  knock my love of fair play  and i won t laugh at your wanting to snap off  every living thing you see  to make up a freak collection       all right  then  jerry  consider it a bargain  i suppose you ll have  a muff made out of this nice fur for somebody   continued will   stroking the cat      haven t given it a thought  besides  half of the honor belongs to  frank       what s that  i made a mess of it  and the beast would have escaped if  you hadn t shot him on the jump   exclaimed frank      and if you hadn t wounded him how could i have ever had a chance to  shoot  you can t get out of it  old man  we ll share the honors    returned jerry     frank said no more  but such generosity only drew him closer to his chum     fortunately the supper had not advanced far enough to be ruined  they  were able to save most of the ham  which was a comfort  frank declared  that he wondered at the beast taking to smoked pork  he could not  remember any similar circumstance in all his hunting  and concluded that  possibly the wildcat must have been unusually hungry     it had really been quite a strenuous day  and the boys were glad to  sit around the big fire and partake of the good supper which uncle  toby prepared     bluff had to relate his story again and again  but it differed little  from what he had already told      i made a silly fool of myself  i know now  and it was mighty fine in  you fellows coming to pull me out of the hole i dropped into  if that  andy has got my beautiful gun in his camp  he s smart enough to keep it  under cover  i never had even a peep at it  but just wait  i m going to  get that gun back if it takes all winter   declared bluff      he ll do it too  just mark me   observed frank  nodding to jerry     apparently the other was tired of hearing about that same gun  for he  only smiled and shrugged his shoulders     in the morning jerry tried his hand at skinning the game  he had  taken particular pains to notice just how old jesse wilcox did this  sort of thing  and  being a clever imitator  he managed to succeed  after a fashion     frank meanwhile had made a frame suitable to the size of the skin  and  upon this the hairy pelt was stretched  care being taken to keep it in  the shade  and not near the heat of the fire  while drying     later on in the day jerry and frank took a stroll through the woods  and  managed to bring back three partridge and several gray squirrels  frank  would not let toby cook the latter as the other wished      they are always tough for frying unless parboiled first  after skinning  and cutting up i always put the pieces in a pot  and boil until tender   then take them out  dry off  and put them in a hot pan in which several  pieces of salt pork have been first tried out  i think you ll say they re  all right when you get your teeth in them  fellows   he remarked     and they did     will managed to take a few views during the middle of the day  prowling  in the neighborhood of the camp  there was a pretty stream not far away   and it ran over rocks and between attractive banks  so that half a dozen  charming pictures presented themselves to the eyes of the artist     the fall had not advanced so far as to show signs of ice on the water   though there were times when the air was very crisp and frosty     bluff had remained in camp pretty much all day  he seemed uneasy  and  passed in and out of the tents frequently as though wondering what could  have happened to bring about such a mysterious disappearance of his  beloved gun     sitting by the fire for a time  he would conceive some idea  and jumping  to his feet hurry into the woods to search a particular spot where he  remembered having passed over on that never to be forgotten night     still  when the others returned in the afternoon there was the same look  of distress upon his face      talk to me about a pagan and his idols   said jerry  aside to frank    bluff has the whole show beaten  i never saw such a persistent  fellow  never       he ll never be happy till he gets it  jerry   remarked the other      then he deserves to have a bad time   declared jerry  tossing the bunch  of game down before will and uncle toby  who happened to be doing  something in common at the campfire     that night they had a royal feast indeed  it tasted all the better  because the squirrels and partridge had fallen to their own guns  and not  been basely purchased in the market  and doubtless their surroundings had  considerable to do with the enjoyment of the dinner     will took advantage of the darkness to get a new roll of films in  his camera      how many have you cracked off   asked jerry  noting his occupation      three rolls  so far  about half i brought  i expect to be careful from  now on  and try to get choice subjects  but i know i ll never find  another to equal that wildcat scene  oh  i hope it is a success    replied the enthusiastic photographer      so say we all   remarked frank   for it will chase the blues away many a  time  just to see the look on uncle toby s face  as he clung to that  friendly limb       gorry  but i was mighty glad tuh git my claws on dat limb  marse frank   wen i seed dem big yaller eyes a starin  at me  an  heerd dat yowlin   noise  my knees dey jest wobbled together  nevah could tell how i got up  dar  reckons as how you say am jest de truf  an  i  flew    exclaimed the  cook  able to laugh now at his adventure     they turned in early  for their rest had been broken on the preceding  night  and both the hunters were leg weary     the last sound frank remembered hearing was the mournful hooting of the  owls  the birds seemed to have a favorite roosting place not far away   and from time to time the tremulous sound of their calling drifted  through space     just how long he slept frank did not exactly know  he awoke with a  sneeze  and sat up  rubbing his eyes      what s the matter   exclaimed jerry  also starting out of a sound sleep      i don t know  why  the tent s full of smoke  the camp must be on fire   wake up  everybody      as the two lads came crawling out of the canvas they were startled to  discover a heavy pall of smoke rising all around them           chapter xii    the tell tale match safe       wake up  wake up      both frank and jerry shouted at the top of their strong voices  the  others came tumbling into view  and loud were their expressions of dismay  at the terrible sight that met their eyes      get busy here  every one  water wanted  and never mind your clothes      even while he was speaking frank jumped into action  the night air struck  home  and made him shiver  for he had just tumbled out from between the  snug folds of his blanket  but this was a time when delay might mean the  complete wiping out of the camp     will gave a whoop and immediately vanished again inside the tent  he had  not gone to rescue any of his clothes  nor did he even think of getting  into them  but when he reappeared it was with his camera hugged tightly  in his arms     meanwhile the others had set to work with a vim  there was fortunately  no wind  so that the fire had burned sluggishly  then again the late  storm had wet the dead leaves then on the ground  and they had not as yet  become thoroughly dry  so it took quite some time for them to get over  smouldering  and burst into a vigorous flame      we re getting it down  fellows  keep right along hitting it hard    called frank  cheerily     even old toby had appeared from under the fly where he slept  he had been  dreadfully scared at first  doubtless under the impression that the mate  to the dead bob cat had invaded the camp  intent on revenge  this feeling  soon gave way to the desire to see the camp saved  and he labored  faithfully with the rest     scattering the smouldering leaves  beating out the fire with any sort of  thing they could snatch up in their excitement  they managed to get the  flames under control after a little while     it had been a most exciting experience  however  bluff was swinging his  blanket vigorously  and thrashing the fire with it effectively  though he  might later on have some difficulty in getting rid of the smudges that  this process necessarily produced      victory   shouted jerry  when the last vestige of the fire had  gone under     bluff threw his blanket around his shoulders and strutted about with the  air of a conqueror      they have to get up early in the morning if they expect to beat us    he  said  proudly      talk about your hot times  that was a scorcher   cried jerry      but i m beginning to shiver now all right  and i advise every one to  crawl into his clothes in a hurry  then we can talk it over  it s a  mighty suspicious thing  that s what   remarked frank     they were only too glad to take his advice  and shortly after the four  gathered around the revived campfire to exchange opinions     they were a pretty smutty looking crowd  but jerry declared that those  marks were medals of honor      now  if we had all been like will here  and each rushed for his  possessions  the camp would have been a goner   he remarked  with a  reproachful look      that s all right  fellows  and under any other conditions i would have  been one of the first to assist  but i m the official photographer of the  expedition  and the guardian of those splendid films that must perpetuate  our camping trip  for posterity   he explained      hear  hear   cried frank      why didn t you lay the outfit down at a safe distance then  and help  fight the fire with us   demanded bluff      i guess i know enough to take warning from your sad experience  they  hooked your old gun  the next thing they ll be after will be my camera   no  sir  i hang on to that business through thick and thin  they ll have  to chloroform me to get my films away  and that s so       was it an accident   asked bluff  looking to frank for an opinion      what do you think  jerry   demanded the leader      it couldn t have been an accident  and i m dead sure of it   was  the reply      suppose you state your reasons then       first  we banked the fire down as usual before crawling into bed  then  there wasn t a particle of wind to scatter the sparks  and last  but not  least  those heaps of dead leaves were carried here  i happen to know  that place was just about bare last evening   replied the other   seriously     will uttered an exclamation of wonder and alarm      do you really mean to say that some fellows would be mean enough to try  and burn our camp   he asked      i wouldn t put it past that andy lasher  talk to me about your heathen   he s just about equal to any of  em  but don t you agree with me  frank       certainly i do  because i happen to have a strong bit of evidence which  i picked up out there close to the burning leaves      he held something up      a match box   exclaimed will      do any of you own that       pass it around  i never saw it before   declared jerry  as he handled  the little silver article in which several matches still remained      well  i have  then   remarked bluff  suddenly  as he stared at the  trophy   and just as i thought  here are two initials on it       what are they   asked jerry  showing excitement      h b       that doesn t cover any of andy s crowd  though   said jerry  seemingly  disappointed      the real owner of this match box is herman bancroft   announced  bluff   i ve had it in my hands more than once  you know i went with  him for a time       he wanted to join our rod  gun and camera club  but the black ball  dished his chances  perhaps herman was mad about that  perhaps he even  followed us up here  and has tried to get even   suggested will      that s hard to believe  for he isn t the bad fellow some people say  a  little wild  but with a good heart  i d rather believe he lost it  and  one of that crowd picked it up   said bluff  sturdily      that s just like you  bluff  standing up for a friend  well  i m rather  inclined to believe the same way  anyhow  it was a mighty mean dodge  if  that andy lasher keeps on he ll get in a peck of trouble sooner or later   why  for such a thing as this he deserves a peppering of shot at a  distance   said frank  indignantly      it was criminal  that s what  we might have been smothered in our beds    remarked bluff      or my camera might have been utterly destroyed   wailed will     old toby said nothing  but he cast many an anxious look around at the  adjacent trees  as if he had an idea lingering under his woolly pate that  in some way or other this new disaster might have a connection with the  shooting of the wildcat     things assumed a normal aspect after a while  and only for the scent of  burnt leaves no one would dream that the camp had come near destruction     but all the inmates of kamp kill kare slept  so to speak   with one eye  open  during the balance of that night     there was no further alarm     by the time breakfast had been disposed of they could look the matter  calmly in the face  and it no longer appeared in such a terrible aspect  as when they were scampering around in their pajamas fighting the flames  and smoke     the sun seemed unusually warm this morning  so will declared that he  meant to tramp over to the lake and try a little fishing  since they  would have small opportunity to do any of this when the cold winds  came again      i m on too   remarked bluff  moodily   a fellow without a gun is like a  fifth wheel to a wagon  useless in camp  let s make up some lunch  for  it s a long tramp  and we won t come home until late      jerry announced that he wanted to go over and have a further talk with  jesse wilcox  after which he might take a tramp in a new region  advised by the old trapper as opening a possible chance for big  game  perhaps a deer     frank declared he would stick to the camp  with such vicious characters  around  he secretly thought it hardly safe for all of them to go away   leaving old toby as the sole guardian  they had too much at stake  since  their pleasure would be destroyed if the camp were raided successfully     reaching the lake will spent much of his time taking views  while bluff  set to work trying to entice the finny denizens of the water to bite  his lures     as time went on he was fairly successful  and when they ate their lunch  he had quite a fair string of fish as the reward of his diligence     will proved to be a poor fisherman after all  especially when he had his  adored camera along  for he presently wandered off again      don t go too far   warned bluff  as he sat on the end of a log that  jutted out over the water a yard or more     engrossed with his sport  bluff hardly noticed how time passed  hearing a  step back of him  he called out      i got three more  what luck did you have  will      he heard what sounded like a chuckling laugh back of him  and before he  could turn some one gave him a strong push  bluff went over with a splash  into the lake           chapter xiii    the coming of the storm      bluff came up spluttering      help  help   he shouted  involuntarily  as well as a mouth half full of  water would permit     but there was no one in sight  whoever had shoved him into the lake had  mysteriously vanished  though a movement in the bushes told the direction  of his flight     recovering from the shock  bluff found that he could clamber out without  much difficulty  and he hastened to do so     his cries had been heard  however  for presently the sound of some one  running wildly came to his ears  and will burst into view     at sight of the dripping fisherman he broke into a shout      caught a tartar  did you  and he pulled you in  oh  what wouldn t i have  just given to have been here  a snapshot of you going over would have  been the finest ever       shut up  it wasn t a fish at all that yanked me overboard  somebody  gave me a shove   snapped bluff  beginning to shiver  in spite of the  fact that the air seemed unusually warm  though the sun had disappeared  behind dark clouds      what  you were pushed in   stammered will  and he gathered up his camera  in his arms  casting a look of alarm around  as if afraid lest some  hideous form dart into view  bent on snatching it away      that s the truth  i was just sitting here when i heard a step  thought  it was you  and asked how you had got on  then the beggar laughed  gave  me a shove  and over i went   ker chunk   i let out a yell when i came  up  for you see i didn t exactly know what he might mean to do    explained the dripping one      and i don t blame you a bit  but didn t you see him at all       never had a peep  he dodged back so that when i got the water out of my  eyes he was gone  i saw those bushes over there moving  and knew he ran  off that way      will walked over to the bushes  looking cautiously about  but  seeing no one      sure you didn t  er  go to sleep out on that log  and dream somebody  gave you a push   he queried  cautiously      rats  i guess i ought to know  but see here  perhaps you can prove it    declared bluff  indignantly      how   demanded the other      look down at your feet and see if he left any trail  that s how      will immediately did as he was told      say  come here  there are tracks all right  perhaps you re better up in  that sort of thing than i am  it was a human being after all  and no  dream   he called     bluff hastened to join him      why  of course  just as i said  this is where he hurried away  you can  see the mark of his feet easy  and looky there  one shoe  the right  has  got a patch on it  a piece that runs to a point  oh  i d know that skunk  any time from that  it s a sure clue  i tell you   he exclaimed      but you d better get dried off as soon as you can  why  you re  shivering now       got any matches  mine are all soaked   said bluff  his teeth  rattling together      i always carry a few  yes  here they are  let me make a quick fire   while you jump around to warm up  and bluff   please  keep your eye on my  camera  won t you       sure   replied the other  commencing to leap and frisk around  so as to  get his chilled blood in circulation again     the fire was speedily made  and  taking off his clothes  bluff hugged  close to the blaze while will busied himself in hanging up the wet  garments  though he had more or less difficulty in tearing his eyes away  from the spot where his camera lay close by      sometimes we get too much fire  then again we want more and more    remarked bluff  as he kept turning around like a roast on the spit  for  as fast as one side felt warm the other grew chilled      and i guess that we d better be beating it back to camp as soon as  your duds are decently dry  i don t like the looks of that sky    remarked will      i think you are right  there s certainly a big storm coming  why  the  air seems dead  just like it is in summer before a gale of wind  and camp  is nearly two miles away from this place  don t you think i could put  them on now  will       they feel pretty dry  do as you please   said the other  not willing to  commit himself  though anxious to be off  for the black looks of the  heavens began to appall him not a little      then here goes      suiting the action to the words bluff hurriedly dressed  then he secured  his nice string of fish  and  with his pole over his shoulder  announced  himself ready for the homeward tramp     they made all reasonable haste  and managed to reach the camp in due  time     when frank heard what had happened he was very angry      some more of the mean work of that crowd  i believe it must have been  andy himself who pushed you in  a dirty trick  how did he know whether  you could swim or not   he said  after the tale was told      oh  well  it wasn t a case of swimming  for the water wasn t five feet  deep  and all i had to do was to crawl out again  but it was wet  you  see  and a fellow feels mighty uncomfortable all soaked  just wait  i ll  get even with him some day for that trick  i ve got the rascal located  all right  one of his shoes had a patch on the sole i d know again       a clever idea   admitted the other  in admiration   and i hope you find  him out  no matter who he may be  first they stone our camp  after that  they try to burn us out  and now some busybody throws you into the lake   what next  i wonder       you forget the worst thing of all  the stealing of my gun    grumbled bluff      well  i wish jerry was back  i hate to think of him wandering around in  the woods in the storm that s coming  for it s going to be a corker    remarked frank  eying the darkening sky with uneasiness      perhaps the old trapper influenced him to stay over with him till  to morrow   suggested will  who was making his beloved camera secure  against rain by wrapping it in folds of waterproof material brought along  for the purpose      a bright idea  and i hope it s so  but you know  he said he meant to  take in a new locality for a hunt after seeing jesse  well  jerry is up  to many things connected with woods life  and at any rate he knows how to  look out for himself   and as he spoke frank stooped down by the tent      what are you doing now   asked the curious bluff      driving these tent pegs in deeper  there s no telling what sort of wind  may be on us  listen to that  will you   said frank      thunder  as sure as you live  pretty late in the year for that   ain t it       oh  we sometimes hear it even in winter  but  you see  the day has  been unusually close and muggy  i felt a storm in the air this  morning  and i m not surprised  but i would be glad to see jerry show  up   continued the other  as he tapped each pin a few times  to send  them in more securely     the muttering in the distance increased constantly in volume     frank  as an old campaigner  knew what was to be done  under his  directions toby and the two boys made everything as snug as could be  expected  they also concealed some dry wood in the hollow of a tree  nearby  so that later on they might be prepared for making a fire     the storm came at last  with a furious wind  and a heavy downpour of  rain      wow   exclaimed bluff  as he looked out from the tent   ain t i glad we  got here before that came  one ducking satisfies me  i m not greedy      the afternoon waned  and night came on  still there were no signs of  jerry  frank worried some  but stopped speaking of the matter  for he saw  that old toby was beginning to shake with fear  as the wind increased in  fury  and the tents wobbled about at a great rate      i hope they hold out   said frank to himself     he even donned a waterproof he had brought along  and going outside   tapped the pegs all around again  everything seemed secure so far as he  could see  still  he knew that if one peg gave  the balance could not  resist the additional strain  and a catastrophe must result     old toby was really too much alarmed to retire to his fly  so frank told  him he could remain with him when the other boys went to their tent     none of them expected to obtain much sleep  the wind came in fierce  gusts  the trees groaned and writhed  and once or twice frank really  heard a crash in the forest that told of a rent in the timber      i only hope nothing of that kind happens around here  a falling tree  might pin us all under  and be our death   he said to himself     at length they concluded that it was time to separate and try to get some  sleep  though both bluff and will declared they knew they would not close  their eyes so long as that howl kept up without  and the canvas fluttered  with each wild gust     just as they were about to make a run for it  frank caught them by the  arms      wait   he shouted  for there was a terrible crash close by  and the  earth seemed to tremble as a forest monarch was laid low     at the same minute with a shriek the wind descended upon the tent under  which they were crouching     frank heard a snap above the other sounds  and like a flash the entire  tent was blown away  leaving the four campers exposed to the fury of  the storm           chapter xiv    how jerry was treed      jerry  that same morning  reached the camp of the old trapper without  any trouble     he did not find jesse wilcox at home  but  knowing something of the  trapper s habits  he made himself comfortable  and waited     after a time the other showed up  he carried a tidy bunch of fur along  with him  having stopped to remove the pelts on the way      glad to see ye  jerry  looky here  one fine fox  and  would ye believe  it  actually a mink  boy  that ere pelt orter bring me a twenty  all  right  that s why i m so tickled  ye see  this shore must be one o  my  lucky days  make yerself to hum  come to take a snack o  dinner along  with me  i reckons  eh       well  i might wait up and have a bite if you don t keep me too long  you  see i mean to make a roundabout trip into that stretch of woods you told  us about i d like the worst kind to get a crack at a deer  that would be  worth while  jesse       then i ll get busy right away  but p raps ye d better defer that ere  trip fur a day or so  lad   remarked the trapper  sweeping an eye upward      why   asked the boy      thar s some sorter storm broodin   er i m bad deceived  in course at  this season we don t expect much along that line  but i hev seen a  scorcher come along  even in october  ten year ago it was  and thar was  quite some timber leveled  i m tellin  ye      but jerry was built along a stubborn line  having once made up his mind  to do a thing it was very hard for him to break away      oh  i don t bother about a little blow  if it comes to the worst i can  find a hollow tree  and keep pretty dry  now  i want to see just how you  cook that stew  so i can do it sometime      the dinner was a success  and  of course  jerry  being hungry  heartily  enjoyed it  when the meal was finished he arose  and picked up his gun      still of a mind to take that long tramp  air ye   asked the trapper      why  certainly  i haven t even thought of changing my mind    returned the boy      well  i s pose ye must  then  only keep yer eye peeled for trouble up  yonder  it s sure goin  to storm  for i feels it in my bones  besides   thar s a pack o  measly wild dogs loose in that stretch o  timber       wild dogs   repeated jerry  opening his eyes wider      sartin  dogs as has strayed away from ther homes  an  took back to a  wild state  it happens that ways sometimes  ther call o  the wild   they name it  sumpin  seems to pull the critters back  an  they break  away from human kind to roam the woods an  hunt ther livin   i seen  the pack once or twice  an  i kinder believe ther a gettin  more  fiercer all the while       wild dogs  eh  how many about are there  jesse   asked jerry  fingering  his shotgun a little nervously      from three to five ginerally  ye see they comes an  goes  so ther ain t  no tellin  jest how big the pack kin be  but ef so be they tackles ye   son  jest shin up a tree  an  then pick  em off  that s my ijee    remarked the trapper     shaking hands  after getting further directions  jerry hastened away     it was not long before he found himself in the densest kind of timber  in  fact  he had not seen anything like it since coming to the hemlock camp     here and there were little openings  in some of which green grass  grew  it was here the trapper had told him he might possibly find a  deer feeding  and as he made his way along  jerry kept on the lookout  for signs     he had been walking much over an hour when he thought he caught a glimpse  of a deer ahead  there was something moving there  at least  and with his  pulses quickened the boy began to slowly and cautiously advance     yes  it was a deer  and feeding  too     the light was none too good under the trees  with that dark threatening  sky over all  but jerry had keen eyes and he was just now excited at the  prospect of at least getting a shot     he kept on advancing  taking advantage of every bit of cover that  offered  to his delight the animal did not seem to pay any attention to  him  though raising its head several times to sniff the air suspiciously     by this time  he had gained a position where he believed he could make  the buckshot in his gun tell  and with as steady a hand as he could bring  to bear  jerry took aim at the exposed side of the deer     when he fired the animal fell in its tracks  and  giving a shout  the  exultant young hunter was about rushing forward to secure his quarry when  suddenly his horrified eyes discovered moving figures rushing through the  undergrowth  and heading toward the spot where the deer lay  still  struggling feebly     instantly he remembered what the trapper had said  these then were the  wild dogs  evidently they were hungry  and at the time he shot had been  trying to creep up on the animal which they yearned to make a meal from     jerry mechanically threw out the empty shell  and pushed another into the  chamber of his gun  he saw the pack bolt forward  heard the wild clamor  that marked their advance  and then caught the exultant strain in their  noisy yelpings  as they pounced upon the slain deer     the boy felt more indignant than alarmed  that was  his  deer  for he had  done the stalking up against the wind  nor was he at all disposed to  allow those greedy curs a chance to tear the quarry to pieces in their  savage way     jerry immediately hurried forward  ready to dispute the possession  of the game     he found the whole pack furiously tearing at the fallen deer  growling   and exhibiting all the savage nature of wolves     when the boy shouted they looked up  drew back their lips and looked  furious  but not one gave a sign of obeying him      get out  you brutes  leave that carcass alone  will you   he yelled   waving his gun threateningly     as if they realized that this human creature meant to dispute their right  to the royal dinner they had found  the four wild dogs started toward  him  they presented a terrible appearance just then  with the blood about  their muzzles  and white fangs exposed     perhaps jerry may have felt a shiver pass over him  but that did not  prevent him from raising his gun and deliberately covering the foremost  of the brutes     bang  went the gun  then arose a tremendous howling  together with  furious snapping sounds  the balance of the pack continued to rush  forward more rapidly than before  leaving the stricken member to roll on  the ground     jerry thought it high time he made an ascension  after the manner of that  which had marked the alarm of old toby at the time the wildcat invaded  the camp  but he wanted to use that other barrel the worst way     quickly covering the pack he pulled the trigger  then  without waiting to  ascertain what the results might be  he started to climb     this was no easy task  especially when encumbered with a gun  for he  would not think of letting this precious ally go  but there was enough  inspiration in the approaching yelps and growls of the wild dogs to spur  him on to heroic efforts  and  as a consequence  he managed to get beyond  their reach     it was an old tree in which he happened to have sought refuge  just then   however  jerry was not caring about that  for it was a case of any port  in a storm  and as he said   beggars should not be choosers      quite out of breath  he clung to the rotten limb and proceeded to shout  at the dogs so as to keep them there until he could find a chance to  insert fresh charges in his gun  when he expected to take care of them      hey  you with the collar  ain t you ashamed of yourself to take to such  a pirate life  when you once had a good home  i bet  say  ain t he a  jim dandy of a big bouncer  though  and as strong as an ox  i d just hate  to fall into his maw  now  hang around a few seconds more  and i ve got a  nice surprise for you  if you ever knew what a gun is  i guess you ve  forgotten by now      in this strain he talked to them  and kept both dogs jumping up at him in  the endeavor to get a grip  sometimes they brushed his dangling foot  with their jaws  and at that jerry involuntarily drew up a little     when he had inserted the shells  he tried to get a chance to cover the  big dog  that animal  though  apparently suspected his purpose  and kept  jumping about so wildly that it seemed impossible to aim at him  the  second brute had been wounded so seriously that it had crawled away  so  there were now but two left     finally  seeing a good chance to knock over the smaller one of the pair   jerry could not resist the temptation     the animal may once have been a family pet  but a wild existence of some  months  perhaps years  had taken him back to the wild state from which  his ancestors had come ages ago  he was a mangy looking  dirty white  brute  with eyes that seemed red to the boy in the tree     at the report of the gun the animal fell over in a kicking heap  for the  distance was so very short that the charge of shot had gone with all the  destructive power of a  forty four  bullet     but something not down on the programme immediately followed  the rotten  limb upon which jerry was hanging  unable to stand the strain of his  weight and movements  gave way with a crash     he felt a thrill of horror as he found himself being precipitated  downward  knowing as he did that the largest and fiercest of the wild  pack was still there  unhurt save in the way of a few stray shot that had  flecked his tawny hide with tiny blood spots           chapter xv    in a bear s hollow      jerry landed with a crash that almost shook the breath from his body     realizing the need of haste in getting upon his feet  he scrambled erect   he had maintained that frenzied clutch upon his gun  as if believing that  it was his best and only friend in this emergency     one thing helped him  the big yellow hound had been startled  first by  the crash of the gun so close to his head  and then again by the rapid  downward plunge of the human figure     perhaps some dim recollection of former beatings at the hands of some  severe master may also have temporarily demoralized the brute     at any rate jerry was given just about five seconds to turn the corner   and thus place the tree between himself and his enemy     then the dog bounded forward  and a warm chase began around that same  tree  with jerry doing his prettiest to keep beyond reach of those  gleaming fangs that pressed closely in his rear     in this he managed fairly well  but after he had pranced around that tree  quite a dozen times he made the alarming discovery that he was rapidly  being winded  his canine adversary  on the other hand  appeared to be as  fresh as ever     unless something occurred to assist him  it began to look very much as  though he might trip after growing dizzy  and the big yellow brute  pounce upon him     then a sudden thought came into his mind  it was like an inspiration   and made jerry laugh right out  why  of course his gun  what was he  gripping it all this time so desperately for if not because he believed  it worth while     he tried to remember whether he had fired one shot or two after reloading  it  so confused had he become with all this turning round and round that  he could not be absolutely sure  but there was nothing for him to do but  take chances     he felt to see if one of the hammers might be up  and found the left one  drawn back  that seemed promising  for if he had fired both barrels the  hammers must naturally be down     it might be only imagination  but he believed he could actually feel the  hot breath of the pursuing beast on his legs as he twisted around that  tree so awkwardly  with a prayer in his heart  though his lips were  mute  he suddenly whirled  thrust out the gun  and pulled the trigger     fortune was certainly with him that day  the dog viciously seized hold of  the gun barrel in his teeth  and it was just at this instant that jerry  pressed the trigger     he saw the big beast swirl half way around  then he fell in a  quivering heap      hurrah      it was but a pitiful shout poor jerry gave  for he was quite out of  breath  he  too  fell down in a heap close to the yellow form of his  enemy  but instinctively his hands worked  trying to place his faithful  gun in readiness for further work     it was not needed     besides the big yellow leader of the wild pack  he presently found a  second brute stone dead  and had the pleasure of dispatching both the  others shortly after      might as well make a clean sweep of it   he said  with a feeling of  having accomplished something worth while  for jesse had told him these  roving dogs were just as destructive to sheep and other domestic animals  as so many timber wolves would have been     perhaps the farmers of the community might feel like voting jerry thanks  for his good service of that day  and not knowing whether he could find  the place again he proceeded to cut off the four caudal appendages   to  embellish his tale   as frank later on declared with a laugh      guess i ve had quite enough sport for to day   jerry remarked  as he  bent over the mutilated deer   there s quite as much meat here as i can  carry home  in fact  i ve a good mind to hang most of it up out of reach  of wild animals  we could come for it another time  from the looks of the  sky that storm jesse spoke about must be coming right along      so he determined to make haste  while something of a novice at the art of  cutting up a deer  he had a general inkling as to how it should be done   accordingly  after half an hour s work he managed to swing the better  part of the meat  fastened up in the skin  to a limb that he made sure  was sound      now for home with my trophies  say  perhaps the boys won t open their  eyes when i show these four tails  and get toby to cook some of  my   venison  this has been a red letter day in my calendar  what was  that  thunder  i do believe  perhaps       jerry did not even wait to finish his sentence  but started off on a  lope     but the gloom under the heavy timber increased  he found difficulty in  telling the points of the compass  and finally it became absolutely  impossible for him to make more than a half way decent guess as to the  quarter where the camp in all probability lay      i suppose i m just about lost   he at length reluctantly admitted     still  jerry was not one to be easily daunted  he had been in situations  before now that called for a show of manliness and courage  and rather  prided himself on being equal to any such occasion     the thunder was booming heavily  and the rain ready to descend  he  believed he could hear a distant roaring  it might be wind tearing  through the forest  or a heavy fall of rain  perhaps both  at any rate it  would mark the breaking of the storm      better be finding that hollow tree i spoke to jesse about   he  concluded     once again luck favored the lad  not thirty paces away he discovered what  seemed to be a big stump  about twelve feet or more in height  it had an  opening at the bottom  large enough for him to crawl through  indeed  to  his mind  it was there especially for the very use he intended to put it     running forward just as the rain began to rattle down all around him   jerry proceeded to crawl through the aperture  he found the interior  amply large enough to give him the needed shelter  what was better  the  opening happened to be on the leeward side  so that the driving rain  could not find entrance      this is what i call a bully fit  talk to me about your cyclone cellars   what could beat such a cozy den as this  i m as snug as a bug in a rug   four wild dogs and my first deer  all in one day  i guess that s my  top notch record  all right  let her storm all she wants  so long as the  lightning doesn t take a notion to strike this blessed old stump   he was  saying as he mentally shook hands with himself over the day s  achievements     after a long time  hours it seemed to jerry  during a temporary lull in  the howling of the gale  he ventured to peep forth     everything was pitch black around  save when the lightning zigzagged  through space  and lighted up all creation with its electric torch      looks like an all night stand for jerry  there comes that wind tearing  things loose again  wow  it was a big tree went down that time  hope none  of them take a notion to knock my poor old stump flat  or i d be squashed  into a pancake      like many other people  jerry had a habit of talking to himself under  stress of excitement perhaps he believed that in this way he bolstered up  his courage  just as some men whistle when they find themselves trembling  in the face of some uncanny peril     and there he crouched while the gale blew with renewed violence  and the  night wore slowly on  several times there came a lull  and he began to  hope the worst had passed  when once again the wind would swoop down  as  though loth to give up its riotous dominion over the stricken forest     never had such a storm been heard of in october  even the first gale   which had demolished the roof of the academy  and brought about this two  weeks  vacation for the boys  had not equaled this  coming from another  quarter as it did     jerry had one bad scare     he had blocked up the entrance as best he could with what stray bits of  wood he found around  suddenly he felt his barrier moving  and realized  that some wild animal was nosing around  trying to force an entrance  for shelter     it must  after all  be the lair of a bear which he had found  was this  most remarkable day in all his experience to be wound up with an  encounter that might dwarf the other into insignificance     jerry gave a shout  at the same time he seized upon his gun  and fired  one barrel squarely through the opening  he thought he heard a loud   woof   but after that there was no further molestation     but  nevertheless  he lay there wide awake  and on his guard  should mr   bear pluck up courage enough to return  he meant to be ready to give him  a warm reception     time passed  and he believed the storm was really diminishing in fury  it  was certainly time  for from the various crashes jerry believed  considerable timber must have gone to the ground     how thankful he should be to have escaped as well as he had  why  the  mere fact that he was lost did not cut any figure in the matter when so  many more terrible things might have happened to him     there was really no sense of him leaving his snug retreat until dawn  came  for he could not make his way in the storm wrecked timber with any  hope of success     again he poked his way out to take an observation  perhaps he was  wondering if his shot could have killed the bear  but no sign of such  met his strained eyesight when the next flash of lightning came     but while he was thus trying to pierce the gloom around him  he heard  a sound that thrilled him through and through  the sound of a human  voice calling      help  oh  help   it came wailing through the night           chapter xvi    heaping coals of fire on his head       what s that   exclaimed jerry  startled by the cry     it came again      help  oh  help  somebody      the boy was now convinced that he had not heard the hoot of an owl  and  that some one was certainly in need of succor     he remembered the crash of the trees that had gone down in the tempest   could it be possible that the unfortunate one had been caught under one  of these falling forest monarchs  and pinned to the ground     if so  no wonder that he cried at the top of his voice for assistance   unable to escape he must starve to death  or become the prey of wild  beasts unless help came     jerry immediately crawled out of his hole  he no longer remembered the  fact that a bear had recently been sniffing at the entrance to the hollow  tree  all he had in mind was that he might be of assistance to a fellow  human being in distress     it was pitch dark in the woods  though now and then a flash of distant  lightning came to momentarily relieve the gloom     jerry started in the direction he believed the sounds came from  now and  then he paused to listen  and in this way managed to keep going straight      hello  where are you   he cried  finally  as a dreadful silence fell  upon the forest ahead  a silence that made him very anxious indeed     immediately a voice called out wildly      oh  here i am  under this fallen tree  please come and help me  i can t  hardly move  and i think my arm is broken  don t leave me to die       it s all right  don t worry  for i m not going to run away  speak again  so i can get to you  it s awful dark under here      the other took him at his word  and commenced to rattle on  saying all  manner of things  simply to direct his rescuer to the spot      it s andy lasher  as sure as i live   said jerry to himself  as he  recognized the other s voice  despite the agony in it     so making his way forward he finally came to the tree under which the  other was pinioned by some of the branches      i can t see you  it s so dark here  wait   he said aloud      oh  please don t leave me now  i ll go out of my mind  sure       i don t mean to  but i must have some light  now  i happen to have the  stub of a candle in my pocket  and the wind has died out  so i think it  will burn if i stick it down low  i ll get you out somehow  andy   said  jerry  cheerily     he struck a match      why  is it you  jerry       sure thing  see there  that burns all right  i guess  now  i ll put it  here in the shelter of this stump  while i look into things       you won t leave me here  jerry  you ain t that kind of a feller  i  know      andy was evidently alarmed  he could not but remember that there had been  bad blood between this lad and himself for a long time  indeed  some  recent events that were not at all to his credit  must have cropped up to  make him anxious      not much  say  you just had the escape of your life  i tell you  this  heavy limb almost hit you in falling  if it had  then it would have been  one  two three for you  you seem to be held down mostly by small  branches   observed jerry  after he had made a critical examination      do you think you can get me out  jerry   asked the other  very humbly      easy  just you wait  and when i tell you what to do  go ahead      with that he started operations  by breaking off the smaller branches one  at a time  he gradually weakened the network that was binding the  prisoner  every obstacle  however small  that was removed  made things  easier  and finally jerry gave a pull at the imprisoned boy     andy let out a howl of pain  but all the same he came free      my arm       i m going to look at that now  right away  if it is broken the sooner  you get back to centerville and see a doctor the better  but  somehow   i ve got a notion it s only badly bruised  here  bend it back  so i can  slip it out of the sleeve      with much misgiving and many exclamations of agony  andy did as he was  told  the other then examined it from one end to the other      talk to me about luck  you ve got cause to be mighty thankful  andy   there are a lot of bruises here  but no bones broken   declared jerry      sure you ain t mistaken  jerry   cause it s awful sore   groaned the  other  and yet there was a trace of gratitude in his voice      make up your mind it s so  now  the question is what are we going to do  the rest of the night  i was in a hollow tree  but there isn t room for  two  might manage to make a fire somehow  and stand it out  think you can  walk now  andy      jerry unconsciously thrust a supporting arm around the waist of the  other  and steadied his steps as they moved slowly off  in so doing he  was heaping coals of fire upon the head of his adversary  andy grunted  now and then as some jolt gave him new pain  but on the whole he was very  quiet  perhaps his mind was busy and his conscience working overtime     so they reached the hollow stump      here s where i was camped all through the storm  and mighty lucky for  you that i lost my way when out hunting  now wait till i dig out some of  that dry wood from the inside  it will make a capital start for a fire      jerry set to work with a vim  in five minutes he had a cheery little  blaze going  and more wood drying out close beside it  from time to time  other fuel was added to the fire until it reached such proportions that  it eagerly devoured any sort of stuff they chose to feed it      this ain t half bad  because it s getting mighty cold after that storm   and if you happened to be lying drenched through under that tree i  reckon you d be shivering some by now  eh   laughed jerry     andy put out his right hand  for it was the left arm that had been  injured      i want to tell you that i feel pretty punk now over the way i ve  treated your crowd  jerry  this is mighty white in you  and that s what   to act as you have with me  i m right sorry now i ever laid out to hurt  you fellers  i ain t goin  to keep it up no longer  and that s dead  certain  if pet peters wants to  he can go it alone  i m all in  you ve  made me ashamed      jerry understood  there was really no need of further words  between two  boys such things are instinctively grasped  and jerry knew what a  tremendous effort it must have been for this rough fellow to frankly  admit that he had been led to see the error of his ways     perhaps the repentance was not wholly genuine  and time would swing andy  back to his old ways  but just then  sitting by that friendly fire  he  seemed to feel very warmly disposed toward the lad whose coming may have  saved his life      oh  that s all right  don t mention it  glad to know you mean to let us  alone  it s all we ask  anyway  but what brought you away up here  andy    said jerry     andy dropped his head and gazed into the fire  the other even thought he  could see what looked like a blush mantle his cheeks  though the chums of  the town bully would have shouted at the very idea of such a thing      i reckon it was some more rotten business  jerry  to tell the truth i  was up to see old bud rabig  trying to get him to join us in a raid on  your camp  you see   the boy went on hurriedly  as though fearful lest  his courage might fail him before he got the whole thing off his mind    we d tried to smoke you out and made a botch of the trick  and i even  pushed bluff over into the lake this afternoon  to get him a duckin     cause the temptation was too great but it s all up with me now  after  this i ain t goin  to lift a hand against any of your crowd       did you get lost  too  trying to make your way back to your camp    asked jerry      that s just what i did  thought i could save time by taking a short cut  through the big woods  then the storm came down on me  and i reckon i got  some rattled  i lost my head  and while i thrashed around  that pesky old  tree came down on me  thought i was a goner  i give you my word   and  andy shuddered      how long did you lie there   questioned the other      hours and hours  it seemed to me  i d shout when i could  but something  seemed to tell me it wasn t no good  that i just deserved to die right  there  because i d never been no good to my folks at home or anybody  else  but you just wait and see  i got a light  i did  thought i was sure  goin  to die      both boys were soon sleepy  for the heat of the fire affected their eyes   so jerry fixed things to keep the blaze going while they napped  rolling  a log over so that it offered a good chance for the fire to feed     in this way they passed the balance of the night  nor would either of  them soon forget the experience  though from different reasons     in the morning they managed to cook some of the fresh venison jerry  carried  and for which the other seemed very grateful  then they figured  out their position  which was not hard to do  since the sky was clear and  the sun well up     half an hour later andy recognized certain landmarks that told him he  could make a turn and reach his camp by the lake shore      good by  jerry  i m going to skip out here  and i ain t forgettin   this either   he said  thrusting out a hand  while a queer grin crept  over his face     jerry hurried on  anxious to relieve the suspense of his chums     as he came in sight of the camp he paused and stared  as well he might   for it seemed to be occupied by a stranger  and he a man with the wild  aspect of a madman           chapter xvii    after the storm       whoop  all hands on deck to pump ship       my camera  oh  where did i put it       grab up the bedding and hustle in under the other tent  boys      this last from steady  clear headed frank  who seemed to know just what  should be done in an emergency     it started bluff and uncle toby working strenuously to keep blankets from  getting very wet  but will could not think of lending a hand until he had  first of all lugged his beloved camera under shelter     it was indeed fortunate that both tents had not gone by the board at the  same time  or the camp must have been plunged into the deepest distress   led by frank  they managed to hustle their belongings under the second  cover  where the driving rain could not reach them     by the time all had been done the boys were dripping  and it took them  some twenty minutes to get warm again  snuggled in their blankets      oh  what a night   wailed will a dozen times      please let up on that  or give us a change in tune  it s bad enough  to have to stand the storm without listening to a phonograph    grunted bluff     the hours crept along  now and then they dozed  but sound slumber did  not come to a single one of the group  uncle toby was quite content to  cower as close to frank as possible  satisfied that the other was able  to protect him  he seemed to exhibit the blind confidence of a dog in  an emergency calling for energy  to him frank was a type of manliness  hard to match      will the morning ever come   groaned will  as he shifted his cramped  position for the tenth time at least      well  i think we ve got a lot to be thankful for   declared frank   stoutly   in the first place  no great damage is done  for i saw that our  tent was caught in the branches of a tree close by  and we can rescue it  in the morning  then nothing was spoiled that i know of  and the storm is  really over  though morning is some two hours off   striking a match and  looking at his nickel watch      can t we have a fire   asked will  who was shivering under his blanket      just thinking so myself  it s getting sharp  now that the wind  has shifted into the northwest  suppose we make a try   answered  frank  readily     it was just in anticipation of such an emergency that he had hidden some  of the dry wood away where the rain could not reach it  frank s previous  experience in woodcraft had taught him many valuable things     securing some of this  he quickly had a little blaze  the others fed this  in a cautious manner  so as not to smother it by too much fuel  as a  result the fire was in a short time burning freely  and diffusing a  genial warmth around that proved very acceptable to the chilled campers     even will thawed out under its influence and ceased to grumble      it s all right  too  fellows  not a drop got in tinder these  waterproofs   he declared  as he eagerly examined his precious  possession     so the morning found them     the first thing they did was to rescue the runaway canvas  it was found  to be intact  the pins only having given under the strain  so shortly  afterwards the second tent again arose  and things began to look  shipshape around the camp      seems like an irish wash day   remarked will  as he surveyed the  various blankets and other things spread out on bushes to dry in the  sunshine and air      only for jerry s strange absence  i d feel bully   remarked frank      don t you think we d better start out and look for him   asked will      yes  after we ve had some breakfast  i never like to attempt anything on  an empty stomach  and  besides  you see  we may have to go all the way  over to jesse s shack before we learn about him   observed frank      do you really think he s stayed there   questioned bluff  anxiously  for  even though he and jerry seemed to be constantly bickering  deep down in  their hearts they had a genuine affection for each other  as had been  proven more than once      i hope so   was all the other would say      and i ve got a dreadful fear   remarked will  sighing   that the poor  fellow s been caught under a falling tree  so many went down last night   i ll hear that terrible crashing every time i wake up for a long time to  come  it haunts me  just because i imagined jerry out in it all      toby here banged the big spoon on the empty frying pan  that was a  welcome sound to a set of ravenous boys  and they quickly assembled  around the rude table upon which the black  chef  was placing heaps of  flapjacks  flanked by steaming cups of fragrant coffee     uncle toby did not seem to relish being left alone in the camp again  but  there was nothing else to be done  frank gave him some advice as to what  he should do if any wild beast invaded the place  and also how he could  threaten any of andy s crowd should they show up with hostile intent     then the three boys started off  meaning to head in a direct line for the  distant camp of the old trapper      what if we don t find him there   asked the skeptical will      wait till we get to the river before trying to cross  i reckon we ll be  apt to find some traces of him there  and even if he was caught out in  the woods in that storm  that s no sign he was hurt or killed  jerry  knows enough to get in out of the wet  and depend on it he found shelter  somehow  somewhere      so frank buoyed their spirits up in his accustomed cheery way  one could  easily see that he belonged to the optimist family  and never looked on  the gloomy side of things     they had not gone half a mile away from the camp before they discovered  some one moving through the bushes ahead      there he is   exclaimed bluff  eagerly  as he raised his hand to his  mouth  as if about to give a  cooie       hold on  i don t believe it is  there  you see  it s a man  and a  hunter  too  i expect  for he s carrying a gun   interrupted frank      perhaps he may have seen jerry  shall we ask him   demanded will      if we keep on straight we re going to meet him  and  of course  we ll  ask  i only hope he has  though i doubt it  do either of you know him      frank asked this because he was comparatively a newcomer in centerville   while the other boys had been raised there      seems to me i ve seen him before   exclaimed bluff   why  yes  it s mr   smithson  he lives in centerville  that is  his family does  because he  isn t home much  you see he s one of the wardens over at the state insane  asylum at merrick       what   cried frank  startled   then perhaps he may not be hunting wild  animals after all  suppose one of the mad inmates of that institution  escaped  and is up here roaming through the woods       jewhittaker   exclaimed will  turning a trifle pale  and hugging  his camera closer to his breast  as though his first fear concerned  its safety      if that s so  i hope jerry didn t run across him  that s all    remarked bluff      come on  hurry  you ve given me a little shock now  and we must learn  the truth immediately  call out to him  bluff  there  he sees us  and is  coming this way      as frank said  the keeper was hurrying toward them now  an anxious look  on his face  he nodded to bluff as he came up      camping up here  are you  boys  that s fine  used to like to do it  myself when i was younger  say  you didn t happen to see anything of a  wild looking chap anywhere around  did you   he asked  glancing at  each in turn      sorry to say we haven t  mr  smithson  has one of your charges  got away       that s just what has happened  and i ve been chasing him all over the  country  got track of him yesterday just before the beastly old storm hit  me  he s somewhere around this section right now  where s your camp   boys  he ll be pretty sharp set with hunger by now  and can scent grub a  long ways off   continued the keeper     the three lads looked at each other      what shall we do  fellows  doesn t seem just right to be chasing off  this way in a bunch  and leaving that poor old innocent alone in camp   what if this crazy man drops in on toby while we re gone  had we better  turn back  and later on  if jerry doesn t show up  organize another  expedition  dividing our forces      frank always put things so clearly that he seldom met with any  opposition      that strikes me as sensible   observed will  quickly      turn back it is  then  will you go with us  mr  smithson  we can give  you a good cup of hot coffee  and some breakfast  if you re hungry    said bluff      i accept your offer  boys  and glad to meet you  now  lead the way   please  because somehow  i seem to feel it in my bones that bismarck will  gravitate toward some place where there is an odor of cookery in the air   he always was a good feeder       bismarck   ejaculated frank      why  you see  that s what he thinks  and he carries out the part to a  dot  wait till you run up against him  if luck turns that way   replied  the other      he may have been injured in the storm   suggested will      not he  such a cunning fellow would know how to escape a wet back       is he considered dangerous   bluff inquired  a little anxiously      well  not particularly  although he can look mighty fierce  and would  terrify a timid person  possibly       and i guess uncle toby fills that bill  all right   said bluff   but  there s our camp through the trees  mr  smithson  and  as sure as you  live  there s a stranger standing poking at the fire where our cook is  bending down       bismarck is making himself at home  all right   laughed the warden           chapter xviii    a strange visitor in camp       what can we do about it   asked will  looking alarmed      it s up to mr  smithson   remarked frank  in a low tone      look here  boys  you understand that i want to capture the gentleman  very much indeed  are you willing to give me a little assistance   asked  the warden      why  to be sure we will  it looks as though we might have some interest  in his capture  too  judging by the way old toby is loading up our good  grub in those frying pans to suit his appetite  he threatens to eat us  out of house and home unless something desperate is done  we ll help  capture the escaped lunatic  eh  fellows       sure we will  frank  let mr  smithson tell us what to do  that s all    said bluff  readily      well  i hardly think he ll take the alarm at sight of any strangers  so  long as he doesn t get a glimpse of me  now  if you three just saunter  easily into camp  and pretend to treat him in a friendly way  you ll find  he can be a fine gentleman  humor his failing as much as you can  boys       and what else  sir   asked frank  who was listening intently      meanwhile i ll be creeping closer all the while  after he has been  fed he may feel sleepy  because he must have been up all night  the  heat of the fire and a good feed will make his eyes heavy   continued  mr  smithson      i guess you re right  sir       very good  suppose you propose that he lie down by the fire and take a  nap  rig him up a sort of military bed  he imagines that bismarck is  with the old emperor  off in france on the war campaign  when he s fast  asleep i ll creep into camp and get him secure  it will be easy  boys   believe me       say  is he the only one loose   asked will  just then  his voice  showing alarm      why  yes  so far as i know  why do you ask   demanded the warden      because there s some one else crawling through the bushes over yonder       are you sure   asked mr  smithson      i saw his head pop up  he s looking in at our camp  get your gun  ready  frank  some of these crazy people are said to be dangerous    continued will      humbug  if you saw any one at all it must have been a scout from andy  lasher s camp  snooping around   commented bluff  disdainfully      well  perhaps it might be another keeper from the asylum    remarked smithson      there it is again  what did i tell you  fel       will stopped speaking in a whisper and gaped  true enough a human head  had bobbed up above the tops of the bushes  as the owner of the same  endeavored to get a better view of the camp      it s jerry   ejaculated bluff  in excitement     mr  smithson dropped out of sight  thinking that the stranger in camp  might look that way  being attracted by the clamor of boyish tongues   jerry had caught the words of bluff and immediately turned his head      hello  fellows  howdye  and who under the sun is the new manager you ve  got to run the camp   he asked  pushing out to greet them each in turn   and eyeing mr  smithson in some curiosity      how are you  jerry  guess you know me all right  eh  why  i m up  here looking for an escaped lunatic  you see   said that worthy   without rising      talk to me about your coincidences  and that s him right there in our  camp  ordering poor old scared uncle toby around with the air of an  emperor  i see it all  boys   exclaimed jerry  shaking hands around as  though he had been gone for a full week instead of one night      well  he believes himself a bigger man than any emperor  for he makes  and unmakes kings  that is bismarck you see  young man  and we have just  been laying a plan to capture him  suppose you all saunter into camp  now  somebody tell jerry what we have decided to do  he s looking this  way  and ready to either run or hold his ground according to how the  wind blows       come on  jerry  you can tell us all that happened later  we must get rid  of this unwelcome visitor first   said frank      we had just started out to learn what had become of you when we met mr   smithson  and he advised us to return to our camp  as he rather expected  the gentleman he was looking for would drift that way  awful glad you got  through that terrible storm safe  old chap   remarked will      what are those things tied in a bunch at your belt  scalps   queried  bluff  as they walked along together      the tails of four wild dogs that tackled me in the big timber after i  had shot a deer which they wanted   remarked jerry  trying to speak  naturally      what   exclaimed the others in concert      oh  it s a positive fact  boys  i can take you to where the critters  lie  if you want to see them later  i was told about them ranging that  section  by jesse  who warned me to look out for them  i met the pack all  right  and i guess they wished i hadn t  here s some of the fresh  venison  i hung up most of it so we could get it later  then we made a  breakfast on part of what i was lugging home   jerry went on      we   remarked frank  inquiringly      of course  andy lasher and myself       andy lasher  where did you run across  him   and how did it come that  you let that miserable skunk eat breakfast with you   demanded bluff      well  he was in a bad way  you see  i just happened to get him out from  under the branches of a fallen tree that had him pinned tight to the  ground  his arm was bruised  and we bunked together until morning  andy s  got a repentant mood on him  he vows he s done playing nasty tricks on  our club   course i don t know how it will pan out  boys       say  did he tell you anything about my gun   asked bluff  eagerly     jerry turned and looked at the questioner      no  he didn t  suppose he confessed to everything he ever did  but here  we are  fellows  and our guest looks as if he didn t know whether to run  for it or hang by that breakfast toby is cooking      frank advanced toward the man  bowing  and assuming  as he believed   something of a military air      welcome to our camp  prince bismarck  won t you be seated  and wait for  breakfast to be served  we have only rude accommodations here  but i hope  you will pardon any lack of seeming hospitality   he said     the wild look vanished from the face of the gaunt man  and in its place  came an expression of tremendous importance  indeed  but for the  seriousness of the situation frank would have felt inclined to laugh  outright  it was so absurd to see this poor lunatic putting on such  magnificent airs      you forget  young sir  that i am the iron chancellor  and that while in  the field i shun all the comforts of home life  an iron cot  the simplest  food  these are enough for me  it leaves the brain clear to handle the  tremendous affairs of state that engross our attention  where is king  william   the other went on      oh  he ll be along after awhile  perhaps  prince  after you have  partaken of our simple fare and rested by our friendly fire a little  time  the king may join you      frank managed to keep a sober face while speaking in this lofty way  but  bluff and jerry  unable to stand it any longer  turned their backs on  the couple     evidently the lunatic was very hungry  in spite of his possession of an   iron will   he kept turning a wistful eye toward the fire where the  frightened black cook was hustling coffee and ham and eggs for his  benefit  and indeed  there was such an appetizing odor in the air that  several times mr  smithson raised his head and looked longingly over the  bushes as though he wished things would move faster  so he could come  into camp and get his share     when the food was placed before him the man ate ravenously  the boys  afterwards learned that he had not tasted a bite for two days  and they  wondered at his having shown even as much patience as he did     just as mr  smithson had said  the escaped lunatic became drowsy as soon  as he finished eating      let me fix a nice cot for you here  prince  when the king arrives you  shall be awakened  all right   said frank  soothingly     the man looked trustingly at him  so that frank felt a little qualm of  conscience over the fact that he had to deceive him      you are very kind  young sir  indeed  i believe i am weary  and  perhaps a nap would refresh me  if napoleon sends out a flag of truce  notify me at once   and he settled down on the warm blankets with a  sigh of pleasure      depend on it  such shall be done   replied frank  turning away  for he  had by this time reached the limit of his endurance  and if compelled to  keep this thing up much longer must have betrayed himself by laughter     in ten minutes he flew a handkerchief as a signal that the warden  could come in     mr  smithson grinned as he joined them      it was well done  my boy  you would sure make an actor  all right  and  now  for fear lest he slip me  i ll have to nab him   he said      do you want any help  sir   queried frank      oh  i reckon not  when he sees that i ve got him he ll be as meek as a  lamb  he looks on me as a jealous german general desirous of keeping him  out of touch with the king  watch now      he bent over the sleeper and touched his face      wake up  prince bismarck   he said  in a commanding tone     the other opened his eyes  stared and then smiled amiably  saying      oh  it s you  is it  general  fate is against me again  i yield myself a  prisoner of war  you can fasten my hands if you wish  but i have dined  well for one day            chapter xix    surprising trapper jesse      mr  smithson had carried his prisoner off  after he  too  had partaken of  the hospitality of kamp kill kare      boys   he said  in leaving   i m sure under obligations to you for all  this  and any time i can repay the debt don t hesitate to ask me  to get  bismarck back safe and sound after such a storm  is going to be a feather  in my cap  and only for you i d be hunting him yet  with only a slim  chance of success       why  that s all right  mr  smithson   frank had declared heartily    we ve enjoyed helping you  though it does make a fellow feel bad to see  as clever a man as that laboring under such a ridiculous fancy       he was once a professor in a college  and lost his mind through  overstudy   remarked the keeper  as he moved off  with  bismarck   at his side      there  see that   exclaimed bluff  triumphantly   just what i ve told  my dad many a time when he complained that i was falling behind my class   i ll make certain to hold this up as an awful warning       talk to me about you losing your brain by overstudy  there s about as  much chance of that as my being made king of england   laughed jerry      but still it  has  happened  you see  that establishes a precedent all  right  and my father  as a lawyer  is always talking about such things    declared bluff  not in the least abashed      now suppose you sit right down here  jerry  and let us have the whole  yarn from alpha to omega  what you haven t been through since you left us  yesterday morning isn t worth mentioning  to judge from the hints you let  fall  a deer  four wild dogs  lost in the big timber  storm bound   rescuing our most bitter enemy  and now helping to land an escaped  lunatic  say  you ought to feel satisfied  old fellow   observed frank     jerry laughed aloud     all his recent troubles  as viewed from the pleasant seat by the  campfire  with his three chums around him  seemed to fade into  insignificance      well  i reckon i am  there was a bear  too   he said  nodding      what  a bear  you ran across a bear   ejaculated will  drawing in a big  breath and shaking this head as if he deplored the loss of an opportunity  to embellish his album of the camping out trip with more fetching views      well  perhaps you could hardly call it that  seeing that he came looking  for me  trying to push into the hollow tree where i had sought shelter  from the storm       that sounds mighty interesting  trying to get in  too  was he  and i  suppose you objected vigorously   suggested frank  falling down by the  fire and assuming a listening attitude      i knew i hadn t lost any bear  you see  and  besides  there wasn t room  for two in that old stump  so i asked him to please go away   said jerry   with a wink      of course he did just that   queried will      after i had shouted  and fired my gun through the hole  he was somewhat  surprised at such a rude reception  for i guess that stump was one of his  dens  and he thought he had the first claim on it       well  start in now with your getting over at the camp of jesse  and give  us all the thrills you want  you ve got proof about the deer and the  wild dogs  but perhaps we ll have to consider the story about the bear    laughed frank      and andy lasher s repentance  that is the most surprising of all    declared bluff  shaking his head as though he could not understand  it at all     they sat there spellbound while jerry skimmed over the entire account of  his adventures since quitting the camp  as the reader already knows what  befell him  it would be useless repeating the story  the three chums   however  listened and exchanged looks with one another as some  particularly thrilling incident came along  as though they could imagine  jerry facing that big yellow brute that chased him round and round the  tree until he was dizzy enough to drop ere he remembered that he had a  gun in his hand      i move we go out there right after lunch and get the balance of the  venison  we may not have another chance to lay in a stock of fresh meat  all the time we re up here   proposed will  finally      oh  i can see that you re doubting my story about the dogs  and  wondering where under the sun i ran across these four tails  all right   fellows  i ll do the best i can to take you to the place  perhaps if we  went to old jesse he could guide us there much better   declared the  mighty hunter  calmly      he talks as though he courts an investigation   remarked frank   and  in justice to his reputation  i think we ought to settle this matter  without delay  so i m in favor of going  for one  besides  i confess to  a curiosity to see the dead dogs  and  perhaps  if fate is kind  look  into the identical hollow tree in which jerry passed most of that  stormy night       it s a go  then   cried will  eagerly   for i want a few more pictures   if we could only rig up something to look like that yellow hound  and  have jerry galloping around that tree in front of him  it would be  simply immense       talk to me about a faker will you  why  if will keeps on he ll be  bamboozling the public worse than any showman ever did  thanks  but i  guess you ll have to excuse me from that galloping act  will  once bit   twice shy  you know  but it was gospel truth about andy  he even  confessed that he had been up to old rabig s place to get him to join the  crowd in playing some more measly tricks on us here  you see he was  sorry  and had to just tell all these things       all but about my gun  hang him   grumbled bluff  indignantly      bother your old gun  will we ever hear the last of it   exclaimed jerry   frowning  and yet giving frank a sly wink with one eye  as if to inform  him that he did not really mean all he said      you never heard the first of it yet  for i didn t even have a single  chance to shoot it off   complained the other      for which all the little birds and chipmunks are rejoicing  for they  have had a chance to live  besides  a gun like that is dangerous to the  community  i think  if it ever started to going i believe it would spit  out fire without any help from you  or any one else  but  for goodness   sake  change the subject  i m sleepy   declared jerry  curling up on a  blanket by the fire      all of us are  i reckon  you see we were having a little circus of our  own at the time this happened to you   remarked frank      yes   exclaimed bluff   don t you think you re the only pebble on the  beach  jerry       why  what happened   demanded the other  looking up      why  what do you think we ve got all those things on the bushes drying  out for  yes  one of the tents blew away in the middle of the storm  i  think it must have been an hour or two before midnight  when the big gust  came that tore it loose  we were all four of us under it  and there was  some tall scurrying just then  believe me       i can well believe it  frank  where was will with his camera then    asked jerry      trying to keep the blessed thing from getting soaked   answered bluff      then he doesn t believe in wet plates   laughed the other      seems not  films are good enough for him  well  we managed to get all  the things under the shelter of the other tent  and shivered for some  hours  finally  after the storm passed  and it began to get very cold  we  started a fire and waited to welcome the rosy dawn       don t get poetic  frank  i m really too dead for sleep to appreciate it  now  wake me up  fellows  when lunch is ready  will you   and  so  speaking  jerry curled up again  this time in earnest     the others amused themselves the balance of the morning in various ways   bluff declared that he believed he would stay in camp while the others  went off  frank looked at him curiously as if wondering what had struck  him  for he considered that the trip was well worth taking  if only to  see the husky looking wild dogs jerry had met and slain     he could remember having heard one or two persons speaking about the  pack that was giving the farmers so much trouble  to think that  after  all  their comrade had been the one to relieve the situation  was  pleasant indeed     they aroused jerry when uncle toby announced that lunch was ready  the  old man seemed to be kept pretty busy preparing meals for all stragglers  happening in  but that part of the business pleased him  the only thing  he protested against was being left alone in camp  there were too many  visitors at such times to suit him     first had come the wildcat  and then the wild man  uncle toby had  therefore heard bluff s announcement that he intended remaining behind  when the others went off  with particular pleasure and much relief     immediately afterwards the three lads started out  jerry seemed much  refreshed by his nap  and was as lively as either of his comrades     a straight line was kept for the shack of the old trapper  and when they  finally reached the place it was to find jesse just starting out      why  hello  boys  glad to see ye   he said  shaking hands all around   gravely   and i ll be hanged  if thar ain t jerry  big as life  i was  gettin  uneasy about ye  lad  an  just startin  to follow up your route  through the big timber  ye see  i kinder thought ye might a fallen foul  o  them fierce wild dogs i told ye about      both frank and will laughed      well  he did all right  just that same thing  and we re on our way now  to see where he left the critters   declared will      left  em  looky here  ye don t mean to tell me  it can t be possible now  he fit that hull pack  an  got out o  it alive   exclaimed the trapper     then jerry  with a laugh  dangled the four tails before his  startled eyes           chapter xx    proving his claim       jerusalem  i surely believes he s gone an  done it   exclaimed old  jesse wilcox     frank and will burst out into a laugh      do you recognize these tails then  trapper   asked the former   because  we even accused jerry of trying to palm off some substitute on us for the  originals       oh  them there is original tails all right  how did ye do it  youngster   an  if they ever was fierce dogs  that pack filled the bill  i d kinder  hated to be up agin  em myself  an  you on y a boy       a boy armed with a double barreled shotgun loaded with buck is able to  do just as much as a man  i suppose  i got my deer  too  jesse  thanks to  the directions you gave me  it was a bully old time all around   said  jerry  contentedly      well  i should smile to mention it  ye take the cake  jerry  an  now ye  want me to lead ye thar  i s pose  can ye describe the place well enough  for me to recognize it   asked the trapper      possibly i can  let s see  i remember that there was a queer looking oak  standing close by  three trees in one  as though sprouts had grown up  when the parent trunk was smashed by lightning long ago  remember having  seen anything like that in your trips through the big timber  jesse    asked the other  seriously     the trapper smiled      why  it s right easy  i know that place as well as i do my own dooryard   shot a stag down by them three oaks myself ten years ago come christmas   so that s whar ye met up with the dog pack  was it  all right  if so be  ye are ready  we kin start right off   he remarked eagerly     all of the others were equally anxious to proceed  jerry because he  wished to prove his hunting triumphs  and his chums to see the evidence  of his valor  will  no doubt  still hoped to induce the victor to attempt  some sort of running stunt in connection with the tree and the dead dogs   that would form the basis of a striking picture     going in a bee line  as led by the sagacious trapper  who knew the  woods like a book  the little company did not spend more than an hour  on the way      thar s yer three oaks  son  now tell us jest whar ye was when ye shot  that deer      as he spoke  jesse pointed ahead  all of them could easily see the  landmark now      it was an old tree  and there ought to be broken branches underneath   yes  if you look over yonder you ll see it  and isn t there something  that looks yellow from here   asked jerry  proudly      just what  the dog story was founded on solid facts  then   exclaimed  frank  hurrying forward  with the others at his heels      it was a true tale   chimed in will  from the rear     they found the dogs just as jerry had left them  the big yellow brute lay  under the rotten tree  with his head mangled from the discharge of the  gun at close quarters  the dingy white one farther off  and presently  jerry led them to where he had dispatched the others      and there s my package of vension  all right  hanging up yonder  i was  afraid some prowling lynx might get away with it   he remarked   composedly  while his two admiring chums were whacking him on the back  admiringly  and insisting on proudly shaking hands with him over and  over again      now  to make a clean sweep  come with me and i ll show you where i  pulled andy out from under the fallen tree   he said     frank laughed and would have protested  declaring that he stood ready to  believe anything jerry might say after this  but the other would not let  him hold back      i demand that you investigate  see  here s where my charge tore up the  ground when i fired through the rotten wood to scare the bear away  and  you can see the plain mark of claws on the old tree trunk  is it so   fellows   he asked      without the least doubt  no ananias here  that s sure   declared frank      all right  now walk this way only a short distance  i heard the yells   you see  above the racket of the storm  and that told me the one who  shouted must be near by  there s the fallen tree  think what a narrow  escape andy had from being crushed to death       and it s easy to see where you dragged him out  why  here are the prints  of his shoes in the mud as plain as type   remarked frank      where   asked will  showing sudden interest  and then after getting down  to look at short range he laughed  saying   everything is just as jerry  says  i know it was andy he pulled out from under this tree       how do you know   demanded the party in question  curiously      why  you see it was andy lasher who knocked bluff off that log into the  lake  we guessed it at the time  and he afterwards said as much to jerry  here  well  we found his footprints  and you see one of his shoes had a  queer patch on the sole  a sort of triangle  here it is  as big as life      he pointed triumphantly downward  frank fairly shouted  and even  jerry grinned      talk about your great detectives  why  they ain t in the same class as  our chum here  you see  fellows  truth will out  what more proof do you  want   demanded jerry      everything has been proven  you are the hero of the hunt  jerry  i pass  up my claim when you re around  and so andy means to let us alone  does  he  can he speak for his whole crowd  too   queried frank      i don t know  perhaps not he said something about pet peters having to  do it himself if he insisted on carrying on this nasty business of  bothering us  so perhaps we may have more trouble with them  unless andy  takes the bit in his teeth  and licks a few of his pals      will was meanwhile busily engaged with his camera  he first of all  dragged several of the dead dogs around until they presented a gruesome  appearance  bunched close together      oh  if you would only run around that old tree a few times  jerry  you  don t know how much obliged i d be  of course any one must imagine that  the dog pursuing you happens to just be out of sight at the time i snap  you off  but think how much pleasure the picture will give future  generations   please  do   he begged      what do i care about future generations  it would give me the nightmare  every time i looked at the measly thing  i guess you d feel the same way  if you just imagined you were going to have a piece gobbled from your leg  with every revolution you made  nixey for me  old chum   observed the  other  indignantly      then if you won t  i suppose i ll have to take a still picture  but it s  really too bad  however  i have others of you  and some day i ll try a  composite picture  inserting you in the honorable position you decline to  fill   grumbled will  as he pressed the button  and secured his view of  the venerable tree with the clump of dogs near its base      talk about your obstinate chaps  did you ever see the equal of him  when  i decline to do the tall running act  he s going to get out a fake  picture anyway  with me in it  in that case i might as well stand for it   here  you  i ll conspire with you to fix it  if it s got to be a  counterfeit  let s make it a decent one      so  after all  will s persistency won out      you ll be glad when you see the result  i m sure   he said  as he  assisted jerry to stand the dead hound on his stiffened feet  and  make it appear as though he might be stretching out in furious  pursuit of some one      now  let me get started winding up around the tree  tell me when the  humbug business is over with   growled jerry  beginning to circulate  over the same track he had covered on the preceding day at such a  speedy pace     this matter was soon adjusted to the complete satisfaction of will   though he seemed determined to get results  judging from the several   clicks  that announced his rapid fire work with the camera     the boys decided that there was no need of going back to the shack of  the muskrat trapper again  while they were just half the distance from  their own camp     jesse wilcox directed them  so that there was small chance of their  going astray  and  besides  jerry had been over the ground before on  this very morning      i wonder whether he ll bother taking the pelts of those four dogs    ventured will  as he and his two friends walked briskly along      hardly  dogskins may be valuable  but the buckshot in my gun just about  ruined those for any use  all but the yellow fellow  i had to laugh at  jesse when he saw these tails  his eyes were like saucers   declared  jerry  chuckling      all right  it was a pretty clever piece of work  and he knew it  if that  big hound had ever laid hold of you  ugh  i don t want to think of it   let s talk about something pleasant  bluff s pump gun for instance    remarked frank     his eyes met those of jerry  and the other turned red in the face      i don t see anything pleasant about that subject  goodness knows we hear  enough of it from him  what d ye suppose he wanted to stay in camp for    he demanded      perhaps to cudgel his brains in order to remember whether he could have  taken it with him when we ran out of camp that night  or  perhaps  to  give another look around   suggested frank  dryly      good luck to him  then   continued jerry   he ought to employ the great  american detective will here  who discovers things by the print of a  foot  possibly he could follow up the trail of the thief until it led to  the lost gatling gun       it would have been a good idea if taken at the time  what s this plain  trail lead to   asked frank      i think it leads direct from the hemlock camp to where andy s crowd  holds out   replied jerry  who knew considerable about this region      are we far away from the lake  then       it s some closer than our camp  this trail has been traveled more or  less lately  too  that proves those fellows have been back and forth   they re bound to spend pretty much all their time while up here trying to  make life miserable for us  we turn to the left here  fellows  and go  right along this way      the other two  after a look along the trail that led to the lake camp   were just starting to follow jerry when they heard a muffled cry  looking  hastily around  to their great astonishment no jerry was in sight  and in  the trail they discovered a gaping hole which was partly covered with a  layer of slender sticks  thickly strewn with dead leaves           chapter xxi    down the old shaft       he s gone   cried will  aghast      what sort of a trap has he dropped into   exclaimed frank     he was a lad of action  and throwing himself down flat he crawled to the  very edge of the gaping hole      hello  jerry   he shouted      i m all right  fellows  only bruised a little  and my feelings  considerably hurt  i deserve something for forgetting this hole   came a  voice from out of the depths     frank looked down  his eyes being accustomed to the sunlight he could not  see anything but darkness there  but even as he was trying to pierce  this  a match flamed up  and he discovered his chum kneeling on a pile of  dirt  holding up his improvised torch as though curious to look around      what is this place  jerry   demanded the one above      why  will must remember if he once gets his mind off that miserable old  camera of his  it s the shaft of what was intended to be a mine   replied  jerry  with disgust plainly marked in his tones      a mine  and here  i never heard of it   echoed frank      that s because you are a newcomer in centerville  years ago  oh  i  couldn t say how many  a crank lived in the little hut close by  now  occupied by the family of a lumberman  he believed there was gold in this  region  for nearly a year he dug down and made this shaft  then he died  in his cabin  and no one else ever had faith enough in the thing to  continue the work   said will  chiming in      what  do you mean to say this hole in the ground has gone all these  years as a trap  ready to swallow any pilgrim who walked along this  trail   demanded frank      why  of course not  the boys from town often used to come up here  will  has been down in this hole  and so have i before  it was covered with  heavy planks then  somebody has removed those boards and laid a fine  trap  just like we were over in africa  among the wild beast catchers   and i fell in  worse luck   grumbled the boy at the bottom of the shaft      i see  and you think those fellows in the other camp had a hand in it       don t doubt it at all  you know yourself it would be just like that pet  peters  if i d only thought of the blooming old thing in time  i might  have investigated  talk to me about your alpine climbers  i thought i was  going into the crevasse  all right       but how are you going to get out   asked frank  always practical      a fellow can t climb out  i know that  for we used to try it  somebody  always had to put down the long pole that we made into a ladder    declared will      is it around here now   continued frank      wait and i ll give a look      will very carefully placed his camera with its accompanying case of  films  he made sure that it was out of the way  so that no one might  incautiously step on the same  and ruin his heart s delight  then he  passed into the bushes to scour the immediate neighborhood     meanwhile frank bent over the edge again      i ve examined this covering up here  jerry  and there s not the least  doubt but that it was made with a distinct purpose   he declared      i reckon it was  and it got me  all right  it looked just like the rest  of the trail  and i never suspected a thing until i found myself going  down  speak to me about that  will you  to think that i was caught by  such a shabby trick  if it had been you  now  it wouldn t seem so bad   because you never saw this hole before       but what object could those rascals have had in constructing the trap    pursued frank  seeking more light      that s hard to say  i imagine  though  they expected to just badger us  from time to time until finally we all set out in full chase of the  crowd  then perhaps they meant to lead us along this old trail  avoiding  the pit themselves  and having us tumble in pell mell  it was a clever  dodge  but a mean trick all the same       but if that had happened it might have been serious  one of us could  easily break a leg or an arm in such a tumble   expostulated frank      huh  little those fellows care about that they re a rough lot  you know   that pet peters thinks everybody is made of iron  like himself  say  i  hope will finds that old ladder we used to play with  i d hate to lie in  here waiting for you to go all the way to camp and get a rope   grumbled  the imprisoned one      i hear voices  and i reckon will must have met some one  yes  there  they come       with the ladder   demanded jerry  eagerly      they seem to be carrying something between them  why  i ought to know  that fellow  as sure as you live  it s andy lasher   declared frank   somewhat surprised      then it s all right  i m satisfied   said jerry  resignedly     the others came forward  and as frank had said they bore between them a  long  slender tree upon which many slats had been nailed by the boys   this formed a rude but effective ladder  upon which one might ascend  and descend when desirous of seeing what the interior of the abandoned  shaft was like      i came across andy down the trail  only for him i guess i d never have  lit on the ladder  for they d carried it some distance off  and hid it    cried will     andy looked frank straight in the face  and the latter explained      it s mighty funny  but you see i remembered about this here trap the  boys had set  hopin  some of your crowd would take a tumble  i told  em i  wouldn t stand for it after what had happened  so a bunch o  us was on  the way out here to put back the planks  when we heard shouts  and  guessed somebody had fallen in  the rest dodged into the bushes  but i  commenced to run this way  then i met will  here       and we got the ladder  he was only too willing to help   went on will   plainly fully believing in the change of heart on the town bully s part      say  that s all mighty interesting  but talk to me about it after you  get a fellow out of this black hole  i thought i felt a snake right then   we used to kill  em in here  too  poke the ladder down  boys  please       that s a fact  as the drowning boy said   save me first and scold me  afterward   let me give you a hand  boys   remarked frank      hey  be careful there about getting too close to the edge  the whole  bunch of you will be in on top of me if you don t look out  i had a crack  on the head from a rock right then  and be careful how you poke that  ladder down  or you may stick it through me like a lady s hatpin  now  i ve got hold of the end  lower away  all      so under the directions of the boy who was in the hole  and in a position  to see how things lay  the single pole ladder was placed in position      i m coming up now  fellows  don t let the dirt crumble in on me    called jerry      it does beat all how the adventures crowd you  old man  here the rest of  us just go along in an average way  and nothing happens to anybody to  stir the blood  hang it  i say it s hardly fair   remarked frank  in  pretended chagrin     jerry began to appear in view  clinging to the ladder  for it was a  rather rickety affair  and threatening constantly to turn around  so that  he had to fasten both knees and hands to the pole as he mounted      keep her straight  andy  you understand how hard it is to hustle up this  old beam  i m getting there all right  and don t you forget it   he kept  saying  with a broad grin on his happy go lucky face as it came into  plain view      oh  jerry  please hang there for just twenty seconds  you don t know  what a splendid picture you make  i d give almost anything to snatch it  off  oblige me like a good fellow  won t you  please   shouted will   waving his hands entreatingly      talk to me about nerve  you beat all creation  i m holding on by the  skin of my teeth  and you want me to wait till you get your measly old  camera adjusted  and snap me off in this ignoble position  well  i m  waiting  but it s to get my second wind  and not to oblige a crank    gasped jerry      oh  thank you  jerry  thank you  it will only take a few seconds  i m  sure  and the result will be a constant source of delight to every  member of the club       yes  i ve no doubt they ll go into spasms of laughter every time they  look at the human ape hanging to his limb  hurry up  plague take it  i m  getting weary of posing to suit your convenience  why don t he  come back  and finish  i declare if i can stand this any longer  i tell you i m  coming up  will  picture or no picture       here he comes  just hang on a bit longer   said frank  soothingly     will came dashing up  showing the most intense excitement  his eyes  fairly bulged from his head  and he was quivering all over      what ails you  man  are you sick   demanded frank  in real alarm      sick  no  but i m broken hearted  that s what  it s gone   shouted the  other  wringing his hands   some wretch has stolen my camera  and films            chapter xxii     look pleasant  please         what s that   exclaimed andy lasher  jumping up from the side of frank   where he had dropped to lend jerry a helping hand      my camera s stolen  i placed it carefully behind that tree so nobody  could step on it  and now the whole thing s disappeared   said will   almost choking with deep emotion      i bet that s the work of pet peters and the other fellows   exclaimed  andy  his freckled face showing dark signs of anger      hey  don t forget about me   bellowed a voice from the depths   the  blooming old pole turned round then  and i slipped back five feet  hold  her steady  you fellows  and give me a chance to climb out       that s a fact  come along  jerry   said frank     so the imprisoned one crawled out  only too glad to once more plant his  feet on solid ground      talk to me about your trapeze acts  and your parachute drops  i guess i  know all the sensations  and let me tell you i don t hanker after any  more of the same kind  now  what s all this row about your black box   will   cried jerry  as he felt of his various joints to make sure he was  all sound      it s been hooked while we were getting you out  that pet peters has made  way with it  oh  if he ever tears open the package that contains my  beloved films  i m just ruined  all my work for nothing  and they can  never be replaced again       we ll get  em  don t you fear   exploded andy   i ll run back to camp  right away  and make him give  em up       if you only would  i d be ever so much obliged  andy  three dozen  yes   four now  of the finest scenes a fellow ever could take  why  some of  them are  immense        i suppose you are referring now to that one where that yellow dog was  chasing me around the tree  but i wouldn t die of grief if posterity  never got a squint at that picture   said jerry  shaking his head      please start now   urged will   for they will be opening the package  just for spite  one little bit of daylight and the whole thing will be  ruined  and from what i know of pet peters  i believe he d do it       i just reckon he would  now  all right  i m off   said andy      wait  and we ll go with you   declared frank  quietly      i can do it just as well alone  still  perhaps it is good to have you  fellers along  but we must run   andy observed      we can do it  come on  boys   cried frank    they started off through the timber  even jerry keeping up a rattling  pace  although somewhat out of breath      better not talk   admonished andy  when will manifested a disposition to  continue his doleful wails about his terrible loss      that s good advice  will  if you hope to recover your property  better  keep a padlock on your lips just now  besides  you need all your wind    remarked frank     they ran on     the trail was crooked  but kept drawing nearer the lake all the while      just a few minutes more   panted andy at length     and when less than that time had passed they could catch glimpses of the  cabin in which he and his crowd had taken up their quarters  after being  forestalled by the outdoor chums in the race for the hemlock camp     andy said nothing  but the manner in which he put his fingers on his lips  as he turned his head  was indicative of silence     he led them forward in such a way that the cabin stood between them and  the spot where several boys seemed to have clustered  interested in  something     when they looked around the corner of the hut they counted five in the  bunch  it was pet peters  a tall  raw boned lad  who was swinging the  camera to and fro in triumph  while he held up the waterproof package in  which will kept the rolls of films that had been exposed  awaiting the  time when he could develop the same      say  but won t them sissies be hoppin  mad w en they sees it gone   he  was saying  with a grin   an  we can keep it as long as we wanter       what s he got in the black bag  pet   demanded one of the others      don t know  but we ll soon find out   grunted the leader of the group   looking around for a place to lay the camera down while he applied  himself to the task of opening the tied up package      i bet it s films he s used  i know  because i got a bull s eye camera to  home   exclaimed another chap  pressing forward eagerly      who was it tumbled into the old mine shaft   asked pet  as he dug at  the knot with which the cord was fastened      don t know for sure  but i kinder think it must a been jerry wallington   i seen that frank and will along with andy   replied a third  quickly      glad of it  andy says as how he s under obligations to jerry  but fur me  i don t take any stock in that sorter thing  he jest couldn t let a  feller lie there and die under that tree  it sarves andy right because he  wanted to cover up the old shaft again afore any purty boy fell down in  it and skinned his nose  say  how d ye  spose they ever found that ladder  agin after we hid it        course andy got it for  em  he oughter left the kid in the hole  all night  hope he s bunged up good and hard by the tumble   came  from another      looky here  pet  ye know what ye re doin   i  spect   asked the one who  had but a minute before owned to having a camera at home      tryin  to open this pesky little package  all right   answered  the other      but if it has them films inside ye ll ruin the hull bunch if ye lets  daylight in on  em  undo the rolls that is wrapped each in black  paper  and the picters is gone just as quick as that   and he snapped  his fingers      what do i care  sarves them right for takin  our camp away  for two  cents i d throw the hull business into the lake  and let her swim    growled pet  who did not seem to be making much progress in his feat of  untying the binding cord     frank could feel will quiver with emotion as he pressed against him  the  very thought of his beloved camera and those invaluable films floating on  the water filled the boy with unutterable anguish  he even groaned   though the fact that the conspirators were so busily engaged  and talking  in the bargain  prevented them from hearing the suspicious sound      andy was a helpin   em   declared one of the group  as though that fact  might constitute a crime in his eyes       course  what more could ye expect arter the way he got us to go out  with him to cover up that hole again  andy s got religion  i reckon   leastways he ain t the same kind o  a feller he was   declared pet      but he turned on you mighty quick  i noticed  an  sed as how he d wipe  up the ground with your remains if you jest didn t go along and help undo  our work  he kin fight yet  even if he is changed   said the fellow who  hung discreetly on the outskirts of the group  and who was evidently a  devoted follower of the said andy      jest mind yer own business  tom somers  an  speak when yer spoken to   guess i know that yer intendin  to stick to andy through thick an   thin  but they ain t everybody feelin  that way  understand  if andy  he s a goin  to turn on us and be chummy with that crowd  we ain t  expectin  to stand it  see   declared pet  still struggling with the  obstreperous knot      them s my sentiments   observed another      me  too  fellers   declared a second      yes  it s easy for ye to talk that ways when he ain t around  but let  him give any one o  ye a single look an  it s eat dirt for the lot  ain t  i seen it done many a time  an  some day andy s goin  to give pet the  time o  his life   the single faithful henchman kept saying      oh  let up  tom  ain t any one o  ye got a knife  i can t never get this  here knot untied  hand it here  billy  now watch the fun  fellers   and  as he spoke pet opened a blade of the borrowed knife  and proceeded to  lay it across the cord     to judge by the way he sawed  that blade was too dull to cut butter      what d ye call this thing  anyhow  billy  one side s about as sharp as  t other  an  a feller couldn t commit suicide  if he tried to  with this  frog sticker       try mine   said the fellow who owned a camera      say  that s the cheese  it s got a edge all right  now wouldn t little  willie milton weep tears if he seen me a doin  this to his property   and  he bent down to sever the cord at one vicious blow     frank thought it high time to interfere     these unscrupulous boys would not hesitate to destroy all the results of  will s hard labor  and  in fact  take the keenest delight in wringing his  heart by so doing     there was only one way apparently to stop the desecration and save those  precious films from destruction  although opposed to violence on general  principles  still frank knew very well that there are times when it  becomes necessary for every one to stand up boldly for his rights     he gave a nudge to jerry which that worthy understood as a signal to be  ready  accordingly  jerry raised his shotgun until he had covered the  group in front of the cabin  and then waited for the word      step out and hold them   whispered frank  in his ear  and the four boys  made a sudden appearance from behind the shack      now  look pleasant  please  you fellows   exclaimed frank  as he made  sure that he had his gun held on a line to cover the leader of the rebels  in andy lasher s camp           chapter xxiii    more signs of trouble      pet peters looked thoroughly frightened when he saw that he had been  caught in the very act of opening another s property     the truth of the matter was  he had been warned of late by the town  authorities that on the very next occasion when caught taking things that  did not belong to him  they would send him to the reform school      don t you dare cut that string   said frank  sternly   or i won t answer  for the consequences  pet peters      the boy  with a scowl  threw the package down alongside the camera      there s yer old shebang  i ain t done it a speck o  harm  was just  kiddin   anyway  knowed will was around  an  jest wanted to make him  squeal   he declared     of course it was a barefaced falsehood  as every one understood  but it  seemed to be the natural thing for a fellow like pet to say  he always  squirmed out of a scrape that way  while andy had at least shown a  certain amount of boldness when caught      will  step up and claim your property  if it has suffered any damage i m  going to make him pay for it  if i have to take him all the way back to  centerville   continued frank     eagerly did the one addressed walk forward and pick up both camera and  package of films  he was within three feet of those five boys  yet never  a hand was outstretched to hinder him  they knew better  those grim guns  that bore upon them  and the angry faces of jerry  frank  yes  and andy   impressed them deeply      examine them  will  do you think either has been injured   asked frank       course they ain t  how could they be when i kerried  em carefully  them  scratches was on ther camera afore i touched it  i ll swar to that    exclaimed pet  really alarmed by this time     at which andy grinned as if highly amused      i guess everything s safe  frank  they stopped just in time  another  minute and the damage could not have been repaired   sang out the  delighted will  ready to almost dance with joy      which is a lucky thing for them  then  now  i don t know why we should  hang out here much longer  we ve got our own  and the air of this camp  isn t quite as nice as i d like  shall we go  fellows   asked frank      might as well   answered jerry   but before we do i think these chaps  ought to be told that the sheriff promised to drop in and see us  to morrow  and that if there s any more of this humbug and annoyance  tried  i m going to ask him to take the whole bunch back to centerville       and i promise to prefer a charge of malicious mischief against them  and  an attempt to destroy property  incendiarism is a crime  especially when  life is placed in peril  and one of us might have been burned while we  slept   added frank  severely     there were exclamations of alarm from the cowering boys  they had been  intimidated by the guns of jerry and his chum  but this new source of  danger chilled their ardor wonderfully      i reckon we ain t goin  to try any more tricks  fellers  thought we d  have a leetle fun out of this campin  business  but seein  as how ye take  it so hard  we d better draw off   muttered pet  completely humbled      yes   fun for the boys  but death to the frogs   as the old story says   that sort of thing is too one sided to suit me  just play your jokes on  each other  if you must amuse yourselves  we have our own way of  extracting fun out of an outing  well  come along  boys  and  andy  thank  you for helping get jerry out of that hole      he thrust out his hand to the other as he spoke  but andy did not take  it      ain t got anything to do with the rest of ye  but jerry he saved my  life  i told him i was goin  to quit naggin  his crowd  an  so i am  but  that don t mean i m a turnin  a saint right away  pet here is itchin  for  a lickin   an  i got a good notion to  commodate him      andy glared in the direction of his lieutenant  and it was plain to  be seen that the spirit of warfare had not as yet been diminished in  his bosom      oh  well  have it out among yourselves  boys  as long as you leave us  alone we won t bother you in the least  i give you my word   said frank      come on  you fellows   cried will   i m anxious to get away from here   that pet gave me the cold creeps when he came so near ruining my films   ugh  me for the comforts of our own camp      no one wanted to linger  even jerry was glad to turn his back on the old  cabin and stalk away  with his gun over his arm      say   called will  over his shoulder  a few minutes later  as they were  pushing through the woods and following the back trail      well  what is it   asked jerry      we forgot something  boys    continued the other      what s that   demanded frank  coming to a stand      why  when we were about it we ought to have demanded that they return  bluff s dandy  repeating shotgun   said will     thereupon frank broke out into a laugh and turned upon jerry      hear that  will you   he remarked  as if tickled      oh  rats  there s that blessed old gun bobbing up again  will i ever  hear the last of that machine   exclaimed jerry  shrugging his shoulders      not till the ghost is laid  i suppose  jerry   remarked frank     jerry walked along at his side  still grumbling as if he had a difficult  matter to solve and could hardly make up his mind     thus they came to the spot where the late catastrophe had taken place   the hole gaped at them in the trail      say  this is a dangerous thing to leave uncovered  some one else might  fall in  perhaps one of that lumberman s kids if they happened to be  playing hereabouts   remarked frank  as they paused to look down once  more into the dark depths      i wouldn t want my worst enemy to slip over that edge  my  but it was a  queer sensation i had when falling  let s cover the hole up again    remarked jerry      if we can find the planks it would be a good idea   echoed will     they started a search immediately  when andy and his followers had  removed this cover  to substitute the frail one of slender sticks   quilted with dead leaves and a scattering of soil to deceive the eye   they could not have taken the boards far away      i m dead sure they ain t in the hole   observed jerry  as they hunted      lucky for you they were not  as you might have broken a leg in striking  hard planks instead of soft soil   remarked frank      here they are  boys   sang out will just then     it took but a short time for them to carry the heavy planks back to the  place  and cover up the hole the crazy gold hunter had dug so many   years ago      hope those sillies won t think to steal them off again  they might trap  one of that lumberman s kids  and then the penitentiary for theirs  for  sure   said jerry  as he made sure the cover was secure on all sides      i rather think they ve had a lesson this time  and won t be in any hurry  to repeat the dose   laughed frank   come along boys      somehow jerry seemed to lag behind the others      what s the matter with him   asked will  turning his thumb backward over  his shoulder      perhaps conscience is at work  jerry has queer freaks  you know  wait  and see what develops   answered frank  mysteriously  and  although his  companion tried to get him to say more he absolutely declined     it was a short time after this that they heard the boom of a gun      hunters abroad  somewhere around  there goes a second  yes and a third   game must be plenty where they are   remarked will     frank did not reply  but the other saw that he was smiling as if his  thoughts might be pleasant just then      i just bet he s thinking of my sister violet   was what passed through  the mind of the boy  but for once he was wrong     they finally arrived at a point not a quarter of a mile from camp   frank turned to see if jerry was coming along  for he had not heard a  sound from him      how about that venison you insisted on carrying  i hope you didn t leave  it in that miserable pit  now  for i was calculating on having a feast  for supper   he asked  seeing that jerry still plodded along close by      i ve got it on my back all right  so don t worry  boys  and honest  now   come to think of it  i really believe the bundle saved me from a worse  shock than i got  i landed on it  if you please  don t know how it beat  me down  but it served as a fine old buffer  i look on that blessed deer  as my best friend       listen   exclaimed will just then     all of them could hear what seemed to be shouts ahead  they certainly  came from the direction of the home camp      now what do you suppose has happened there this time  can t we ever take  a little saunter through the woods without the camp being made the  theater for all sorts of strange dramas  wildcats  lunatics  and now  what   exclaimed jerry      i think it would be just as well for us to sprint along and find out   that toby seems fated to get into the queerest scrapes ever heard of   here goes   with which frank began to run     the others kept close at his heels  and as the outcries increased they  even put on additional speed  bursting out of the timber to see as  strange a spectacle as ever greeted the eyes of woodsmen returning to  their camp           chapter xxiv    what bluff did       why  it s a bear   exclaimed jerry  as the three boys came to a  standstill on the border of the camp      it sure is  and nothing less   admitted frank  his face beginning to  pucker up with the advance stages of a laugh      oh  if i can only get my camera on him  what glorious luck   breathed  will  as his trembling fingers worked to drag the little black box out of  its cover     the bear was busy just then  in fact  exceedingly engaged  he had taken  to turning things over around the fire just as though some one had given  him a sheriff s search warrant  and he meant to use it to the limit      he s hungry  all right  look at him getting away with the corn uncle  toby was just going to cook for supper  say  that must be the same old  critter i interviewed while i was caged in that tree   said jerry   tickled at the thought      what makes you think so   demanded frank      he s so curious and so persistent  you see  besides  i don t believe  there s another bear within ten miles of here  oh  it s my old  friend  you just bet  and that means i ought to have the privilege of  slaying him       don t be piggish  jerry  let some of the rest of us do something or  other   remarked frank  with a touch of satire in his voice     he had his own gun handy  and meant to have a share in getting a supply  of bear meat for the camp larder      do you see uncle toby  i ll be blessed if he hasn t gone and made a  ladder  and has used it to climb up in that tree yonder   declared jerry   snickering      sensible old toby  if i had to make shift to be a monkey as often as he  has  i think i d have a ladder  too  saves considerable trouble  you see   and the wear and tear on his clothes counts  too  but didn t we leave  bluff in camp  i don t see anything of our pard  do you  boys      a sharp  click  close to frank s ear announced that will was at his old  tricks again  he had snapped off a view of the shaggy visitor squatted  there with the open kettle between his paws  scooping up its juicy  contents with evident relish  canned corn was a treat that did not come  his way every day  and bruin meant to make the most of his opportunity      i thought i had a glimpse of something moving over there back of the  tent  and it might be bluff  i hope he don t try to shoo the old varmint  off before we get a whack at him  i ve only got bird shot in my gun but  at close quarters that ought to do as well as a bullet  eh  frank   asked  jerry  excited at the prospect      wait i ve a notion that you may be surprised yet  i ve also a hunch  my  boy  that there will be another claimant for the honors of this  campaign  sometimes surprises spring out of the very earth  watch   said  frank  laying a hand on the gun of his chum  as though impelling him to  hold his fire     suddenly there was a loud bang     the bear rolled over in a heap regardless of the congregated tinware that  was consequently sent scurrying to the right and to the left      who fired   shouted the amazed jerry      look out  fellows  the old rascal s up again  and i guess i d better get  behind a tree with my camera   exclaimed will  suiting the action to the  words with commendable rapidity     bang  went a second discharge at this juncture  and the bear now turning  bit savagely at its hindquarters as though its wounds smarted severely     immediately a third discharge followed the others  bruin had by this  time apparently sighted the party from whom all these stinging cuts must  have proceeded  he gave a roar of rage and lumbering awkwardly across  the space started to try and climb a little tree just alongside one of  the tents      it s bluff  and he s up in that tree   shouted will  as he peeped around  his own shelter  and took in the picture with another  click       but  he s got a gun   stammered jerry      of course he has  didn t he bring one with him  perhaps a good fairy may  have given him a tip as to where it could be found  there  he has fired  again  and that time he missed  for the range was too close      frank  as he was speaking  commenced to advance into the open      looky out  marse frank  he chaw yuh up  clean suah   bawled uncle  toby  from the crotch in the tree where his ladder had allowed him to  reach   git up heah  honey  whah he can t reach yuh  dat b ar am ma ad  clar t rough       four times he s shot  didn t i say he couldn t hit the side of a barn   think of him carrying a gatling gun   said jerry      but he  has  hit him more than once  look how the brute is bleeding  and  just to think  jerry  he s got two more chances  those pump guns don t  seem so very bad in an emergency   laughed frank  who seemed to be  enjoying the little affair very much indeed      there goes one more  and the bear still lives  talk to me about that   will you  if he didn t shoot its stub of a tail off that time  what next   i wonder  why not execute the poor beast scientifically  and not murder  him by inches      he moved his gun forward again as though bent on shooting  frank   however  would not let him raise the weapon      wait  i say  give bluff one more chance  make allowance for his  excitement and his position while the bear is shaking that tree so  if he  misses again we will both fire together and put an end to the comedy  before it turns into a tragedy       that s what it will be if bluff ever drops down into those claws  why  don t the duffer shoot  i can t stand it much longer  i tell you       hold hard  i ve no doubt he s waiting to get a good show  when the bear  stops rocking that tree for a second  there now      a sixth roar drowned frank s last words  this time bluff must have  steeled his nerves  and covered the side of the bear  for with the report  the animal keeled over  made a vain attempt to get up again  gave a few  kicks  and then lay still      hurrah  bluff has killed his bear   yelled frank  rushing forward  and  swinging his hat excitedly      come down here and stand over the fallen beast while i immortalize you  as the mightiest nimrod of them all   called will  rushing up with his  camera ready to do the business with neatness and dispatch     jerry said nothing  he looked a bit dejected as he stood there and  surveyed the dead bear  it was not envy that gripped his soul either  for  jerry was generous by nature  something else had seized upon him  and  frank smiled as though satisfied with the way things had come out     bluff came scrambling down from his uncertain perch  looking wild      is he really dead  fellows  just to think that after all i did it with  my new repeating shotgun  ain t it a dandy  though  if jerry hadn t gone  to work and hid it away  i might have downed all the game that s come  into this camp   he said  looking upon the black  hairy beast with a  shudder  for he had had quite a severe fright while swaying to and fro  with an angry bear beneath waiting for him to drop  like a ripe  persimmon  as jerry afterwards described it      jerry   shouted will  in blank amazement      yes  he stuck the gun in that long box over there  you remember his  falling over it and bruising his shins  that was what gave him the  miserable idea  i suppose  anyway  he did it while the rest of us were  out in the brush hunting for the fellow who threw those rocks into our  camp   declared bluff  scowling at the author of his woes     jerry laughed  a little forcedly it is true      i suppose i might as well own up  bluff  i m the guilty wretch  all  right  the temptation came to me  and i did the job without thinking what  it would mean to you  honestly i ve felt sore about it more than once  since  and had just about made up my mind to confess  when by some  accident  it seems  you found it  but you don t know it all  i hid the  gun and then  when i went to see if it was safe  it was gone  i didn t  know what to make of that  but fancied somebody else in camp had taken  it  then i commenced a search  and i found the gun down near that hole  i  rather think some of the lasher crowd came and took the gun  but i am not  sure  after i found the gun i brought it to camp and put it in the box  again  i take back some of the hard things i ve been saying about that  weapon  she can shoot  all right  and in the hands of an expert might   as i said  clean out all the game going       frank told me to take another look around  just before you fellows  left camp  i didn t have the heart to until a little while back  and  was delighted to find the gun under those pieces of canvas in the box   it wasn t wet a bit in that hot old storm we had  either   continued  bluff again  as be contemplated his quarry  and then puffed out with  honest pride      say  was it you shooting a little while back   asked will  just then    because we heard a lot of shots somewhere around       why  yes  i got uncle toby to stand behind a tree  and throw up the wash  basin half a dozen times while i banged away       yes   said frank  picking up the article in question   and to judge from  the holes you put through it we ll have to do without a basin during the  remainder of our stay in camp  but how do you suppose this bear wandered  into camp       reckons dat he jest smells de cawn  marse frank  w en i opens up de can   an  by gorry  dat b ar he can t resist de temptations to hab some  i seen  him comin  foh me  an  i jest lets out a yell an  runs up dis yer safety  ladder   remarked toby  as he patted the article in question  affectionately      we heard the yells  all right  and came running  look here  bluff  old  man  you got your bear in spite of my playing that mean trick on you   are you going to call it quits  and be friends   asked jerry  holding  out his hand      i  er  i don t know   stammered bluff      i am just as sorry as i can be  bluff  really i am  and i d give the  world if i hadn t played that trick  at first i was going to own up  but  when you went off after the lasher crowd it  well  i didn t see how i  could do it  but after i got it back i hoped every hour that you would  look into the box and discover the gun  oh  say you ll forgive me   added  jerry  pleadingly      well  i feel a bit raw about it yet  but this is no time to show  resentment  with such a glorious trophy at my feet  yes  we ll call it  quits  jerry  only after this you might forget to sneer at a gun that  happens to be different from yours       i agree  and that ends it   said jerry  as he squeezed the other s hand           chapter xxv    breaking camp      and they had bear steak for supper     honestly  none of them thought a great deal of the treat  only that it  seemed to be the proper thing for hunters to enjoy the results of their  prowess with their guns     bluff was the happiest chap in camp  unless will be excepted  he fondled  that recovered gun almost the whole evening  and while jerry winced every  time he saw it  he dared not lift up his voice in protest after the great  work which the so called gatling gun had done in the hands of a  greenhorn     jerry with all his skill in the line of shooting had never been given the  opportunity to kill a bear  and he felt that the time had gone by for him  to class bluff as a  come on      they spent a joyful evening  though  going over the exciting incidents of  the last forty eight hours again and again      and to think that we have only been up here a few days  boys  why  if  this sort of thing keeps on at this rate during our two weeks  stay   whatever in the world am i going to do for more films   asked will   plaintively      keep the balance for especially good subjects   said jerry  carelessly      yes  but sometimes  you know  the best pictures are those you fail to  get  now  there was that one with you hanging to that ladder  i ll never  get over my disappointment about losing that  whenever anything of that  sort crops up again  i hope nobody will steal my camera       talk to me about dogged perseverance  this fellow certainly has  em all  beat to a frazzle   said jerry  with an injured air   i expect next he ll  be proposing that we go back to that old shaft  and while i hang by my  teeth to that blessed  shaky ladder  he will crack off a few views of the  circus  don t you dare propose that  or i ll forget my promise to be  good  and begin to hide things again       oh  all right  i won t mention it  only it s a shame  that s what  when  any fellow in these days refuses to put himself out a little just to  oblige a friend  and interest posterity   grumbled will     they stayed up until quite late  singing songs of school and college  life  and having a happy time  not one among the four dreamed of the  shadow that was even then hovering over kamp kill kare     there was no alarm that night  for which one and all felt grateful  this  thing of being aroused out of a sound sleep to have the covers whipped  off by a roaring gale may read all very nice  but the reality is quite a  different matter  and when wild animals invade the peaceful camp it  strikes one as very funny in print  but is apt to bring about a chilly  feeling when encountered in real life     as usual  frank was the first one up  and he soon had the camp astir with  his cheery calls  the nipping  frosty air proclaimed that now the fall  had come in earnest  and that they would be glad after this to keep a  fire burning during each night  for warmth     as they sat about the blaze after breakfast  laying out plans for the  day  the sound of a horse s neigh startled them      it s the sheriff  i reckon   said jerry  as they jumped up     and he had guessed correctly  for presently they saw a horseman appear   and as he came up he waved his hand in greeting      sorry  boys  but i ve got some bad news for you   he said      anybody dead  or sick   asked frank  turning a bit pale      oh  no  nothing of that sort  i m glad to say  this concerns you fellows  only   was the quick reply of mr  dodd  the sheriff     the four boys looked at one another with alarm      i bet i know what it is  the head has concluded to start the school up  under half a roof  and wants us to come back right away   said will   mournfully     mr  dodd laughed aloud      hit it the first slat out of the box  will  and you ve got to report  to morrow morning  so you must go back to day sure  i saw some of your  fathers  and they say the same  so there s no escape  sorry to bring you  bad news  but looks like you ve been doing your share of game getting in  the short time you were here   nodding toward the bear that was hanging  up  and the deerskin  as well as the pelt of the invading wildcat      well  it s hard lines  sir  but i suppose we have to obey  but get off  and have breakfast  toby just loves to cook  you know  there s plenty of  coffee left  and you can have your choice of bear steak  or venison    said jerry  hospitably     so the sheriff made himself at home  he even assisted the boys get  their things together preparatory to moving back to town  before riding  on further     the motor cycles had been securely packed away under the big fly all this  time  and had not suffered at all from the rain  indeed  the boys took  good care to keep them well oiled  knowing the benefit of having such  valuable pieces of mechanism in first class order at all times     jerry went over to the farmer s and secured the horses and wagon  then  the work of dismantling kamp kill kare began  they tried to appear gay   but every one of the boys had become attached to the place during their  short stay  and felt badly over leaving these scenes with so much undone  that they had planned for      never mind  fellows  we re going to come again and again  this first  camp of the rod  gun and camera club isn t going to be the last  by any  means  and i guess we ve learned a good many things on this trip   sang  out jerry  cheerily      that s true every day  with all of us  i m learning all the time  and  next year when we get under canvas we will have a lot of pleasant  memories to look back to  why  with will s pictures to help out  the  winter will be a constant feast of stories about the things that have  happened to us up here   remarked frank      i d like to have seen more of old jesse  he s just chock full of woods  lore  and can give you all the points you want about animals and such   how are things getting on out there  fellows  is the wagon pretty well  loaded   asked jerry      have the last tent packed away in ten minutes  toby says he can drive  all right  but we ll keep near by to lend him a hand if necessary  the  road is some rough in places until we get on the pike      half an hour later the wagon moved away from the camp under the hemlocks   uncle toby looked back and grinned amiably as he noted his ladder of  protection  and his friendly tree of refuge     each boy in turn started his machine by walking  then vaulted into the  saddle  and began to move along the trail that led down to the lumber  camps at the head of the lake     no one said a word  in truth all were too full of emotion to speak  for  they felt this sudden flitting more than they cared to admit     a turn of the trail and no longer could they see the twin hemlocks under  which the two khaki tents had stood  frank had broken up many times in  his camping experiences and knew just how it felt  but the sensation was  new to the others  it was as if they had just lost a dear friend  as  though something had gone out of their lives that could never be  recovered again     now in advance of the trundling wagon  and anon bringing up the rear   they kept on until finally the opening at the lumber camp was gained   from now on their progress would be faster  and if they wished they could  leave toby to come along with the wagon while they opened up and made a  speedy run for home     somehow no one seemed to care about doing that  the wagon held something  that had been associated in their minds with the most delightful of  times  and they felt as though they ought to continue to act as a guard  of honor to the slow moving team      cheer up  fellows   called frank  seeing how gloomy his chums looked    every one of us has good reason for feeling proud and satisfied  even if  our vacation has been cut short  i know i m glad i came  i ve had just a  glorious time       and to think of the fine pictures i ll be developing to night  oh  don t  i hope they turn out good  though  frank  you promised to come around and  help me with your advice  i wouldn t take a chance of spoiling those  views for anything   said will  beginning to brighten up at the thought      and sure  i ought to be satisfied  with a deer  four wild dogs  and part  of a wildcat  too  as my portion   exclaimed jerry  also smiling again      well  what d ye think of me then  me and the blessed old pump gun you  used to make so much fun about  a bear  a great big savage bear that was  trying to shake me down out of that tree it s in the wagon  too  and all  our folks are going to try how sharp their teeth are when they get to  biting a genuine bear steak  i rather think i m in this thing some  eh   fellows   demanded bluff  positively      yes  i rather believe you lead the procession this time  bluff  go up  ahead  and do the grand marshal act when we get near home  but  say what  you will  boys  we did have glorious fun  i doubt whether any fellows  ever had more adventures crowded into so short a time before  and we re  all of the same mind  i take it  ready to try it again at the very first  opportunity   said frank     and how they did try it again will be told in another book  to be called   the outdoor chums on the lake  or  lively adventures on wildcat island    in that volume we shall meet all our young friends again  and likewise  their enemies  and follow out the particulars of some decidedly thrilling  happenings      before we get into civilization again  let s give one last rousing cheer  for good old kamp kill kare   cried jerry      hurrah  hurrah  hurrah  tiger   rang out four boyish voices  and then   waving an imaginary farewell to the pleasant camp under the hemlocks  the  outdoor chums turned once more to the duties of school life     the end            mother died when he was four years old   he was named   isaac after an uncle  who died in       bishop of st  asaph   young   isaac barrow was educated at the charterhouse school  and at   felstead  before he went  in       to cambridge   he entered first   at peterhouse  where his uncle isaac was a fellow  but at that time   his uncle was ejected from his fellowship for loyalty to the king s   cause  and removed to oxford  the nephew  who entered at cambridge    therefore avoided peterhouse  and went to trinity college   young   barrow s father also was at oxford  where he gave up all his worldly   means in service of the king     the young student at cambridge did not conceal his royalist feeling    but obtained  nevertheless  a scholarship at trinity  with some   exemptions from the puritan requirements of subscription   he took   his b a  degree in       and in      was elected to a fellowship of   trinity  on the same day with his most intimate college friend john   ray  the botanist   ray held in the next year several college   offices  was made in      lecturer in greek  and in      lecturer in   mathematics   barrow proceeded to his m a  in       and was admitted   to the same degree at oxford in        in       dr  dupont  who had   been tutor to barrow and ray  and held the university professorship   of greek  resigned  and used his interest  without success  to get   barrow appointed in his place   isaac barrow was then a young man of   four and twenty  with the courage of his opinions in politics and in   church questions  which were not the opinions of those in power     in      barrow left cambridge  having sold his books to raise money   for travel   he went to paris  where his father was with other   royalists  and gave some help to his father   then he went on to   italy  made stay at florence  and on a voyage from leghorn to smyrna   stood to a gun in fight with a pirate ship from algiers that was   beaten off   at college and upon his travels barrow was helped by   the liberality of public spirited men who thought him worth their   aid   he went on to constantinople  where he studied the greek   fathers of the church  and he spent more than a year in turkey   he   returned through germany and holland  reached england in the year   before the restoration  and then  at the age of twenty nine  he   entered holy orders  for which in all his studies he had been   preparing     the cambridge greek professorship  which had before been denied him    was obtained by barrow immediately after the restoration   soon   afterwards he was chosen to be professor of geometry at gresham   college   in      he preached the sermon in westminster abbey at the   consecration of his uncle  isaac  as bishop of st  asaph   in that   year also he became  at cambridge  the first lucasian professor of   mathematics  for which office he resigned his post at gresham   college     as lucasian professor of mathematics  isaac barrow had among his   pupils isaac newton   newton succeeded to the chair in        barrow   resigned because he feared that the duties of the mathematical chair   drew his thoughts too much from the duties of the pulpit  towards   the full performance of which he had desired all studies to be aids     he was then intent upon the writing of an  exposition of the creed    decalogue  and sacraments    he held a prebend in salisbury   cathedral  and a living in wales  that yielded little for his   support after the professorship had been resigned   but he was one   of the king s chaplains  was made d d  by the king in       and in        he was appointed master of trinity by charles ii   who said    when he appointed isaac barrow   that he gave the post to the best   scholar in england    barrow was vice chancellor of the university   when he died in       during a visit to london on the business of   his college     the sermons here given were first published in       in a volume   entitled  several sermons against evil speaking    that volume   contained ten sermons  of which the publisher said that  the two   last  against pragmaticalness and meddling in the affairs of others    do not so properly belong to this subject    the sermons here given   follow continuously  beginning with the second in the series   the   text of the first sermon was  if any man offend not in word  he is a   perfect man    the texts to the last three were    speak not evil   one of another  brethren    judge not   and  that ye study to be   quiet  and to do your own business      there were also published in       the year after barrow s death  a   sermon preached by him on the good friday before he died  a volume   of  twelve sermons preached upon several occasions   and the second   edition of a sermon on the  duty and reward of bounty to the poor      barrow s works were collected by archbishop tillotson  and   published  in four folio volumes  in the years             there   were other editions in three folios in       in       and in          dr  dibdin said of barrow that he  had the clearest head with which   mathematics ever endowed an individual  and one of the purest and   most unsophisticated hearts that ever beat in the human breast    in   these sermons against evil speaking he distinguishes as clearly as   shakespeare does between the playfulness of kindly mirth that draws   men nearer to each other and the words that make division   no man   was more free than isaac barrow from the spirit of unkindness   the   man speaks in these sermons   yet he could hold his own in wit with   the light triflers of the court of charles the second   it is of him   that the familiar story is told of a playful match at mock courtesy   with the earl of rochester  who meeting dr  barrow near the king s   chamber bowed low  saying   i am yours  doctor  to the knee   strings    barrow  bowing lower    i am yours  my lord  to the shoe   tie    rochester    yours  doctor  down to the ground    barrow      yours  my lord  to the centre of the earth    rochester  not to be   out done     yours  doctor  to the lowest pit of hell    barrow      there  my lord  i must leave you      barrow s mathematical power gave clearness to his sermons  which   were full of sense and piety   they were very carefully written    copied and recopied  and now rank with the most valued pieces of the   literature of the pulpit   he was deeply religious  although he had    besides learning  a lively wit  and never lost the pluck that taught   him how to man a gun against a pirate   he was  low of stature    lean  and of a pale complexion   so untidy that on one occasion his   appearance in the pulpit is said to have caused half the   congregation to go out of church   he gave his whole mind and his   whole soul to his work for god   mythical tales are told of the   length of some of his sermons  at a time when an hour s sermon was   not considered long   of one charity sermon the story is that it   lasted three hours and a half  and that barrow was requested to   print it   with the other half which he had not had time to   deliver    but we may take this tale as one of the quips at which   barrow himself would have laughed very good humouredly                                                h  m           sermons on evil speaking           against foolish talking and jesting          nor foolish talking  nor jesting  which are not convenient      ephes  v       moral and political aphorisms are seldom couched in such terms that   they should be taken as they sound precisely  or according to the   widest extent of signification  but do commonly need exposition  and   admit exception   otherwise frequently they would not only clash   with reason and experience  but interfere  thwart  and supplant one   another   the best masters of such wisdom are wont to interdict   things  apt by unseasonable or excessive use to be perverted  in   general forms of speech  leaving the restrictions  which the case   may require or bear  to be made by the hearer s or interpreter s   discretion  whence many seemingly formal prohibitions are to be   received only as sober cautions   this observation may be   particularly supposed applicable to this precept of st  paul  which   seemeth universally to forbid a practice commended  in some cases   and degrees  by philosophers as virtuous  not disallowed by reason    commonly affected by men  often used by wise and good persons  from   which consequently  if our religion did wholly debar us  it would   seem chargeable with somewhat too uncouth austerity and sourness     from imputations of which kind as in its temper and frame it is   really most free  it never quenching natural light or cancelling the   dictates of sound reason  but confirming and improving them   so it   carefully declineth them  enjoining us that  if there be any things     greek    lovely   or grateful to men    any things   greek    of   good report  and repute    if there be any virtue and any praise     anything in the common apprehensions of men held worthy and   laudable   we should  mind those things   that is  should yield them   a regard answerable to the esteem they carry among rational and   sober persons     whence it may seem requisite so to interpret and determine st    paul s meaning here concerning eutrapelia  that is  facetious   speech  or raillery  by our translators rendered  jesting    that he   may consist with himself  and be reconciled to aristotle  who   placeth this practice in the rank of virtues  or that religion and   reason may well accord in the case   supposing that  if there be any   kind of facetiousness innocent and reasonable  conformable to good   manners  regulated by common sense  and consistent with the tenor of   christian duty  that is  not transgressing the bounds of piety    charity  and sobriety   st  paul did not intend to discountenance or   prohibit that kind     for thus expounding and limiting his intent we have some warrant   from himself  some fair intimations in the words here   for first    what sort of facetious speech he aimeth at  he doth imply by the   fellow he coupleth therewith   greek   saith he   greek   foolish   talking  or facetiousness    such facetiousness therefore he   toucheth as doth include folly  in the matter or manner thereof     then he further determineth it  by adjoining a peculiar quality   thereof  unprofitableness  or impertinency   greek   which are not   pertinent   or conducible to any good purpose   whence may be   collected that it is a frivolous and idle sort of facetiousness   which he condemneth     but  however  manifest it is that some kind thereof he doth   earnestly forbid   whence  in order to the guidance of our practice    it is needful to distinguish the kinds  severing that which is   allowable from that which is unlawful  that so we may be satisfied   in the case  and not on the one hand ignorantly transgress our duty    nor on the other trouble ourselves with scruples  others with   censures  upon the use of warrantable liberty therein     and such a resolution seemeth indeed especially needful in this our   age  this pleasant and jocular age  which is so infinitely addicted   to this sort of speaking  that it scarce doth affect or prize   anything near so much  all reputation appearing now to veil and   stoop to that of being a wit   to be learned  to be wise  to be   good  are nothing in comparison thereto  even to be noble and rich   are inferior things  and afford no such glory   many at least  to   purchase this glory  to be deemed considerable in this faculty  and   enrolled among the wits  do not only make shipwreck of conscience    abandon virtue  and forfeit all pretences to wisdom  but neglect   their estates  and prostitute their honour   so to the private   damage of many particular persons  and with no small prejudice to   the public  are our times possessed and transported with this   humour   to repress the excess and extravagance whereof  nothing in   way of discourse can serve better than a plain declaration when and   how such a practice is allowable or tolerable  when it is wicked and   vain  unworthy of a man endued with reason  and pretending to   honesty or honour     this i shall in some measure endeavour to perform     but first it may be demanded what the thing we speak of is  or what   this facetiousness doth import   to which question i might reply as   democritus did to him that asked the definition of a man    tis that   which we all see and know    any one better apprehends what it is by   acquaintance than i can inform him by description   it is indeed a   thing so versatile and multiform  appearing in so many shapes  so   many postures  so many garbs  so variously apprehended by several   eyes and judgments  that it seemeth no less hard to settle a clear   and certain notion thereof  than to make a portrait of proteus  or   to define the figure of the fleeting air   sometimes it lieth in pat   allusion to a known story  or in seasonable application of a trivial   saying  or in forging an apposite tale   sometimes it playeth in   words and phrases  taking advantage from the ambiguity of their   sense  or the affinity of their sound   sometimes it is wrapped in a   dress of humorous expression  sometimes it lurketh under an odd   similitude  sometimes it is lodged in a sly question  in a smart   answer  in a quirkish reason  in a shrewd intimation  in cunningly   diverting  or cleverly retorting an objection   sometimes it is   couched in a bold scheme of speech  in a tart irony  in a lusty   hyperbole  in a startling metaphor  in a plausible reconciling of   contradictions  or in acute nonsense   sometimes a scenical   representation of persons or things  a counterfeit speech  a mimical   look or gesture passeth for it   sometimes an affected simplicity    sometimes a presumptuous bluntness giveth it being  sometimes it   riseth from a lucky hitting upon what is strange  sometimes from a   crafty wresting obvious matter to the purpose   often it consisteth   in one knows not what  and springeth up one can hardly tell how     its ways are unaccountable and inexplicable  being answerable to the   numberless rovings of fancy and windings of language   it is in   short  a manner of speaking out of the simple and plain way  such as   reason teacheth and proveth things by   which by a pretty surprising   uncouthness in conceit or expression doth affect and amuse the   fancy  stirring in it some wonder  and breeding some delight   thereto   it raiseth admiration  as signifying a nimble sagacity of   apprehension  a special felicity of invention  a vivacity of spirit    and reach of wit more than vulgar   it seeming to argue a rare   quickness of parts  that one can fetch in remote conceits   applicable  a notable skill  that he can dexterously accommodate   them to the purpose before him  together with a lively briskness of   humour  not apt to damp those sportful flashes of imagination      whence in aristotle such persons are termed  greek   dexterous men    and  greek   men of facile or versatile manners  who can easily turn   themselves to all things  or turn all things to themselves   it also   procureth delight  by gratifying curiosity with its rareness or   semblance of difficulty  as monsters  not for their beauty  but   their rarety  as juggling tricks  not for their use  but their   abstruseness  are beheld with pleasure  by diverting the mind from   its road of serious thoughts  by instilling gaiety and airiness of   spirit  by provoking to such dispositions of spirit in way of   emulation or complaisance  and by seasoning matters  otherwise   distasteful or insipid  with an unusual  and thence grateful tang     but saying no more concerning what it is  and leaving it to your   imagination and experience to supply the defect of such explication    i shall address myself to show  first  when and how such a manner of   speaking may be allowed  then  in what matters and ways it should be   condemned           such facetiousness is not absolutely unreasonable or unlawful    which ministereth harmless divertisement  and delight to   conversation  harmless  i say  that is  not entrenching upon piety    not infringing charity or justice  not disturbing peace    for   christianity is not so tetrical  so harsh  so envious  as to bar us   continually from innocent  much less from wholesome and useful   pleasure  such as human life doth need or require   and if jocular   discourse may serve to good purposes of this kind  if it may be apt   to raise our drooping spirits  to allay our irksome cares  to whet   our blunted industry  to recreate our minds being tired and cloyed   with graver occupations  if it may breed alacrity  or maintain good   humour among us  if it may conduce to sweeten conversation and   endear society  then is it not inconvenient  or unprofitable   if   for those ends we may use other recreations  employing on them our   ears and eyes  our hands and feet  our other instruments of sense   and motion  why may we not as well to them accommodate our organs of   speech and interior sense   why should those games which excite our   wits and fancies be less reasonable than those whereby our grosser   parts and faculties are exercised   yea  why are not those more   reasonable  since they are performed in a manly way  and have in   them a smack of reason  feeling also they may be so managed  as not   only to divert and please  but to improve and profit the mind    rousing and quickening it  yea sometimes enlightening and   instructing it  by good sense conveyed in jocular expression     it would surely be hard that we should be tied ever to knit the   brow  and squeeze the brain  to be always sadly dumpish  or   seriously pensive   that all divertisement of mirth and pleasantness   should be shut out of conversation  and how can we better relieve   our minds  or relax our thoughts  how can we be more ingenuously   cheerful  in what more kindly way can we exhilarate ourselves and   others  than by thus sacrificing to the graces  as the ancients   called it   are not some persons always  and all persons sometimes    incapable otherwise to divert themselves  than by such discourse     shall we  i say  have no recreation  or must our recreations be ever   clownish  or childish  consisting merely in rustical efforts  or in   petty sleights of bodily strength and activity   were we  in fine    obliged ever to talk like philosophers  assigning dry reasons for   everything  and dropping grave sentences upon all occasions  would   it not much deaden human life  and make ordinary conversation   exceedingly to languish   facetiousness therefore in such cases  and   to such purposes  may be allowable         facetiousness is allowable when it is the most proper instrument   of exposing things apparently base and vile to due contempt   it is   many times expedient  that things really ridiculous should appear   such  that they may be sufficiently loathed and shunned  and to   render them such is the part of a facetious wit  and usually can   only be compassed thereby   when to impugn them with down right   reason  or to check them by serious discourse  would signify   nothing  then representing them in a shape strangely ugly to the   fancy  and thereby raising derision at them  may effectually   discountenance them   thus did the prophet elias expose the wicked   superstition of those who worshipped baal    elias  saith the text    mocked them  and said   cry aloud  for he is a god  either he is   talking  or he is pursuing  or he is in a journey  or peradventure   he sleeps  and must be awaked     by which one pregnant instance it   appeareth that reasoning pleasantly abusive in some cases may be   useful   the holy scripture doth not indeed use it frequently  it   not suiting the divine simplicity and stately gravity thereof to do   so   yet its condescension thereto at any time sufficiently doth   authorise a cautious use thereof   when sarcastic twitches are   needful to pierce the thick skins of men  to correct their lethargic   stupidity  to rouse them out of their drowsy negligence  then may   they well be applied when plain declarations will not enlighten   people to discern the truth and weight of things  and blunt   arguments will not penetrate to convince or persuade them to their   duty  then doth reason freely resign its place to wit  allowing it   to undertake its work of instruction and reproof         facetious discourse particularly may be commodious for reproving   some vices  and reclaiming some persons  as salt for cleansing and   curing some sores    it commonly procureth a more easy access to the   ears of men  and worketh a stronger impression on their hearts  than   other discourse could do   many who will not stand a direct reproof    and cannot abide to be plainly admonished of their fault  will yet   endure to be pleasantly rubbed  and will patiently bear a jocund   wipe  though they abominate all language purely bitter or sour  yet   they can relish discourse having in it a pleasant tartness   you   must not chide them as their master  but you may gibe with them as   their companion   if you do that  they will take you for pragmatical   and haughty  this they may interpret friendship and freedom   most   men are of that temper  and particularly the genius of divers   persons  whose opinions and practices we should strive to correct    doth require not a grave and severe  but a free and merry way of   treating them   for what can be more unsuitable and unpromising    than to seem serious with those who are not so themselves  or demure   with the scornful   if we design either to please or vex them into   better manners  we must be as sportful in a manner  or as   contemptuous as themselves   if we mean to be heard by them  we must   talk in their own fashion  with humour and jollity  if we will   instruct them  we must withal somewhat divert them   we must seem to   play with them if we think to convey any sober thoughts into them     they scorn to be formally advised or taught  but they may perhaps be   slily laughed and lured into a better mind   if by such complaisance   we can inveigle those dottrels to hearken to us  we may induce them   to consider farther  and give reason some competent scope  some fair   play with them   good reason may be apparelled in the garb of wit    and therein will securely pass whither in its native homeliness it   could never arrive   and being come thither  it with especial   advantage may impress good advice  making an offender more clearly   to see  and more deeply to feel his miscarriage  being represented   to his fancy in a strain somewhat rare and remarkable  yet not so   fierce and frightful   the severity of reproof is tempered  and the   reprover s anger disguised thereby   the guilty person cannot but   observe that he who thus reprehends him is not disturbed or out of   humour  and that he rather pitieth than hateth him  which breedeth a   veneration to him  and imparteth no small efficacy to his wholesome   suggestions   such a reprehension  while it forceth a smile without    doth work remorse within  while it seemeth to tickle the ear  doth   sting the heart   in fine  many whose foreheads are brazed and   hearts steeled against all blame  are yet not of proof against   derision  divers  who never will be reasoned  may be rallied in   better order   in which cases raillery  as an instrument of so   important good  as a servant of the best charity  may be allowed         some errors likewise in this way may be most properly and most   successfully confuted  such as deserve not  and hardly can bear a   serious and solid confutation   he that will contest things   apparently decided by sense and experience  or who disavows clear   principles of reason  approved by general consent and the common   sense of men  what other hopeful way is there of proceeding with   him  than pleasantly to explode his conceits   to dispute seriously   with him were trifling  to trifle with him is the proper course     since he rejecteth the grounds of reasoning   tis vain to be in   earnest  what then remains but to jest with him   to deal seriously   were to yield too much respect to such a baffler  and too much   weight to his fancies  to raise the man too high in his courage and   conceit  to make his pretences seem worthy the considering and   canvassing   briefly  perverse obstinacy is more easily quelled    petulant impudence is sooner dashed  sophistical captiousness is   more safely eluded  sceptical wantonness is more surely confounded   in this than in the simple way of discourse         this way is also commonly the best way of defence against unjust   reproach and obloquy   to yield to a slanderous reviler a serious   reply  or to make a formal plea against his charge  doth seem to   imply that we much consider or deeply resent it  whereas by pleasant   reflection on it we signify the matter only deserves contempt  and   that we take ourselves unconcerned therein   so easily without care   or trouble may the brunts of malice be declined or repelled         this may be allowed in way of counterbalancing and in compliance   to the fashion of others   it would be a disadvantage unto truth and   virtue if their defenders were barred from the use of this weapon    since it is that especially whereby the patrons of error and vice do   maintain and propagate them   they being destitute of good reason    do usually recommend their absurd and pestilent notions by a   pleasantness of conceit and expression  bewitching the fancies of   shallow hearers  and inveigling heedless persons to a liking of   them  and if  for reclaiming such people  the folly of those   seducers may in like manner be displayed as ridiculous and odious    why should that advantage be refused   it is wit that wageth the war   against reason  against virtue  against religion  wit alone it is   that perverteth so many  and so greatly corrupteth the world   it   may  therefore  be needful  in our warfare for those dearest   concerns  to sort the manner of our fighting with that of our   adversaries  and with the same kind of arms to protect goodness    whereby they do assail it   if wit may happily serve under the   banner of truth and virtue  we may impress it for that service  and   good it were to rescue so worthy a faculty from so vile abuse   it   is the right of reason and piety to command that and all other   endowments  folly and impiety do only usurp them   just and fit   therefore it is to wrest them out of so bad hands  to revoke them to   their right use and duty     it doth especially seem requisite to do it in this age  wherein   plain reason is deemed a dull and heavy thing   when the mental   appetite of men is become like the corporal  and cannot relish any   food without some piquant sauce  so that people will rather starve   than live on solid fare  when substantial and sound discourse   findeth small attention or acceptance  in such a time  he that can    may in complaisance  and for fashion s sake  vouchsafe to be   facetious  an ingenious vein coupled with an honest mind may be a   good talent  he shall employ wit commendably who by it can further   the interests of goodness  alluring men first to listen  then   inducing them to consent unto its wholesome dictates and precepts     since men are so irreclaimably disposed to mirth and laughter  it   may be well to set them in the right pin  to divert their humour   into the proper channel  that they may please themselves in deriding   things which deserve it  ceasing to laugh at that which requireth   reverence or horror     it may also be expedient to put the world out of conceit that all   sober and good men are a sort of such lumpish or sour people that   they can utter nothing but flat and drowsy stuff  by showing them   that such persons  when they see cause  in condescension  can be as   brisk and smart as themselves  when they please  can speak   pleasantly and wittily  as well as gravely and judiciously   this   way at least  in respect to the various palates of men  may for   variety sake be sometimes attempted  when other means do fail  when   many strict and subtle arguings  many zealous declamations  many   wholesome serious discourses have been spent  without effecting the   extirpation of bad principles  or conversion of those who abet them    this course may be tried  and some perhaps may be reclaimed thereby         furthermore  the warrantableness of this practice in some cases   may be inferred from a parity of reason  in this manner   if it be   lawful  as by the best authorities it plainly doth appear to be   in   using rhetorical schemes  poetical strains  involutions of sense in   allegories  fables  parables  and riddles  to discoast from the   plain and simple way of speech  why may not facetiousness  issuing   from the same principles  directed to the same ends  serving to like   purposes  be likewise used blamelessly   if those exorbitancies of   speech may be accommodated to instill good doctrine into the head    to excite good passions in the heart  to illustrate and adorn the   truth  in a delightful and taking way  and facetious discourse be   sometimes notoriously conducible to the same ends  why  they being   retained  should it be rejected  especially considering how   difficult often it may be to distinguish those forms of discourse   from this  or exactly to define the limits which sever rhetoric and   raillery   some elegant figures and trophies of rhetoric  biting   sarcasms  sly ironies  strong metaphors  lofty hyperboles    paronomasies  oxymorons  and the like  frequently used by the best   speakers  and not seldom even by sacred writers  do lie very near   upon the confines of jocularity  and are not easily differenced from   those sallies of wit wherein the lepid way doth consist   so that   were this wholly culpable  it would be matter of scruple whether one   hath committed a fault or no when he meant only to play the orator   or the poet  and hard surely it would be to find a judge who could   precisely set out the difference between a jest and a flourish         i shall only add  that of old even the sagest and gravest   persons  persons of most rigid and severe virtue  did much affect   this kind of discourse  and did apply it to noble purposes   the   great introducer of moral wisdom among the pagans did practise it so   much  by it repressing the windy pride and fallacious vanity of   sophisters in his time   that he thereby got the name of  greek     the droll  and the rest of those who pursued his design do  by   numberless stories and apophthegms recorded of them  appear well   skilled and much delighted in this way   many great princes  as   augustus caesar  for one  many of whose jests are extant in   macrobius   many grave statesmen  as cicero particularly  who   composed several books of jests   many famous captains  as fabius    m  cato the censor  scipio africanus  epaminondas  themistocles    phocion  and many others  whose witty sayings together with their   martial exploits are reported by historians   have pleased   themselves herein  and made it a condiment of their weighty   businesses   so that practising thus  within certain rule and   compass   we cannot err without great patterns  and mighty patrons         in fine  since it cannot be shown that such a sportfulness of   wit and fancy doth contain an intrinsic and inseparable turpitude    since it may be so cleanly  handsomely  and innocently used  as not   to defile or discompose the mind of the speaker  nor to wrong or   harm the hearer  nor to derogate from any worthy subject of   discourse  nor to infringe decency  to disturb peace  to violate any   of the grand duties incumbent on us  piety  charity  justice    sobriety   but rather sometimes may yield advantage in those   respects  it cannot well absolutely and universally be condemned     and when not used upon improper matter  in an unfit manner  with   excessive measure  at undue season  to evil purpose  it may be   allowed   it is bad objects  or bad adjuncts  which do spoil its   indifference and innocence  it is the abuse thereof  to which  as   all pleasant things are dangerous  and apt to degenerate into baits   of intemperance and excess  it is very liable  that corrupteth it    and seemeth to be the ground why in so general terms it is   prohibited by the apostle   which prohibition to what cases  or what   sorts of jesting it extendeth  we come now to declare       ii       all profane jesting  all speaking loosely and wantonly   about holy things  things nearly related to god and religion     making such things the matters of sport and mockery  playing and   trifling with them  is certainly prohibited  as an intolerably vain   and wicked practice   it is an infallible sign of a vain and light   spirit  which considereth little  and cannot distinguish things  to   talk slightly concerning persons of high dignity  to whom especial   respect is due  or about matters of great importance  which deserve   very serious consideration   no man speaketh  or should speak  of   his prince  that which he hath not weighed whether it will consist   with that veneration which should be preserved inviolate to him     and is not the same  is not much greater care to be used in regard   to the incomparably great and glorious majesty of heaven   yes    surely  as we should not without great awe think of him  so we   should not presume to mention his name  his word  his institutions    anything immediately belonging to him  without profoundest reverence   and dread   it is the most enormous sauciness that can be imagined    to speak petulantly or pertly concerning him  especially considering   that whatever we do say about him  we do utter it in his presence    and to his very face    for there is not   as the holy psalmist   considered   a word in my tongue  but lo  o lord  thou knowest it   altogether    no man also hath the heart to droll  or thinks   raillery convenient  in cases nearly touching his life  his health    his estate  or his fame   and are the true life and health of our   soul  are interests in god s favour and mercy  are everlasting glory   and bliss affairs of less moment  are the treasures and joys of   paradise  or the damages and torments in hell  more jesting matters     no  certainly no   in all reason therefore it becometh us  and it   infinitely concerneth us  whenever we think of these things  to be   in best earnest  always to speak of them in most sober sadness     the proper objects of common mirth and sportful divertisement are   mean and petty matters  anything at least is by playing therewith   made such   great things are thereby diminished and debased    especially sacred things do grievously suffer thence  being with   extreme indecency and indignity depressed beneath themselves  when   they become the subjects of flashy wit  or the entertainments of   frothy merriment   to sacrifice their honour to our vain pleasure    being like the ridiculous fondness of that people which  as aelian   reporteth  worshipping a fly  did offer up an ox thereto   these   things were by god instituted  and proposed to us for purposes quite   different  to compose our hearts  and settle our fancies in a most   serious frame  to breed inward satisfaction  and joy purely   spiritual  to exercise our most solemn thoughts  and employ our   gravest discourses   all our speech therefore about them should be   wholesome  apt to afford good instruction  or to excite good   affections   good   as st  paul speaketh   for the use of edifying    that it may minister grace unto the hearers      if we must be facetious and merry  the field is wide and spacious    there are matters enough in the world besides these most august and   dreadful things  to try our faculties and please our humour with    everywhere light and ludicrous things occur  it therefore doth argue   a marvellous poverty of wit  and barrenness of invention  no less   than a strange defect of goodness  and want of discretion   in those   who can devise no other subjects to frolic upon besides these  of   all most improper and perilous  who cannot seem ingenious under the   charge of so highly trespassing upon decency  disclaiming wisdom    wounding the ears of others  and their own consciences   seem   ingenious  i say  for seldom those persons really are such  or are   capable to discover any wit in a wise and manly way    tis not the   excellency of their fancies  which in themselves are usually sorry   and insipid enough  but the uncouthness of their presumption  not   their extraordinary wit  but their prodigious rashness  which is to   be admired   they are gazed on  as the doers of bold tricks  who   dare perform that which no sober man will attempt   they do indeed   rather deserve themselves to be laughed at  than their conceits     for what can be more ridiculous than we do make ourselves  when we   thus fiddle and fool with our own souls  when  to make vain people   merry  we incense god s earnest displeasure  when  to raise a fit of   present laughter  we expose ourselves to endless wailing and woe    when  to be reckoned wits  we prove ourselves stark wild   surely to   this case we may accommodate that of a truly great wit  king   solomon    i said of laughter  it is mad  and of mirth  what doeth   it          all injurious  abusive  scurrilous jesting  which causelessly or   needlessly tendeth to the disgrace  damage  vexation  or prejudice   in any kind of our neighbour  provoking his displeasure  grating on   his modesty  stirring passion in him   is also prohibited   when   men  to raise an admiration of their wit  to please themselves  or   gratify the humours of other men  do expose their neighbour to scorn   and contempt  making ignominious reflections upon his person and his   actions  taunting his real imperfections  or fastening imaginary   ones upon him  they transgress their duty  and abuse their wits     tis not urbanity  or genuine facetiousness  but uncivil rudeness or   vile malignity   to do thus  as it is the office of mean and base   spirits  unfit for any worthy or weighty employments   so it is full   of inhumanity  of iniquity  of indecency and folly   for the   weaknesses of men  of what kind soever  natural or moral  in quality   or in act   considering whence they spring  and how much we are all   subject to them  and do need excuse for them  do in equity challenge   compassion to be had of them  not complacency to be taken in them    or mirth drawn from them  they  in respect to common humanity    should rather be studiously connived at  and concealed  or mildly   excused  than wilfully laid open  and wantonly descanted upon  they   rather are to be deplored secretly  than openly derided     the reputation of men is too noble a sacrifice to be offered up to   vainglory  fond pleasure  or ill humour  it is a good far more dear   and precious  than to be prostituted for idle sport and   divertisement   it becometh us not to trifle with that which in   common estimation is of so great moment  to play rudely with a thing   so very brittle  yet of so vast price  which being once broken or   cracked  it is very hard and scarce possible to repair   a small    transient pleasure  a tickling the ears  wagging the lungs  forming   the face into a smile  a giggle  or a hum  are not to be purchased   with the grievous distaste and smart  perhaps with the real damage   and mischief of our neighbour  which attend upon contempt   this is   not jesting  surely  but bad earnest   tis wild mirth  which is the   mother of grief to those whom we should tenderly love   tis   unnatural sport  which breedeth displeasure in them whose delight it   should promote  whose liking it should procure   it crosseth the   nature and design of this way of speaking  which is to cement and   ingratiate society  to render conversation pleasant and sprightly    for mutual satisfaction and comfort     true festivity is called salt  and such it should be  giving a smart   but savoury relish to discourse  exciting an appetite  not   irritating disgust  cleansing sometimes  but never creating a sore     and  greek    if it become thus insipid   or unsavoury  it is   therefore good for nothing  but to be cast out  and trodden under   foot of men   such jesting which doth not season wholesome or   harmless discourse  but giveth a haut gout to putrid and poisonous   stuff  gratifying distempered palates and corrupt stomachs  is   indeed odious and despicable folly  to be cast out with loathing  to   be trodden under foot with contempt   if a man offends in this sort    to please himself   tis scurvy malignity  if to delight others   tis   base servility and flattery   upon the first score he is a buffoon   to himself  upon the last  a fool to others   and well in common   speech are such practisers so termed  the grounds of that practice   being so vain  and the effect so unhappy   the heart of fools  saith   the wise man  is in the house of mirth  meaning  it seems    especially such hurtfully wanton mirth   for it is  as he further   telleth us  the property of fools to delight in doing harm   it is   as sport to a fool to do mischief     is it not in earnest most   palpable folly  for so mean ends to do so great harm  to disoblige   men in sport  to lose friends and get enemies for a conceit  out of   a light humour to provoke fierce wrath  and breed tough hatred  to   engage one s self consequently very far in strife  danger  and   trouble   no way certainly is more apt to produce such effects than   this  nothing more speedily inflameth  or more thoroughly engageth   men  or sticketh longer in men s hearts and memories  than bitter   taunts and scoffs   whence this honey soon turns into gall  these   jolly comedies do commonly terminate in woeful tragedies     especially this scurrilous and scoffing way is then most detestable   when it not only exposeth the blemishes and infirmities of men  but   abuseth piety and virtue themselves  flouting persons for their   constancy in devotion  or their strict adherence to a conscientious   practice of duty  aiming to effect that which job complaineth of     the just upright man is laughed to scorn   resembling those whom   the psalmist thus describeth   who whet their tongue like a sword    and bend their arrows  even bitter words  that they may shoot in   secret at the perfect   serving good men as jeremy was served   the   word of the lord   saith he   was made a reproach unto me  and a   derision daily      this practice doth evidently in the highest degree tend to the   disparagement and discouragement of goodness  aiming to expose it    and to render men ashamed thereof  and it manifestly proceedeth from   a desperate corruption of mind  from a mind hardened and emboldened    sold and enslaved to wickedness   whence they who deal therein are   in holy scripture represented as egregious sinners  or persons   superlatively wicked  under the name of scorners   greek   pests  or   pestilent men  the greek translators call them  properly enough in   regard to the effects of their practice   concerning whom the wise   man  signifying how god will meet with them in their own way  saith     surely the lord scorneth the scorners      greek   scoffers  or   mockers   st  peter termeth them  who walk according to their own   lusts  who not being willing to practise  are ready to deride   virtue  thereby striving to seduce others into their pernicious   courses     this offence also proportionably groweth more criminal as it   presumeth to reach persons eminent in dignity or worth  unto whom   special veneration is appropriate   this adjoineth sauciness to   scurrility  and advanceth the wrong thereof into a kind of   sacrilege    tis not only injustice  but profaneness  to abuse the   gods   their station is a sanctuary from all irreverence and   reproach  they are seated on high  that we may only look up to them   with respect  their defects are not to be seen  or not to be touched   by malicious or wanton wits  by spiteful or scornful tongues   the   diminution of their credit is a public mischief  and the state   itself doth suffer in their becoming objects of scorn  not only   themselves are vilified and degraded  but the great affairs they   manage are obstructed  the justice they administer is disparaged   thereby     in fine  no jesting is allowable which is not thoroughly innocent     it is an unworthy perverting of wit to employ it in biting and   scratching  in working prejudice to any man s reputation or   interest  in needlessly incensing any man s anger or sorrow  in   raising animosities  dissensions  and feuds among any     whence it is somewhat strange that any men from so mean and silly a   practice should expect commendation  or that any should afford   regard thereto  the which it is so far from meriting  that indeed   contempt and abhorrence are due to it   men do truly more render   themselves despicable than others when  without just ground  or   reasonable occasion  they do attack others in this way   that such a   practice doth ever find any encouragement or acceptance  whence can   it proceed  but from the bad nature and small judgment of some   persons   for to any man who is endowed with any sense of goodness    and hath a competence of true wit  or a right knowledge of good   manners  who knows        inurbanum lepido seponere dicto   it   cannot but be unsavoury and loathsome   the repute it obtaineth is   in all respects unjust   so would it appear  not only were the cause   to be decided in a court of morality  because it consists not with   virtue and wisdom  but even before any competent judges of wit   itself   for he overthrows his own pretence  and cannot reasonably   claim any interest in wit  who doth thus behave himself   he   prejudgeth himself to want wit  who cannot descry fit matter to   divert himself or others   he discovereth a great straitness and   sterility of good invention  who cannot in all the wide field of   things find better subjects of discourse  who knows not how to be   ingenious within reasonable compass  but to pick up a sorry conceit   is forced to make excursions beyond the bounds of honesty and   decency     neither is it any argument of considerable ability in him that haps   to please this way   a slender faculty will serve the turn   the   sharpness of his speech cometh not from wit so much as from choler    which furnisheth the lowest inventions with a kind of pungent   expression  and giveth an edge to every spiteful word   so that any   dull wretch doth seem to scold eloquently and ingeniously   commonly   also satirical taunts do owe their seeming piquancy  not to the   speaker or his words  but to the subject  and the hearers  the   matter conspiring with the bad nature or the vanity of men who love   to laugh at any rate  and to be pleased at the expense of other   men s repute  conceiting themselves extolled by the depression of   their neighbour  and hoping to gain by his loss   such customers   they are that maintain the bitter wits  who otherwise would want   trade  and might go a begging   for commonly they who seem to excel   this way are miserably flat in other discourse  and most dully   serious   they have a particular unaptness to describe any good   thing  or commend any worthy person  being destitute of right ideas    and proper terms answerable to such purposes   their representations   of that kind are absurd and unhandsome  their eulogies  to use their   own way of speaking  are in effect satires  and they can hardly more   abuse a man than by attempting to commend him  like those in the   prophet  who were wise to do ill  but to do well had no knowledge         i pass by that it is very culpable to be facetious in obscene   and smutty matters   such things are not to be discoursed on either   in jest or in earnest  they must not  as st  paul saith  be so much   as named among christians   to meddle with them is not to disport    but to defile one s self and others   there is indeed no more   certain sign of a mind utterly debauched from piety and virtue than   by affecting such talk   but further          all unseasonable jesting is blamable   as there are some proper   seasons of relaxation  when we may desipere in loco  so there are   some times  and circumstances of things  wherein it concerneth and   becometh men to be serious in mind  grave in demeanour  and plain in   discourse  when to sport in this way is to do indecently or   uncivilly  to be impertinent or troublesome     it comporteth not well with the presence of superiors  before whom   it becometh us to be composed and modest  much less with the   performance of sacred offices  which require an earnest attention    and most serious frame of mind     in deliberations and debates about affairs of great importance  the   simple manner of speaking to the point is the proper  easy  clear    and compendious way   facetious speech there serves only to obstruct   and entangle business  to lose time  and protract the result   the   shop and exchange will scarce endure jesting in their lower   transactions   the senate  the court of justice  the church do much   more exclude it from their more weighty consultations   whenever it   justleth out  or hindereth the despatch of other serious business    taking up the room or swallowing the time due to it  or indisposing   the minds of the audience to attend it  then it is unseasonable and   pestilent    greek   to play  that we may be seriously busy   is the   good rule  of anacharsis   implying the subordination of sport to   business  as a condiment and furtherance  not an impediment or clog   thereto   he that for his sport neglects his business  deserves   indeed to be reckoned among children  and children s fortune will   attend him  to be pleased with toys  and to fail of substantial   profit      tis again improper  because indeed uncivil  and inhuman  to jest   with persons that are in a sad or afflicted condition  as arguing   want of due considering or due commiserating their case   it appears   a kind of insulting upon their misfortune  and is apt to foment   their grief   even in our own case  upon any disastrous occurrence   to ourselves   it would not be seemly to frolic it thus  it would   signify want of due regard to the frowns of god  and the strokes of   his hand  it would cross the wise man s advice   in the day of   prosperity be joyful  but in the day of adversity consider      it is also not seasonable  or civil  to be jocund in this way with   those who desire to be serious  and like not the humour   jocularity   should not be forcibly obtruded  but by a kindly conspiracy  or   tacit compact  slip into conversation  consent and complaisance give   all the life thereto   its design is to sweeten and ease society    when to the contrary it breedeth offence or encumbrance  it is worse   than vain and unprofitable   from these instances we may collect   when in other like cases it is unseasonable  and therefore culpable     further          to affect  admire  or highly to value this way of speaking    either absolutely in itself  or in comparison to the serious and   plain way of speech   and thence to be drawn into an immoderate use   thereof  is blamable   a man of ripe age and sound judgment  for   refreshment to himself  or in complaisance to others  may sometimes   condescend to play in this  or any other harmless way  but to be   fond of it  to prosecute it with a careful or painful eagerness  to   dote and dwell upon it  to reckon it a brave or a fine thing  a   singular matter of commendation  a transcendent accomplishment    anywise preferable to rational endowments  or comparable to the   moral excellencies of our mind  to solid knowledge  or sound wisdom    or true virtue and goodness   this is extremely childish  or   brutish  and far below a man   what can be more absurd than to make   business of play  to be studious and laborious in toys  to make a   profession or drive a trade of impertinency   what more plain   nonsense can there be  than to be earnest in jest  to be continual   in divertisement  or constant in pastime  to make extravagance all   our way  and sauce all our diet   is not this plainly the life of a   child that is ever busy  yet never hath anything to do   or the life   of that mimical brute which is always active in playing uncouth and   unlucky tricks  which  could it speak  might surely pass well for a   professed wit     the proper work of man  the grand drift of human life  is to follow   reason  that noble spark kindled from heaven  that princely and   powerful faculty  which is able to reach so lofty objects  and   achieve so mighty works   not to soothe fancy  that brutish  shallow   and giddy power  able to perform nothing worthy much regard   we are   not  even cicero could tell us  born for play and jesting  but for   severity  and the study of graver and greater affairs   yes  we were   purposely designed  and fitly framed  to understand and contemplate    to affect and delight in  to undertake and pursue most noble and   worthy things  to be employed in business considerably profitable to   ourselves  and beneficial to others   we do therefore strangely   debase ourselves  when we do strongly bend our minds to  or set our   affections upon  such toys     especially to do so is unworthy of a christian  that is  of a person   who is advanced to so high a rank  and so glorious relations  who   hath so excellent objects of his mind and affections presented   before him  and so excellent rewards for his care and pains proposed   to him  who is engaged in affairs of so worthy nature  and so   immense consequence   for him to be zealous about quibbles  for him   to be ravished with puny conceits and expressions   tis a wondrous   oversight  and an enormous indecency     he indeed that prefers any faculty to reason  disclaims the   privilege of being a man  and understands not the worth of his own   nature  he that prizes any quality beyond virtue and goodness    renounces the title of a christian  and knows not how to value the   dignity of his profession   it is these two  reason and virtue  in   conjunction which produce all that is considerably good and great in   the world   fancy can do little  doth never anything well  except as   directed and wielded by them   do pretty conceits or humorous talk   carry on any business  or perform any work   no  they are   ineffectual and fruitless   often they disturb  but they never   despatch anything with good success   it is simple reason  as dull   and dry as it seemeth  which expediteth all the grand affairs  which   accomplisheth all the mighty works that we see done in the world     in truth  therefore  as one diamond is worth numberless bits of   glass  so one solid reason is worth innumerable fancies   one grain   of true science and sound wisdom in real worth and use doth outweigh   loads  if any loads can be  of freakish wit   to rate things   otherwise doth argue great weakness of judgment  and fondness of   mind   so to conceit of this way signifieth a weak mind  and much to   delight therein rendereth it so  nothing more debaseth the spirit of   a man  or more rendereth it light and trifling     hence if we must be venting pleasant conceits  we should do it as if   we did it not  carelessly and unconcernedly  not standing upon it    or valuing ourselves for it   we should do it with measure and   moderation  not giving up ourselves thereto  so as to mind it or   delight in it more than in any other thing   we should not be so   intent upon it as to become remiss in affairs more proper or needful   for us  so as to nauseate serious business  or disrelish the more   worthy entertainments of our minds   this is the great danger of it    which we daily see men to incur  they are so bewitched with a humour   of being witty themselves  or of hearkening to the fancies of   others  that it is this only which they can like or favour  which   they can endure to think or talk of    tis a great pity that men who   would seem to have so much wit  should so little understand   themselves   but further          vainglorious ostentation this way is very blamable   all   ambition  all vanity  all conceitedness  upon whatever ground they   are founded  are absolutely unreasonable and silly  but yet those   being grounded on some real ability  or some useful skill  are wise   and manly in comparison to this  which standeth on a foundation so   manifestly slight and weak   the old philosophers by a severe father   were called animalia gloriae  animals of glory   and by a satirical   poet they were termed bladders of vanity  but they at least did   catch at praise from praiseworthy knowledge  they were puffed up   with a wind which blew some good to mankind  they sought glory from   that which deserved glory if they had not sought it  it was a   substantial and solid credit which they did affect  resulting from   successful enterprises of strong reason  and stout industry   but   these animalculae gloriae  these flies  these insects of glory    these  not bladders  but bubbles of vanity  would be admired and   praised for that which is nowise admirable or laudable  for the   casual hits and emergencies of roving fancy  for stumbling on an odd   conceit or phrase  which signifieth nothing  and is as superficial   as the smile  as hollow as the noise it causeth   nothing certainly   in nature is more ridiculous than a self conceited wit  who deemeth   himself somebody  and greatly pretendeth to commendation from so   pitiful and worthless a thing as a knack of trifling         lastly  it is our duty never so far to engage ourselves in this   way as thereby to lose or to impair that habitual seriousness    modesty and sobriety of mind  that steady composedness  gravity and   constancy of demeanour  which become christians   we should   continually keep our minds intent upon our high calling  and grand   interests  ever well tuned  and ready for the performance of holy   devotions  and the practice of most serious duties with earnest   attention and fervent affection   wherefore we should never suffer   them to be dissolved into levity  or disordered into a wanton frame    indisposing us for religious thoughts and actions   we ought always   in our behaviour to maintain  not only  greek   a fitting decency     but also  greek   a stately gravity   a kind of venerable majesty    suitable to that high rank which we bear of god s friends and   children  adorning our holy profession  and guarding us from all   impressions of sinful vanity   wherefore we should not let ourselves   be transported into any excessive pitch of lightness  inconsistent   with or prejudicial to our christian state and business   gravity   and modesty are the senses of piety  which being once slighted  sin   will easily attempt and encroach upon us   so the old spanish   gentleman may be interpreted to have been wise who  when his son   upon a voyage to the indies took his leave of him  gave him this odd   advice   my son  in the first place keep thy gravity  in the next   place fear god   intimating that a man must first be serious  before   he can be pious     to conclude  as we need not be demure  so must we not be impudent    as we should not be sour  so ought we not to be fond  as we may be   free  so we should not be vain  as we may well stoop to friendly   complaisance  so we should take heed of falling into contemptible   levity   if without wronging others  or derogating from ourselves    we can be facetious  if we can use our wits in jesting innocently    and conveniently  we may sometimes do it   but let us  in compliance   with st  paul s direction  beware of  foolish talking and jesting   which are not convenient       now the god of grace and peace         make us perfect in every   good work to do his will  working in us that which is well pleasing   in his sight  through jesus christ  to whom be glory for ever and   ever   amen          against rash and vain swearing          but above all things  my brethren  swear not                                   st  james v         among other precepts of good life  directing the practice of virtue   and abstinence from sin  st  james doth insert this about swearing    couched in expression denoting his great earnestness  and apt to   excite our special attention   therein he doth not mean universally   to interdict the use of oaths  for that in some cases is not only   lawful  but very expedient  yea  needful  and required from us as a   duty  but that swearing which our lord had expressly prohibited to   his disciples  and which thence  questionless  the brethren to whom   st  james did write did well understand themselves obliged to   forbear  having learned so in the first catechisms of christian   institution  that is  needless and heedless swearing in ordinary   conversation  a practice then frequent in the world  both among jews   and gentiles  the which also  to the shame of our age  is now so   much in fashion  and with some men in vogue  the invoking god s   name  appealing to his testimony  and provoking his judgment upon   any slight occasion  in common talk  with vain incogitancy  or   profane boldness   from such practice the holy apostle exhorteth in   terms importing his great concernedness  and implying the matter to   be of highest importance  for   greek   saith he    before all   things   my brethren  do not swear   as if he did apprehend this sin   of all others to be one of the most heinous and pernicious   could   he have said more  would he have said so much  if he had not   conceived the matter to be of exceeding weight and consequence   and   that it is so  i mean now  by god s help  to show you  by proposing   some considerations  whereby the heinous wickedness  together with   the monstrous folly  of such rash and vain swearing will appear  the   which being laid to heart will  i hope  effectually dissuade and   deter from it       i   let us consider the nature of an oath  and what we do when we   adventure to swear     it is  as it is phrased in the decalogue  and elsewhere in holy   scripture  an assuming the name of god  and applying it to our   purpose  to countenance and confirm what we say     it is an invocation of god as a most faithful witness  concerning   the truth of our words  or the sincerity of our meaning     it is an appeal to god as a most upright judge whether we do   prevaricate in asserting what we do not believe true  or in   promising what we are not firmly resolved to perform     it is a formal engagement of god to be the avenger of our   trespassing in violation of truth or faith     it is a binding our souls with a most strict and solemn obligation    to answer before god  and to undergo the issue of his judgment about   what we affirm or undertake     such an oath is represented to us in holy scripture     whence we may collect  that swearing doth require great modesty and   composedness of spirit  very serious consideration and solicitous   care  that we be not rude and saucy with god  in taking up his name    and prostituting it to vile or mean uses  that we do not abuse or   debase his authority  by citing it to aver falsehoods or   impertinences  that we do not slight his venerable justice  by   rashly provoking it against us  that we do not precipitately throw   our souls into most dangerous snares and intricacies     for let us reflect and consider   what a presumption is it without   due regard and reverence to lay hold on god s name  with unhallowed   breath to vent and toss that great and glorious  that most holy    that reverend  that fearful and terrible name of the lord our god    the great creator  the mighty sovereign  the dreadful judge of all   the world  that name which all heaven with profoundest submission   doth adore  which the angelical powers  the brightest and purest   seraphim  without hiding their faces  and reverential horror  cannot   utter or hear  the very thought whereof should strike awe through   our hearts  the mention whereof would make any sober man to tremble      greek    for how   saith st  chrysostom   is it not absurd that a   servant should not dare to call his master by name  or bluntly and   ordinarily to mention him  yet that we slightly and contemptuously   should in our mouth toss about the lord of angels      how is it not absurd  if we have a garment better than the rest    that we forbear to use it continually  but in the most slight and   common way do wear the name of god      how grievous indecency is it  at every turn to summon our maker  and   call down almighty god from heaven  to attend our leisure  to vouch   our idle prattle  to second our giddy passions  to concern his   truth  his justice  his power in our trivial affairs     what a wildness is it  to dally with that judgment upon which the   eternal doom of all creatures dependeth  at which the pillars of   heaven are astonished  which hurled down legions of angels from the   top of heaven and happiness into the bottomless dungeon   the which    as grievous sinners  of all things we have most reason to dread  and   about which no sober man can otherwise think than did that great   king  the holy psalmist  who said   my flesh trembleth for thee  and   i am afraid of thy judgments      how prodigious a madness is it  without any constraint or needful   cause  to incur so horrible a danger  to rush upon a curse  to defy   that vengeance  the least touch of breath whereof can dash us to   nothing  or thrust us down into extreme and endless woe     who can express the wretchedness of that folly  which so entangleth   us with inextricable knots  and enchaineth our souls so rashly with   desperate obligations     wherefore he that would but a little mind what he doeth when he   dareth to swear  what it is to meddle with the adorable name  the   venerable testimony  the formidable judgment  the terrible vengeance   of the divine majesty  into what a case he putteth himself  how   extreme hazard he runneth thereby  would assuredly have little heart   to swear  without greatest reason  and most urgent need  hardly   without trembling would he undertake the most necessary and solemn   oath  much cause would he see  greek   to adore  to fear an oath     which to do  the divine preacher maketh the character of a good man      as   saith he   is the good  so is the sinner  and he that   sweareth  as he that feareth an oath      in fine  even a heathen philosopher  considering the nature of an   oath  did conclude the unlawfulness thereof in such cases   for     seeing   saith he   an oath doth call god for witness  and   proposeth him for umpire and voucher of the things it saith    therefore to induce god so upon occasion of human affairs  or  which   is all one  upon small and slight accounts  doth imply contempt of   him   wherefore we ought wholly to shun swearing  except upon   occasions of highest necessity        ii   we may consider that swearing  agreeably to its nature  or   natural aptitude and tendency  is represented in holy scripture as a   special part of religious worship  or devotion towards god  in the   due performance whereof we do avow him for the true god and governor   of the world  we piously do acknowledge his principal attributes and   special prerogatives  his omnipresence and omniscience  extending   itself to our most inward thoughts  our secretest purposes  our   closest retirements  his watchful providence over all our actions    affairs  and concerns  his faithful goodness  in favouring truth and   protecting right  his exact justice  in patronising sincerity  and   chastising perfidiousness  his being supreme lord over all persons    and judge paramount in all causes  his readiness in our need  upon   our humble imploration and reference  to undertake the arbitration   of matters controverted  and the care of administering justice  for   the maintenance of truth and right  of loyalty and fidelity  of   order and peace among men   swearing does also intimate a pious   truth and confidence in god  as aristotle observeth     such things a serious oath doth imply  to such purposes swearing   naturally serveth  and therefore to signify or effectuate them    divine institution hath devoted it     god in goodness to such ends hath pleased to lend us his great name    allowing us to cite him for a witness  to have recourse to his bar    to engage his justice and power  whenever the case deserveth and   requireth it  or when we cannot by other means well assure the   sincerity of our meaning  or secure the constancy of our   resolutions     yea  in such exigencies he doth exact this practice from us  as an   instance of our religious confidence in him  and as a service   conducible to his glory   for it is a precept in his law  of moral   nature  and eternal obligation   thou shalt fear the lord thy god    him shalt thou serve  and to him shalt thou cleave  and shalt swear   by his name    it is the character of a religious man to swear with   due reverence and upright conscience   for   the king   saith the   psalmist   shall rejoice in god  every one that sweareth by him   shall glory   but the mouth of them that speak lies shall be   stopped    it is a distinctive mark of god s people  according to   that of the prophet jeremy   and it shall come to pass  if they will   diligently learn the ways of my people  to swear by my name         then shall they be built in the midst of my people    it is   predicted concerning the evangelical times   unto me every knee   shall bow  every tongue shall swear   and   that he who blesseth   himself in the earth  shall bless himself by the god of truth  and   he that sweareth in the earth  shall swear by the god of truth      as therefore all other acts of devotion  wherein immediate   application is made to the divine majesty  should never be performed   without most hearty intention  most serious consideration  most   lowly reverence  so neither should this grand one  wherein god is so   nearly touched  and his chief attributes so much concerned   the   which indeed doth involve both prayer and praise  doth require the   most devotional acts of faith and fear     we therefore should so perform it as not to incur that reproof      this people draweth nigh unto me with their mouth  and honoureth me   with their lips  but their heart is far from me      when we seem most formally to avow god  to confess his omniscience    to confide in his justice  we should not really disregard him  and   in effect signify that we do not think he doth know what we say  or   what we do     if we do presume to offer this service  we should do it in the   manner appointed by himself  according to the conditions prescribed   in the prophet   thou shalt swear  the lord liveth  in truth  in   judgment  and in righteousness   in truth  taking heed that our   meaning be conformable to the sense of our words  and our words to   the verity of things  in judgment  having with careful deliberation   examined and weighed that which we assert or promise  in   righteousness  being satisfied in conscience that we do not therein   infringe any rule of piety toward god  of equity toward men  or   sobriety and discretion in regard to ourselves     the cause of our swearing must be needful  or very expedient  the   design of it must be honest and useful to considerable purposes    tending to god s honour  our neighbour s benefit  our own welfare     the matter of it should be not only just and lawful  but worthy and   weighty  the manner ought to be grave and solemn  our mind being   framed to earnest attention  and endued with pious affections   suitable to the occasion     otherwise  if we do venture to swear  without due advice and care    without much respect and awe  upon any slight or vain  not to say   bad or unlawful  occasion  we then desecrate swearing  and are   guilty of profaning a most sacred ordinance   the doing so doth   imply base hypocrisy  or lewd mockery  or abominable wantonness and   folly  in bodily invading and vainly trifling with the most august   duties of religion   such swearing therefore is very dishonourable   and injurious to god  very prejudicial to religion  very repugnant   to piety       iii   we may consider that the swearing prohibited is very noxious   to human society     the great prop of society  which upholdeth the safety  peace  and   welfare thereof  in observing laws  dispensing justice  discharging   trusts  keeping contracts  and holding good correspondence mutually    is conscience  or a sense of duty toward god  obliging to perform   that which is right and equal  quickened by hope of rewards and fear   of punishments from him   secluding which principle  no worldly   confederation is strong enough to hold men fast  or can further   dispose many to do right  or observe faith  or hold peace  than   appetite or interest  or humour  things very slippery and uncertain    do sway them     that men should live honestly  quietly  and comfortably together  it   is needful that they should live under a sense of god s will  and in   awe of the divine power  hoping to please god  and fearing to offend   him  by their behaviour respectively     that justice should be administered between men  it is necessary   that testimonies of fact be alleged  and that witnesses should   apprehend themselves greatly obliged to discover the truth    according to their conscience  in dark and doubtful cases     that men should uprightly discharge offices serviceable to public   good  it doth behove that they be firmly engaged to perform the   trusts reposed in them     that in affairs of very considerable importance men should deal with   one another with satisfaction of mind  and mutual confidence  they   must receive competent assurances concerning the integrity    fidelity  and constancy each of other     that the safety of governors may be preserved  and the obedience due   to them maintained secure from attempts to which they are liable  by   the treachery  levity  perverseness  timorousness  ambition  all   such lusts and ill humours of men   it is expedient that men should   be tied with the strictest bands of allegiance     that controversies emergent about the interests of men should be   determined  and an end put to strife by peremptory and satisfactory   means  is plainly necessary for common quiet     wherefore for the public interest and benefit of human society it is   requisite that the highest obligations possible should be laid upon   the consciences of men     and such are those of oaths  engaging them to fidelity and constancy   in all such cases  out of regard to almighty god  as the infallible   patron of truth and right  the unavoidable chastiser of   perfidiousness and improbity     to such purposes  therefore  oaths have ever been applied  as the   most effectual instruments of working them  not only among the   followers of true and perfect religion  but even among all those who   had any glimmering notions concerning a divine power and providence    who have deemed an oath the fastest tie of conscience  and held the   violation of it for the most detestable impiety and iniquity   so   that what cicero saith of the romans  that  their ancestors had no   band to constrain faith more strait than an oath   is true of all   other nations  common reason not being able to devise any engagement   more obliging than it is  it being in the nature of things  greek     and  greek   the utmost assurance  the last resort of human faith    the surest pledge that any man can yield of his trustiness   hence   ever in transactions of highest moment this hath been used to bind   the faith of men     hereby nations have been wont to ratify leagues of peace and amity   between each other  which therefore the greeks call  greek       hereby princes have obliged their subjects to loyalty   and it hath   ever been the strongest argument to press that duty  which the   preacher useth   i counsel thee to keep the king s commandment  and   that in regard of the oath of god      hereby generals have engaged their soldiers to stick close to them   in bearing hardships and encountering dangers     hereby the nuptial league hath been confirmed  the solemnisation   whereof in temples before god is in effect a most sacred oath     hereon the decision of the greatest causes concerning the lives    estates  and reputations of men have depended  so that  as the   apostle saith   an oath for confirmation is to them an end of all   strife      indeed  such hath the need hereof been ever apprehended  that we may   observe  in cases of great importance  no other obligation hath been   admitted for sufficient to bind the fidelity and constancy of the   most credible persons  so that even the best men hardly could trust   the best men without it   for instance     when abimelech would assure to himself the friendship of abraham    although he knew him to be a very pious and righteous person  whose   word might be as well taken as any man s  yet  for entire   satisfaction  he thus spake to him    god is with thee in all that   thou doest   now therefore swear unto me here by god  that thou wilt   not deal falsely with me      abraham  though he did much confide in the honesty of his servant   eliezer  having entrusted him with all his estate  yet in the affair   concerning the marriage of his son he could not but thus oblige him      put   saith he   i pray thee  thy hand under my thigh  and i will   make thee swear by the lord  the god of heaven and the god of the   earth  that thou wilt not take a wife unto my son of the daughters   of the canaanites      laban had good experience of jacob s fidelity  yet that would not   satisfy  but   the lord   said he   watch between me and thee  when   we are absent one from another  if thou shalt afflict my daughters    or if thou shalt take other wives beside my daughters  no man is   with us  see  god is witness between thee and me   the god of   abraham  and the god of nahor  the god of their father  judge   betwixt us      so did jacob make joseph swear that he would bury him in canaan     and joseph caused the children of israel to swear that they would   translate his bones   so did jonathan cause his beloved friend david   to swear that he would show kindness to him and to his house for   ever   the prudence of which course the event showeth  the total   excision of jonathan s family being thereby prevented  for  the   king    tis said   spared mephibosheth the son of jonathan  because   of the lord s oath that was between them      these instances declare that there is no security which men can   yield comparable to that of an oath  the obligation whereof no man   wilfully can infringe without renouncing the fear of god and any   pretence to his favour     wherefore human society will be extremely wronged and damnified by   the dissolving or slackening these most sacred bands of conscience    and consequently by their common and careless use  which soon will   breed a contempt of them  and render them insignificant  either to   bind the swearers  or to ground a trust on their oaths     as by the rare and reverent use of oaths their dignity is upheld and   their obligation kept fast  so by the frequent and negligent   application of them  by the prostituting them to every mean and   toyish purpose  their respect will be quite lost  their strength   will be loosed  they will prove unserviceable to public use     if oaths generally become cheap and vile  what will that of   allegiance signify   if men are wont to play with swearing anywhere    can we expect they should be serious and strict therein at the bar   or in the church   will they regard god s testimony  or dread his   judgment  in one place  or at one time  when everywhere upon any    upon no occasion they dare to confront and contemn them   who then   will be the more trusted for swearing   what satisfaction will any   man have from it   the rifeness of this practice  as it is the sign    so it will be the cause of a general diffidence among man     incredible therefore is the mischief which this vain practice will   bring in to the public  depriving princes of their best security    exposing the estates of private men to uncertainty  shaking all the   confidence men can have in the faith of one another     for which detriments accruing from this abuse to the public every   vain swearer is responsible  and he would do well to consider that   he will never be able to make reparation for them   and the public   is much concerned that this enormity be retrenched       iv   let us consider  that rash and vain swearing is very apt often   to bring the practiser of it into that most horrible sin of perjury     for  false swearing   as the hebrew wise man saith   naturally   springeth out of much swearing   and   he   saith st  chrysostom     that sweareth continually  both willingly and unwillingly  both   ignorantly and knowingly  both in earnest and in sport  being often   transported by anger and many other things  will frequently   forswear   it is confessed and manifest  that it is necessary for   him that sweareth much to be perjurious     greek    for   saith he   again   it is impossible  it is impossible for a mouth addicted to   swearing not frequently to forswear    he that sweareth at random    as blind passion moveth  or wanton fancy prompteth  or the temper   suggesteth  often will hit upon asserting that which is false  or   promising that which is impossible   that want of conscience and of   consideration which do suffer him to violate god s law in swearing   will betray him to the venting of lies  which backed with oaths   become perjuries   if sometime what he sweareth doth happen to be   true and performable  it doth not free him of guilt  it being his   fortune  rather than his care or conscience  which keepeth him from   perjury       v   such swearing commonly will induce a man to bind himself by oath   to unlawful practices  and consequently will entangle him in a   woeful necessity either of breaking his oath  or of doing worse  and   committing wickedness   so that  swearing   as st  chrysostom saith     hath this misery attending it  that  both trangressed and observed    it plagueth those who are guilty of it      of this perplexity the holy scripture affordeth two notable   instances   the one of saul  forced to break his rash oaths  the   other of herod  being engaged thereby to commit a most horrid   murder     had saul observed his oaths  what injury had he done  what mischief   had he produced  in slaughtering his most worthy and most innocent   son  the prop and glory of his family  the bulwark of his country    and the grand instrument of salvation to it  in forcing the people   to violate their cross oath  and for prevention of one  causing many   perjuries   he was therefore fain to desist  and lie under the guilt   of breaking his oaths     and for herod  the excellent father thus presseth the consideration   of his case    take   saith he   i beseech you  the chopped off head   of st  john  and his warm blood yet trickling down  each of you bear   it home with you  and conceive that before your eyes you hear it   uttering speech  and saying  embrace the murderer of me  an oath     that which reproof did not  this an oath did do  that which the   tyrant s wrath could not  this the necessity of keeping an oath did   effect   for when the tyrant was reprehended publicly in the   audience of all men  he bravely did bear the rebuke  but when he had   cast himself into the necessity of oaths  then did he cut off that   blessed head        vi   likewise the use of rash swearing will often engage a man in   undertakings very inconvenient and detrimental to himself   a man is   bound to perform his vows to the lord  whatever they be  whatever   damage or trouble thence may accrue to him  if they be not unlawful     it is the law  that which is gone out of thy lips  thou shalt keep   and perform   it is the property of a good man  that he sweareth to   his own hurt  and changeth not   wherefore  tis the part of a sober   man to be well advised what he doth swear or vow religiously  that   he do not put himself into the inextricable strait of committing   great sin  or undergoing great inconvenience  that he do not rush   into that snare of which the wise man speaketh   it is a snare to a   man to devour that which is holy  or  to swallow a sacred   obligation   and after vows to make inquiry   seeking how he may   disengage himself the doing which is a folly offensive to god  as   the preacher telleth us    when   saith he   thou vowest a vow unto   god  defer not to pay it  for he hath no pleasure in fools   pay   that which thou hast vowed    god will not admit our folly in vowing   as a plea for non performance  he will exact it from us both as a   due debt  and as a proper punishment of our impious folly     for instance  into what loss and mischief  what sorrow  what regret   and repentance  did the unadvised vow of jephthah throw him  the   performance whereof  as st  chrysostom remarketh  god did permit    and order to be commemorated with solemn lamentation  that all   posterity might be admonished thereby  and deterred from such   precipitant swearing       vii   let us consider that swearing is a sin of all others   peculiarly clamorous  and provocative of divine judgment   god is   hardly so much concerned  or in a manner constrained  to punish any   other sin as this   he is bound in honour and interest to vindicate   his name from the abuse  his authority from the contempt  his holy   ordinance from the profanation  which it doth infer   he is   concerned to take care that his providence be not questioned  that   the dread of his majesty be not voided  that all religion be not   overthrown by the outrageous commission thereof with impunity     it immediately toucheth his name  it expressly calleth upon him to   mind it  to judge it  to show himself in avenging it   he may seem   deaf  or unconcerned  if  being so called and provoked  he doth not   declare himself     there is understood to be a kind of formal compact between him and   mankind  obliging him to interpose  to take the matter into his   cognisance  being specially addressed to him     the bold swearer doth importune him to hear  doth rouse him to mark    doth brave him to judge and punish his wickedness     hence no wonder that  the flying roll   a quick and inevitable   curse  doth surprise the swearer  and cut him off  as it is in the   prophet   no wonder that so many remarkable instances do occur in   history of signal vengeance inflicted on persons notably guilty of   this crime   no wonder that a common practice thereof doth fetch   down public judgments  and that  as the prophets of old did   proclaim   because of swearing the land mourneth        viii   further  passing over the special laws against it  the   mischievous consequences of it  the sore punishments appointed to   it   we may consider  that to common sense vain swearing is a very   unreasonable and ill favoured practice  greatly misbecoming any   sober  worthy  or honest person  but especially most absurd and   incongruous to a christian     for in ordinary conversation what needful or reasonable occasion can   intervene of violating this command   if there come under discourse   a matter of reason  which is evidently true and certain  then what   need can there be of an oath to affirm it  it sufficing to expose it   to light  or to propose the evidences for it   if an obscure or   doubtful point come to be debated  it will not bear an oath  it will   be a strange madness to dare  a great folly to hope the persuading   it thereby   what were more ridiculous than to swear the truth of a   demonstrable theorem   what more vain than so to assert a disputable   problem   oaths  like wagers  are in such cases no arguments  except   silliness in the users of them     if a matter of history be started  then if a man be taken for   honest  his word will pass for attestation without further   assurance  but if his veracity or probity be doubted  his oath will   not be relied on  especially when he doth obtrude it   for it was no   less truly than acutely said by the old poet   greek    the man doth   not get credit from an oath  but an oath from the man    and a   greater author   an oath   saith st  chrysostom   doth not make a   man credible  but the testimony of his life  and the exactness of   his conversation  and a good repute   many often have burst with   swearing  and persuaded no man  others only nodding have deserved   more belief than those who swore so mightily    wherefore oaths  as   they are frivolous coming from a person of little worth or   conscience  so they are superfluous in the mouth of an honest and   worthy person  yea  as they do not increase the credit of the   former  so they may impair that of the latter      a good man   as socrates did say   should apparently so demean   himself  that his word may be deemed more credible than an oath     the constant tenour of his practice vouching for it  and giving it   such weight  that no asseveration can further corroborate it     he should  greek    swear by his good deeds   and exhibit  greek      a life deserving belief   as clemens alex  saith   so that no man   should desire more from him than his bare assertion  but willingly   should yield him the privilege which the athenians granted to   xenocrates  that he should testify without swearing     he should be like the essenes  of whom josephus saith  that   everything spoken by them was more valid than an oath  whence they   declined swearing     he should so much confide in his own veracity and fidelity  and so   much stand upon them  that he should not deign to offer any pledge   for them  implying them to want confirmation      he should   as st  jerome saith   so love truth  that he should   suppose himself to have sworn whatsoever he hath said   and   therefore should not be apt to heap another oath on his words     upon such accounts common reason directed even pagan wise men wholly   to interdict swearing in ordinary conversation  or about petty   matters  as an irrational and immoral practice  unworthy of sober   and discreet persons    forbear swearing about any matter   said   plato  cited by clem  alex    avoid swearing  if you can  wholly     said epictetus    for money swear by no god  though you swear   truly   said socrates   and divers the like precepts occur in other   heathens  the mention whereof may well serve to strike shame into   many loose and vain people bearing the name of christians     indeed  for a true and real christian  this practice doth especially   in a far higher degree misbecome him  upon considerations peculiar   to his high calling and holy profession     plutarch telleth us that among the romans the flamen of jupiter was   not permitted to swear  of which law among other reasons he assigned   this    because it is not handsome that he to whom divine and   greatest things are entrusted should be distrusted about small   matters    the which reason may well be applied to excuse every   christian from it  who is a priest to the most high god  and hath   the most celestial and important matters concredited to him  in   comparison to which all other matters are very mean and   inconsiderable   the dignity of his rank should render his word   verbum honoris  passable without any further engagement   he hath   opinions of things  he hath undertaken practices inconsistent with   swearing   for he that firmly doth believe that god is ever present   with him  and auditor and witness of all his discourse  he that is   persuaded that a severe judgment shall pass on him  wherein he must   give an account for every idle word which slippeth from him  and   wherein  among other offenders  assuredly liars will be condemned to   the burning lake  he that in a great sacrament  once most solemnly   taken  and frequently renewed  hath engaged and sworn  together with   all other divine commandments  to observe those which most expressly   do charge him to be exactly just  faithful  and veracious in all his   words and deeds  who therefore should be ready to say with david   i   have sworn  and am steadfastly purposed to keep thy righteous   judgments   to him every word hath the force of an oath  every lie    every breach of promise  every violation of faith doth involve   perjury   for him to swear is false heraldry  an impertinent   accumulation of one oath upon another  he of all men should disdain   to allow that his words are not perfectly credible  that his promise   is not secure  without being assured by an oath       ix   indeed  the practice of swearing greatly disparageth him that   useth it  and derogateth from his credit upon divers accounts     it signifieth  if it signifieth anything  that he doth not confide   in his own reputation  and judgeth his own bare word not to deserve   credit   for why  if he taketh his word to be good  doth he back it   with asseverations  why  if he deemeth his own honesty to bear   proof  doth he cite heaven to warrant it      it is   saith st  basil   a very foul and silly thing for a man to   accuse himself as unworthy of belief  and to proffer an oath for   security      by so doing a man doth authorise others to distrust him  for it can   be no wrong to distrust him who doth not pretend to be a credible   person  or that his saying alone may safely be taken   who  by   suspecting that others are not satisfied with his simple assertion    implieth a reason known to himself for it     it rendereth whatever he saith to be in reason suspicious  as   discovering him void of conscience and discretion  for he that   flatly against the rules of duty and reason will swear vainly  what   can engage him to speak truly   he that is so loose in so clear and   so considerable a point of obedience to god  how can he be supposed   staunch in regard to any other    it being   as aristotle hath it     the part of the same men to do ill things  and not to regard   forswearing    it will at least constrain any man to suspect all his   discourse of vanity and unadvisedness  seeing he plainly hath no   care to bridle his tongue from so gross an offence     it is strange  therefore  that any man of honour or honesty should   not scorn  by such a practice  to shake his own credit  or to   detract from the validity of his word  which should stand firm on   itself  and not want any attestation to support it   it is a   privilege of honourable persons that they are excused from swearing    and that their verbum honoris passeth in lieu of an oath   is it not   then strange  that when others dispense with them  they should not   dispense with themselves  but voluntarily degrade themselves  and   with sin forfeit so noble a privilege       x   to excuse these faults  the swearer will be forced to confess   that his oaths are no more than waste and insignificant words    deprecating being taken for serious  or to be understood that he   meaneth anything by them  but only that he useth them as expletive   phrases   greek   to plump his speech  and fill up sentences   but   such pleas do no more than suggest other faults of swearing  and   good arguments against it  its impertinence  its abuse of speech    its disgracing the practiser of it in point of judgment and   capacity   for so it is  oaths as they commonly pass are mere   excrescences of speech  which do nothing but encumber and deform it    they so embellish discourse  as a wen or a scab do beautify a face    as a patch or a spot do adorn a garment     to what purpose  i pray  is god s name hooked and haled into our   idle talk  why should we so often mention him  when we do not mean   anything about him  would it not  into every sentence to foist a dog   or a horse  to intrude turkish  or any barbarous gibberish  be   altogether as proper and pertinent     what do these superfluities signify  but that the venter of them   doth little skill the use of speech  or the rule of conversation    but meaneth to sputter and prate anything without judgment or wit    that his invention is very barren  his fancy beggarly  craving the   aid of any stuff to relieve it   one would think a man of sense   should grudge to lend his ear  or incline his attention to such   motley ragged discourse  that without nauseating he scarce should   endure to observe men lavishing time  and squandering their breath   so frivolously    tis an affront to good company to pester it with   such talk       xi   but further  upon higher accounts this is a very uncivil and   unmannerly practice     some vain persons take it for a genteel and graceful thing  a   special accomplishment  a mark of fine breeding  a point of high   gallantry  for who  forsooth  is the brave spark  the complete   gentleman  the man of conversation and address  but he that hath the   skill and confidence  o heavens  how mean a skill  how mad a   confidence   to lard every sentence with an oath or a curse  making   bold at every turn to salute his maker  or to summon him in   attestation of his tattle  not to say calling and challenging the   almighty to damn and destroy him   such a conceit  i say  too many   have of swearing  because a custom thereof  together with divers   other fond and base qualities  hath prevailed among some people    bearing the name and garb of gentlemen     but in truth  there is no practice more crossing the genuine nature   of genteelness  or misbecoming persons well born and well bred  who   should excel the rude vulgar in goodness  in courtesy  in nobleness   of heart  in unwillingness to offend  and readiness to oblige those   with whom they converse  in steady composedness of mind and manners    in disdaining to say or do any unworthy  any unhandsome things     for this practice is not only a gross rudeness toward the main body   of men  who justly reverence the name of god  and detest such an   abuse thereof  not only further an insolent defiance of the common   profession  the religion  the law of our country  which disalloweth   and condemneth it  but it is very odious and offensive to any   particular society or company  at least  wherein there is any sober   person  any who retaineth a sense of goodness  or is anywise   concerned for god s honour   for to any such person no language can   be more disgustful  nothing can more grate his ears  or fret his   heart  than to hear the sovereign object of his love and esteem so   mocked and slighted  to see the law of his prince so disloyally   infringed  so contemptuously trampled on  to find his best friend   and benefactor so outrageously abused   to give him the lie were a   compliment  to spit in his face were an obligation  in comparison to   this usage     wherefore  tis a wonder that any person of rank  any that hath in   him a spark of ingenuity  or doth at all pretend to good manners    should find in his heart or deign to comply with so scurvy a   fashion   a fashion much more befitting the scum of the people than   the flower of the gentry  yea  rather much below any man endued with   a scrap of reason or a grain of goodness   would we bethink   ourselves  modest  sober  and pertinent discourse would appear far   more generous and masculine than such mad hectoring the almighty    such boisterous insulting over the received laws and general notions   of mankind  such ruffianly swaggering against sobriety and goodness     if gentlemen would regard the virtues of their ancestors  the   founders of their quality  that gallant courage and solid wisdom    that noble courtesy  which advanced their families and severed them   from the vulgar  this degenerate wantonness and forbidness of   language would return to the dunghill  or rather  which god grant    be quite banished from the world  the vulgar following their   example       xii   further  the words of our lord  when he forbade this practice    do suggest another consideration against it  deducible from the   causes and sources of it  from whence it cometh  that men are so   inclined or addicted thereto    let   saith he   your communication   be yea  yea  nay  nay  for whatsoever is more than these cometh of   evil    the roots of it  he assureth us  are evil  and therefore the   fruit cannot be good   it is no grape which groweth from thorns  or   fig from thistles   consult experience  and observe whence it doth   proceed     sometimes it ariseth from exorbitant heats of spirit  or transports   of unbridled passion   when a man is keenly peevish  or fiercely   angry  or eagerly contentious  then he blustereth  and dischargeth   his choler in most tragical strains  then he would fright the   objects of his displeasure by the most violent expressions thereof     this is sometime alleged in excuse of rash swearing   i was   provoked  the swearer will say  i was in passion  but it is strange   that a bad cause should justify a bad effect  that one crime should   warrant another  that what would spoil a good action should excuse a   bad one     sometimes it proceedeth from arrogant conceit  and a tyrannical   humour  when a man fondly admireth his own opinion  and affecting to   impose it on others  is thence moved to thwack it on with lusty   asseverations     sometimes it issueth from wantonness and levity of mind  disposing a   man to sport with anything  how serious  how grave  how sacred and   venerable soever     sometimes its rise is from stupid inadvertency  or heady   precipitancy  when the man doth not heed what he saith  or consider   the nature and consequence of his words  but snatcheth any   expression which cometh next  or which his roving fancy doth offer    for want of that caution of the psalmist   i said  i will take heed   to my ways  that i sin not with my tongue  i will keep my mouth with   a bridle  while the wicked is before me      sometimes  alas  how often in this miserable age   it doth spring   from profane boldness  when men design to put affronts on religion    and to display their scorn and spite against conscience  affecting   the reputation of stout blades  of gallant hectors  of resolute   giants  who dare do anything  who are not afraid to defy heaven  and   brave god almighty himself     sometimes it is derived from apish imitation  or a humour to comply   with a fashion current among vain and dissolute persons     it always doth come from a great defect in conscience  of reverence   to god  of love to goodness  of discretion and sober regard to the   welfare of a man s soul     from such evidently vicious and unworthy sources it proceedeth  and   therefore must needs be very culpable   no good  no wise man can   like actions drawn from such principles   further        xiii   this offence may be particularly aggravated by considering   that it hath no strong temptation alluring to it  that it yieldeth   no sensible advantage  that it most easily may be avoided or   corrected      every sin   saith st  chrysostom   hath not the same punishment    but those things which may easily be reformed do bring on us greater   punishment   and what can be more easy than to reform this fault      tell me   saith he   what difficulty  what sweat  what art  what   hazard  what more doth it require beside a little care  to abstain   wholly from it   it is but willing  or resolving on it  and it is   instantly done  for there is not any natural inclination disposing   to it  any strong appetite to detain us under its power     it gratifieth no sense  it yieldeth no profit  it procureth no   honour  for the sound of it is not very melodious  and no man surely   did ever get an estate by it  or was preferred to dignity for it     it rather to any good ear maketh a horrid and jarring noise  it   rather with the best part of the world produceth displeasure    damage  and disgrace   what therefore  beside monstrous vanity and   unaccountable perverseness  should hold men so devoted thereto     surely of all dealers in sin the swearer is palpably the silliest    and maketh the worst bargains for himself  for he sinneth gratis    and  like those in the prophet   selleth his soul for nothing    an   epicure hath some reason to allege  an extortioner is a man of   wisdom  and acteth prudently in comparison to him  for they enjoy   some pleasure  or acquire some gain here  in lieu of their salvation   hereafter  but this fondling offendeth heaven  and abandoneth   happiness  he knoweth not why or for what   he hath not so much as   the common plea of human infirmity to excuse him  he can hardly say   that he was tempted thereto by any bait     a fantastic humour possesseth him of spurning at piety and   soberness  he inconsiderately followeth a herd of wild fops  he   affecteth to play the ape   what more than this can he say for   himself       xiv   finally  let us consider that as we ourselves  with all our   members and powers  were chiefly designed and framed to glorify our   maker  the which to do is indeed the greatest perfection and noblest   privilege of our nature  so our tongue and speaking faculty were   given to us to declare our admiration and reverence of him  to   exhibit our due love and gratitude toward him  to profess our trust   and confidence in him  to celebrate his praises  to avow his   benefits  to address our supplications to him  to maintain all kinds   of devotional intercourse with him  to propagate our knowledge    fear  love  and obedience to him  in all such ways to promote his   honour and service   this is the most proper  worthy  and due use of   our tongue  for which it was created  to which it is dedicated  from   whence it becometh  as it is so often styled  our glory  and the   best member that we have  that whereby we excel all creatures here   below  and whereby we are no less discriminated from them  than by   our reason  that whereby we consort with the blessed angels above in   the distinct utterance of praise and communication of glory to our   creator   wherefore  applying this to any impious discourse with   which to profane god s blessed name  with this to violate his holy   commands  with this to unhallow his sacred ordinance  with this to   offer dishonour and indignity to him  is a most unnatural abuse  a   horrid ingratitude toward him     it is that indeed whereby we render this noble organ incapable of   any good use   for how  as the excellent father doth often urge  can   we pray to god for mercies  or praise god for his benefits  or   heartily confess our sins  or cheerfully partake of the holy   mysteries  with a mouth defiled by impious oaths  with a heart   guilty of so heinous disobedience     likewise  whereas a secondary very worthy use of our speech is to   promote the good of our neighbour  and especially to edify him in   piety  according to that wholesome precept of the apostle   let no   corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth  but that which is   good to the use of edifying  that it may administer grace unto the   hearers    the practice of swearing is an abuse very contrary to   that good purpose  serving to corrupt our neighbour  and to instil   into him a contempt of religion  or however grievously to scandalise   him       xv   i shall add but two words more   one is  that we would   seriously consider that our blessed saviour  who loved us so dearly    who did and suffered so much for us  who redeemed us by his blood    who said unto us   if ye love me  keep my commandments   he thus   positively hath enjoined   but i say unto you  swear not at all     and how then can we find in our heart directly to thwart his word     the other is  that we would lay to heart the reason whereby st    james doth enforce the point  and the sting in the close of our   text  wherewith i conclude    but above all things  my brethren    swear not  neither by heaven  neither by the earth  neither by any   other oath  but let your yea be yea  and your nay nay  lest ye fall   into condemnation   or   lest ye fall under damnation    from the   which infinite mischief  and from all sin that may cause it  god in   mercy deliver us through our blessed redeemer jesus  to whom for   ever be all glory and praise         of evil speaking in general          to speak evil of no man    titus iii        these words do imply a double duty  one incumbent on teachers    another on the people who are to be instructed by them     the teacher s duty appeareth from reflecting on the words of the   context  which govern these  and make them up an entire sentence     put them in mind  or  rub up their memory to do thus   it is st    paul s injunction to titus  a bishop and pastor of the church  that   he should admonish the people committed to his care and instruction    as of other great duties  of yielding obedience to magistrates  of   behaving themselves peaceably  of practising meekness and equity   towards all men  of being readily disposed to every good work   so   particularly of this   greek   to revile or speak evil of no man     whence it is apparent that this is one of the principal duties that   preachers are obliged to mind people of  and to press upon them     and if this were needful then  when charity  kindled by such   instructions and examples  was so lively  when christians  by their   sufferings  were so inured to meekness and patience  even every one    for the honour of his religion  and the safety of his person  was   concerned in all respects to demean himself innocently and   inoffensively  then is it now especially requisite  when  such   engagements and restraints being taken off  love being cooled    persecution being extinct  the tongue being set loose from all   extraordinary curbs  the transgression of this duty is grown so   prevalent and rife  that evil speaking is almost as common as   speaking  ordinary conversation extremely abounding therewith  that   ministers should discharge their office in dehorting and dissuading   from it     well indeed it were  if by their example of using mild and moderate   discourse  of abstaining from virulent invectives  tauntings  and   scoffings  good for little but to inflame anger  and infuse ill   will  they would lead men to good practice of this sort   for no   examples can be so wholesome  or so mischievous to this purpose  as   those which come down from the pulpit  the place of edification    backed with special authority and advantage     however  it is to preachers a ground of assurance and matter of   satisfaction  that in pressing this duty they shall perform their   duty   their text being not so much of their own choosing  as given   them by st  paul  they can surely scarce find a better to discourse   upon   it cannot be a matter of small moment or use  which this   great master and guide so expressly directeth us to insist upon     and to the observance of his precept  so far as concerneth me  i   shall immediately apply myself     it is then the duty of all christian people  to be taught and   pressed on them  not to reproach  or speak evil of any man   the   which duty  for your instruction  i shall first endeavour somewhat   to explain  declaring its import and extent  then  for your further   edification  i shall inculcate it  proposing several inducements   persuasive to the observance of it       i   for explication  we may first consider the object of it  no man    then the act itself  which is prohibited  to blaspheme  that is  to   reproach  to revile  or  as we have it rendered  to speak evil     no man   st  paul questionless did especially mean hereby to hinder   the christians at that time from reproaching the jews and the pagans   among whom they lived  men in their lives very wicked and corrupt    men in opinion extremely dissenting from them  men who greatly did   hate  and cruelly did persecute them  of whom therefore they had   mighty provocations and temptations to speak ill  their judgment of   the persons  and their resentment of injuries  making it difficult   to abstain from doing so   whence by a manifest analogy may be   inferred that the object of duty is very large  indeed universal and   unlimited   that we must forbear reproach not only against pious and   virtuous persons  against persons of our own judgment or party    against those who never did harm or offend us  against our   relations  our friends  our benefactors  in respect of whom there is   no ground or temptation of evil speaking  but even against the most   unworthy and wicked persons  against those who most differ in   opinion and practice from us  against those who never did oblige us    yea  those who have most disobliged us  even against our most bitter   and spiteful enemies   there is no exception or excuse to be   admitted from the quality  state  relation  or demeanour of men  the   duty  according to the proper sense  or due qualifications and   limits of the act  doth extend to all men   for   speak evil of no   man      as for the act  it may be inquired what the word  greek   to   blaspheme  doth import   i answer  that it is to vent words   concerning any person which do signify in us ill opinion  or   contempt  anger  hatred  enmity conceived in our minds towards him    which are apt in him to kindle wrath  and breed ill blood towards   us  which tend to beget in others that hear ill conceit or ill will   towards him  which are much destructive of his reputation    prejudicial to his interests  productive of damage or mischief to   him   it is otherwise in scripture termed  greek   to rail or   revile   to use bitter and ignominious language    greek   to speak   contumeliously   greek   to bring railing accusation  or reproachful   censure    greek   to use obloquy  or detraction   greek   to curse    that is  to speak words importing that we do wish ill to a person     such is the language we are prohibited to use   to which purpose we   may observe that whereas  in our conversation and commerce with men    there do frequently often occur occasions to speak of men and to men   words apparently disadvantageous to them  expressing our dissent in   opinion from them  or a dislike in us of their proceedings  we may   do this in different ways and terms  some of them gentle and   moderate  signifying no ill mind or disaffection towards them    others harsh and sharp  arguing height of disdain  disgust  or   despite  whereby we bid them defiance  and show that we mean to   exasperate them   thus  telling a man that we differ in judgment   from him  or conceive him not to be in the right  and calling him a   liar  a deceiver  a fool  saying that he doeth amiss  taketh a wrong   course  transgresseth the rule  and calling him dishonest  unjust    wicked  to omit more odious and provoking names  unbecoming this   place  and not deserving our notice  are several ways of expressing   the same things whereof the latter  in relating passages concerning   our neighbour  or in debating cases with him  is prohibited   for   thus the words reproaching  reviling  railing  cursing  and the like   do signify  and thus our lord himself doth explain them in his   divine sermon  wherein he doth enact this law    whosoever   saith   he   shall say to his brother  raca   that is  vain man  or liar      shall be in danger of the council  but whosoever shall say  thou   fool  shall be in danger of hell fire   that is  he rendereth   himself liable to a strict account  and to severe condemnation   before god  who useth contemptuous and contumelious expressions   towards his neighbour  in proportion to the malignity of such   expressions     the reason of things also doth help to explain those words  and to   show why they are prohibited because those harsh terms are needless    mild words serving as well to express the same things   because they   are commonly unjust  loading men with greater defect or blame than   they can be proved to deserve  or their actions do import  for every   man that speaketh falsehood is not therefore a liar  every man that   erreth is not thence a fool  every man that doeth amiss is not   consequently dishonest or wicked  the secret intentions and habitual   dispositions of men not being always to be collected from their   outward actions  because they are uncharitable  signifying that we   entertain the worst opinions of men  and make the worst construction   of their doings  and are disposed to show them no favour or   kindness   because  also  they produce mischievous effects  such as   spring from the worst passions raised by them     this in gross is the meaning of the precept   but since there are   some other precepts seeming to clash with this  since there are   cases wherein we are allowed to use the harsher sort of terms  there   are great examples in appearance thwarting this rule  therefore it   may be requisite for determining the limits of our duty  and   distinguishing it from transgression  that such exceptions or   restrictions should be somewhat declared         first  then  we may observe that it may be allowable to persons   in anywise concerned in the prosecution or administration of   justice  to speak words which in private intercourse would be   reproachful   a witness may impeach of crimes hurtful to justice  or   public tranquillity  a judge may challenge  may rebuke  may condemn   an offender in proper terms  or forms of speech prescribed by law     although most disgraceful and distasteful to the guilty   for it   belongeth to the majesty of public justice to be bold  blunt    severe  little regarding the concerns or passions of particular   persons  in comparison to the public welfare     a testimony  therefore  or sentence against a criminal  which   materially is a reproach  and morally would be such in a private   mouth  is not yet formally so according to the intent of this rule     for practices of this kind  which serve the exigencies of justice    are not to be interpreted as proceeding from anger  hatred  revenge    any bad passion or humour  but in way of needful discipline for   god s service  and common benefit of men   it is not  indeed  so   much the minister of justice  as god himself  our absolute lord  as   the sovereign  god s representative  acting in the public behalf  as   the commonwealth itself  who by his mouth do rebuke the obnoxious   person         god s ministers in religious affairs  to whom the care of men s   instruction and edification is committed  are enabled to inveigh   against sin and vice  whoever consequentially may be touched   thereby   yea  sometimes it is their duty with severity and   sharpness to reprove particular persons  not only privately  but   publicly  for their correction  and for the edification of others     thus st  paul directeth timothy    them that sin   notoriously and   scandalously  he meaneth    rebuke before all  that others may   fear   that is  in a manner apt to make impression on the minds of   the hearers  so as to scare them from like offences   and to titus   he writes   rebuke them sharply  that they may be found in the   faith    and   cry aloud  spare not  lift up thy voice like a   trumpet  and show my people their transgressions  and the house of   jacob their sins   saith the lord to the prophet   such are the   charges and commissions laid on and granted to his messengers     thus we may observe that god s prophets of old  st  john the   baptist  our lord himself  the holy apostles did in terms most   vehement and biting reprove the age in which they lived  and some   particular persons in them   the prophets are full of declamations   and invectives against the general corruption of their times  and   against the particular manners of some persons in them    ah  sinful   nation  people laden with iniquity  a seed of evil doers  children   that are corrupters   they are all adulterers  an assembly of   treacherous men  and they bend their tongues like their bow for   lies   thy princes are rebellious and companions of thieves  every   one loveth gifts  and followeth after rewards   they judge not the   fatherless  neither doth the cause of the widow come before them     the prophets prophesy falsely  and the priests rule by their means     as troops of robbers wait for a man  so the company of priests   murder in the way by consent  and commit lewdness    such is their   style commonly   st  john the baptist calleth the scribes and   pharisees a  generation of vipers    our saviour speaketh of them in   the same terms  calleth them an  evil and adulterous generation    serpents  and children of vipers   hypocrites  painted sepulchres    obscure graves   greek    blind guides  fools and blind  children of   the devil    st  paul likewise calleth the schismatical heretical   teachers  dogs  false apostles  evil and deceitful workers  men of   corrupt minds  reprobates and abominable    with the like colours do   st  peter  st  jude  and other apostles paint them   which sort of   speeches are to be supposed to proceed  not from private passion or   design  but out of holy zeal for god s honour  and from earnest   charity towards men  for to work their amendment and common   edification   they were uttered also by special wisdom and peculiar   order  from god s authority  and in his name  so that  as god by   them is said to preach  to entreat  to warn  and to exhort  so by   them also he may be said to reprehend and reproach         even private persons in due season  with discretion and temper    may reprove others  whom they observe to commit sin  or follow bad   courses  out of charitable design  and with hope to reclaim them     this was an office of charity imposed anciently even upon the jews    much more doth it lie upon christians  who are obliged more   earnestly to tender the spiritual good of those who by the stricter   and more holy bands of brotherhood are allied to them    thou shalt   not hate thy brother  thou shalt in any wise rebuke thy neighbour    and not suffer sin upon him   was a precept of the old law   and     greek   to admonish the disorderly  is an evangelical rule   such   persons we are enjoined to shun and decline  but first we must   endeavour by sober advice and admonition to reclaim them  we must   not thus reject them till they appear contumacious and incorrigible    refusing to hear us  or becoming deaf to reproof   this  although it   necessarily doth include setting out their faults  and charging   blame on them  answerable to their offences   is not the culpable   reproach here meant  it being needful towards a wholesome effect    and proceeding from charitable intention         some vehemency  some smartness and sharpness of speech may   sometimes be used in defence of truth  and impugning errors of bad   consequence  especially when it concerneth the interest of truth    that the reputation and authority of its adversaries should somewhat   be abased or abated   if by partial opinion or reverence towards   them  however begotten in the minds of men  they strive to overbear   or discountenance a good cause  their faults  so far as truth   permitteth and need requireth  may be detected and displayed   for   this cause particularly may we presume our lord  otherwise so meek   in his temper  and mild in his carriage towards all men  did   characterise the jewish scribes in such terms  that their authority    being then so prevalent with the people  might not prejudice the   truth  and hinder the efficacy of his doctrine   this is part of   that  greek   that duty of contending earnestly for the faith  which   is incumbent on us         it may be excusable upon particular emergent occasions  with   some heat of language to express dislike of notorious wickedness     as our lord doth against the perverse incredulity and stupidity in   the pharisees  their profane misconstruction of his words and   actions  their malicious opposing truth  and obstructing his   endeavours in god s service   as st  peter did to simon magus    telling him that he was in the gall of bitterness  and in the bond   of iniquity   as st  paul to elymas the sorcerer  when he withstood   him  and desired to turn away the deputy sergius from the faith     o   said he  stirred with a holy zeal and indignation   thou full   of all subtilty and all mischief  thou child of the devil  thou   enemy of all righteousness  wilt thou not cease to pervert the right   ways of the lord    the same spirit which enabled him to inflict a   sore punishment on that wicked wretch  did prompt him to use that   sharp language towards him  unquestionably deserved  and seasonably   pronounced   as also when the high priest commanded him illegally   and unjustly to be misused  that speech from a mind justly sensible   of such outrage broke forth   god shall smite thee  thou whited   wall    so when st  peter presumptuously would have dissuaded our   lord from compliance with god s will  in undergoing those crosses   which were appointed to him by god s decree  our lord calleth him   satan            greek    avaunt  satan  thou art an offence unto   me  for thou savourest not the things that be of god  but those that   are of men      these sort of speeches  issuing from just and honest indignation    are sometimes excusable  oftentimes commendable  especially when   they come from persons eminent in authority  of notable integrity    endued with special measures of divine grace  of wisdom  of   goodness  such as cannot be suspected of intemperate anger  of ill   nature  of ill will  or of ill design     in such cases as are above mentioned  a sort of evil speaking about   our neighbour may be allowable or excusable   but  for fear of   overdoing  great caution and temper is to be used  and we should   never apply any such limitations as cloaks to palliate unjust or   uncharitable dealing   generally it is more advisable to suppress   such eruptions of passion than to vent it  for seldom passion hath   not inordinate motions joined with it  or tendeth to good ends     and  however  it will do well to reflect on those cases  and to   remark some particulars about them     first  we may observe that in all these cases all possible   moderation  equity  and candour are to be used  so that no ill   speaking be practised beyond what is needful or convenient   even in   prosecution of offences  the bounds of truth  of equity  of humanity   and clemency are not to be transgressed   a judge must not lay on   the most criminal person more blame or contumely than the case will   bear  or than serveth the designs of justice   however our neighbour   doth incur the calamities of sin and of punishment  we must not be   insolent or contemptuous towards him   so we may learn by that law   of moses  backed with a notable reason    and it shall be  if the   wicked man be worthy to be beaten  that the judge cause him to lie   down  and to be beaten before his face  according to his fault by a   certain number   forty stripes he may give him  and not exceed  lest   if he should exceed  and beat him above those stripes  then thy   brother should seem vile unto thee    whence appears that we should   be careful of not vilifying an offender beyond measure   and how   mildly governors should proceed in the administration of justice    the example of joshua may teach us  who thus examineth achan  the   cause of so great mischief to the public    my son  give  i pray   thee  glory to the lord god of israel  and make confession unto him    and tell me now what thou hast done  and hide it not from me     my   son   what compellation could be more benign and kind   i pray   thee   what language could be more courteous and gentle   give glory   to god  and make confession   what words could be more inoffensively   pertinent   and when he sentenced that great malefactor  the cause   of so much mischief  this was all he said   why hast thou troubled   us  the lord will trouble thee   words void of contumely or   insulting  containing only a close intimation of the cause  and a   simple declaration of the event he was to undergo     secondly  likewise ministers  in the taxing sin and sinners  are to   proceed with great discretion and caution  with much gentleness and   meekness  signifying a tender pity of their infirmities  charitable   desires for their good  the best opinion of them  and the best hopes   for them  that may consist with any reason  according to those   apostolical rules    brethren  if a man be overtaken in a fault  ye   which are spiritual  restore such an one in the spirit of meekness    considering thyself  lest thou also be tempted   and   we that are   strong ought to bear the infirmities of the weak  and not to please   ourselves   and  more expressly   a servant of the lord must not   fight  but be gentle toward all  apt to teach  patient  in meekness   instructing those that oppose themselves    thus did st  peter   temper his reproof of simon magus with this wholesome and   comfortable advice    repent  therefore  from this thy wickedness    and pray god if perhaps the thought of thine heart may be forgiven   thee      thirdly  as for fraternal censure and reproof of faults  when it is   just and expedient to use it   ordinarily the calmest and mildest   way is the most proper  and most likely to obtain good success  it   commonly doth in a more kindly manner convey the sense thereof into   the heart  and therein more powerfully worketh remorse  than the   fierce and harsh way   clearly to show a man his fault  with the   reason proving it such  so that he becometh thoroughly convinced of   it  is sufficient to breed in him regret  and to shame him before   his own mind   to do more  in way of aggravation  of insulting on   him  of inveighing against him   as it doth often not well consist   with humanity  so it is seldom consonant to discretion  if we do  as   we ought  seek his health and amendment   humanity requireth that   when we undertake to reform our neighbour  we should take care not   to deform him  not to discourage or displease him more than is   necessary   when we would correct his manners  that we should also   consider his modesty  and consult his reputation   curam agentes     as seneca speaketh   non tantum salutis  sed et honestae cicatricis     having care not only to heal the wound  but to leave a comely scar   behind     be   adviseth st  austin   so displeased with iniquity    as to consider and consult humanity   for   zeal void of humanity is   not   saith st  chrysostom   zeal  but rather animosity  and reproof   not mixed with good will appeareth a kind of malignity    we should   so rebuke those who  by frailty or folly incident to mankind  have   fallen into misdemeanours  that they may perceive we do sincerely   pity their ill case  and tender their good  that we mean not to   upbraid their weakness or insult upon their misfortune  that we   delight not to inflict on them more grief than is plainly needful   and unavoidable  that we are conscious and sensible of our own   obnoxiousness to the like slips or falls  and do consider that we   also may be tempted  and being tempted  may be overborne   this they   cannot perceive or be persuaded of  except we temper our speech with   benignity and mildness   such speech prudence also dictateth  as   most useful and hopeful for producing the good ends honest   reprehension doth aim at  it mollifieth and it melteth a stubborn   heart  it subdueth and winneth a perverse will  it healeth   distempered affections   whereas roughly handling is apt to defeat   or obstruct the cure   rubbing the sore doth tend to exasperate and   inflame it   harsh speech rendereth advice odious and unsavoury    driveth from it and depriveth it of efficacy  it turneth regret for   a fault into displeasure and disdain against the reprover  it looks   not like the dealing of a kind friend  but like the persecution of a   spiteful enemy  it seemeth rather an ebullition of gall  or a   defluxion from rancour  than an expression of good will  the   offender will take it for a needless and pitiless tormenting  or for   a proud and tyrannical domineering over him   he that can bear a   friendly touch  will not endure to be lashed with angry and   reproachful words   in fine  all reproof ought to be seasoned with   discretion  with candour  with moderation  and meekness     fourthly  likewise in defence of truth  and maintenance of a good   cause  we may observe that commonly the fairest language is most   proper and advantageous  and that reproachful or foul terms are most   improper and prejudicial   a calm and meek way of discoursing doth   much advantage a good cause  as arguing the patron thereof to have   confidence in the cause itself  and to rely upon his strength   that   he is in a temper fit to apprehend it himself  and to maintain it    that he propoundeth it as a friend  wishing the hearer for his own   good to follow it  leaving him the liberty to judge  and choose for   himself   but rude speech  and contemptuous reflections on persons    as they do signify nothing to the question  so they commonly bring   much disadvantage and damage to the cause  creating mighty   prejudices against it  they argue much impotency in the advocate    and consequently little strength in what he maintains  that he is   little able to judge well  and altogether unapt to teach others    they intimate a diffidence in himself concerning his cause  and   that  despairing to maintain it by reason  he seeks to uphold it by   passion  that not being able to convince by fair means  he would   bear down by noise and clamour   that not skilling to get his suit   quietly  he would extort it by force  obtruding his conceits   violently as an enemy  or imposing them arbitrarily as a tyrant     thus doth he really disparage and slur his cause  however good and   defensible in itself     a modest and friendly style doth suit truth  it  like its author    doth usually reside  not in the rumbling wind  nor in the shaking   earthquake  nor in the raging fire  but  in the small still voice    sounding in this  it is most audible  most penetrant  and most   effectual  thus propounded  it is willingly hearkened to   for men   have no aversion from hearing those who seem to love them  and wish   them well   it is easily conceived  no prejudice or passion clouding   the apprehensive faculties  it is readily embraced  no animosity   withstanding or obstructing it   it is the sweetness of the lips    which  as the wise man telleth us  increaseth learning  disposing a   man to hear lessons of good doctrine  rendering him capable to   understand them  insinuating and impressing them upon the mind  the   affections being thereby unlocked  the passage becomes open to the   reason     but it is plainly a preposterous method of instructing  of deciding   controversies  of begetting peace  to vex and anger those concerned   by ill language   nothing surely doth more hinder the efficacy of   discourse  and prevent conviction  than doth this course  upon many   obvious accounts   it doth first put in a strong bar to attention     for no man willingly doth afford an ear to him whom he conceiveth   disaffected towards him   which opinion harsh words infallibly will   produce  no man can expect to hear truth from him whom he   apprehendeth disordered in his own mind  whom he seeth rude in his   proceedings  whom he taketh to be unjust in his dealing  as men   certainly will take those to be  who presume to revile others for   using their own judgment freely  and dissenting from them in   opinion   again  this course doth blind the hearer s mind  so that   he cannot discern what he that pretends to instruct him doth mean    or how he doth assert his doctrine   truth will not be discerned   through the smoke of wrathful expressions  right being defaced by   foul language will not appear  passion being excited will not suffer   a man to perceive the sense or the force of an argument   the will   also thereby is hardened and hindered from submitting to truth   in   such a case  non persuadebis  etiamsi persuaseris  although you stop   his mouth  you cannot subdue his heart  although he can no longer   fight  yet he never will yield   animosity raised by such usage   rendereth him invincibly obstinate in his conceits and courses     briefly  from this proceeding men become unwilling to mark  unfit to   apprehend  indisposed to embrace any good instruction or advice  it   maketh them indocile and intractable  averse from better   instruction  pertinacious in their opinions  and refractory in their   ways      every man   saith the wise man   shall kiss his lips that giveth a   right answer   but no man surely will be ready to kiss those lips   which are embittered with reproach  or defiled with dirty language     it is said of pericles  that with thundering and lightning he put   greece into confusion  such discourse may serve to confound things    it seldom tendeth to compose them   if reason will not pierce  rage   will scarce avail to drive it in   satirical virulency may vex men   sorely  but it hardly ever soundly converts them    few become wiser   or better by ill words    children may be frightened into compliance   by loud and severe reprimands  but men are to be allured by rational   persuasion backed with courteous usage  they may be sweetly drawn    they cannot be violently driven to change their judgment and   practice   whence that advice of the apostle   with meekness   instruct those that oppose themselves   doth no less savour of   wisdom than of goodness     fifthly  as for examples of extraordinary persons  which in some   cases do seem to authorise the practice of evil speaking  we may   consider that  as they had especial commission enabling them to do   some things beyond ordinary standing rules  wherein they are not to   be imitated   as they had especial illumination and direction  which   preserved them from swerving in particular cases from truth and   equity  so the tenor of their life did evidence that it was the   glory of god  the good of men  the necessity of the case  which   moved them to it   and of them also we may observe  that on divers   occasions  yea  generally  whenever only their private credit or   interest was concerned   although grievously provoked  they did out   of meekness  patience  and charity  wholly forbear reproachful   speech   our saviour  who sometimes upon special reason in his   discourses used such harsh words  yet when he was most spitefully   accused  reproached  and persecuted  did not open his mouth  or   return one angry word    being reviled  he did not   as st  peter    proposing his example to us  telleth us   revile again  suffering    he did not threaten    he used the softest language to judas  to the   soldiers  to pilate and herod  to the priests  etc   and the   apostles  who sometimes inveigh so zealously against the opposers   and perverters of truth  did in their private conversation and   demeanour strictly observe their own rules  of abstinence from   reproach    being reviled  we bless  being persecuted  we suffer   it   so doth st  paul represent their practice   and in reason we   should rather follow them in this their ordinary course  than in   their extraordinary sallies of practice     in fine  however in some cases and circumstances the matter may   admit such exceptions  so that all language disgraceful to our   neighbour is not ever culpable  yet the cases are so few and rare in   comparison  the practice commonly so dangerous and ticklish  that   worthily forbearing to reproach doth bear the style of a general   rule  and particularly  for clearer direction  we are in the   following cases obliged carefully to shun it  or in speaking about   our neighbour we must observe these cautions         we should never in severe terms inveigh against any man without   reasonable warrant  or presuming upon a good call and commission   thereto   as every man should not assume to himself the power of   administering justice  of trying  sentencing  and punishing   offenders   so must not every man take upon him to speak against   those who seem to do ill  which is a sort of punishment  including   the infliction of smart and damage upon the persons concerned     every man hath indeed a commission  in due place and season  with   discretion and moderation to admonish his neighbour offending  but   otherwise to speak ill of him  no private man hath just right or   authority  and therefore  in presuming to do it  he is disorderly   and irregular  trespassing beyond his bounds  usurping an undue   power to himself         we should never speak ill of any man without apparent just   cause   it must be just  we must not reproach men for things   innocent or indifferent  for not concurring in disputable opinions   with us  for not complying with our humour  for not serving our   interest  for not doing anything to which they are not obliged  or   for using their liberty in any case   it must be at least some   considerable fault  which we can so much as tax   it must also be   clear and certain  notorious and palpable  for to speak ill upon   slender conjectures  or doubtful suspicions  is full of iniquity       greek    they rail at things which they know not   is part of   those wicked men s character  whom st  jude doth so severely   reprehend   if  indeed  these conditions being wanting  we presume   to reproach any man  we do therein no less than slander him  which   to do is unlawful in any case  is in truth a most diabolical and   detestable crime   to impose odious names and characters on any   person  which he deserveth not  or without ground of truth  is to   play the devil  and hell itself scarce will own a fouler practice         we should not cast reproach upon any man without some necessary   reason   in charity  that charity which  covereth all sins   which    covereth a multitude of sins   we are bound to connive at the   defects  and to conceal the faults of our brethren  to extenuate and   excuse them  when apparent  so far as we may in truth and equity     we must not therefore ever produce them to light  or prosecute them   with severity  except very needful occasion urgeth  such as is the   glory and service of god  the maintenance of truth  the vindication   of innocence  the preservation of public justice and peace  the   amendment of our neighbour himself  or securing others from   contagion   barring such reasons  really being  not affectedly   pretended   we are bound not so much as to disclose  as to touch our   neighbour s faults  much more  not to blaze them about  not to   exaggerate them by vehement invectives         we should never speak ill of any man beyond measure  be the   cause never so just  the occasion never so necessary  we should yet   nowise be immoderate therein  exceeding the bounds prescribed by   truth  equity  and humanity   we should never speak worse of any man   whatever than he certainly deserveth  according to the most   favourable construction of his doings  never more than the cause   absolutely requireth   we should rather be careful to fall short of   what in rigorous truth might be said against him  than in the least   to pass beyond it   the best cause had better seem to suffer a   little by our reservedness in its defence  than any man be wronged   by our aspersing him  for god  the patron of truth and right  is   ever able to secure them without the succour of our unjust and   uncharitable dealing   the contrary practice hath indeed within it a   spice of slander  that is  of the worst iniquity         we must never speak ill of any man out of bad principles  or for   bad ends     no sudden or rash anger should instigate us thereto   for   let all   bitterness  and wrath  and anger  and clamour  and evil speaking be   put away from you  with all malice   is the apostolical precept    they are all associates and kindred  which are to be cast away   together   such anger itself is culpable  as a work of the flesh    and therefore to be suppressed  and all its brood therefore is also   to be smothered  the daughter of such a mother cannot be legitimate      the wrath of man worketh not the righteousness of god      we must not speak ill out of inveterate hatred or ill will   for   this murderous  this viperous disposition should itself be rooted   out of our hearts   whatever issueth from it cannot be otherwise   than very bad  it must be a poisonous breath that exhaleth from that   foul source     we must not be provoked thereto by any revengeful disposition  or   rancorous spleen  in regard to any injuries or discourtesies   received   for  as we must not revenge ourselves  or render evil in   any other way  so particularly not in this  which is commonly the   special instance expressly prohibited    render not evil for evil     saith st  peter   nor railing for railing  but contrariwise bless     or speak well  and  bless them   saith the lord   which curse you      bless   saith st  paul   and curse not      we must not also do it out of contempt  for we are not to slight our   brethren in our hearts   no man really  considering what he is    whence he came  how he is related  what he is capable of  can be   despicable   extreme naughtiness is indeed contemptible  but the   unhappy person that is engaged therein is rather to be pitied than   despised   however  charity bindeth us to stifle contemptuous   motions of heart  and not to vent them in vilifying expression     particularly  it is a barbarous practice  out of contempt to   reproach persons for natural imperfections  for meanness of   condition  for unlucky disasters  for any involuntary defects  this   being indeed to reproach mankind  unto which such things are   incident  to reproach providence  from the disposal whereof they do   proceed    whoso mocketh the poor  despiseth his maker   saith the   wise man  and the same may be said of him that reproachfully mocketh   him that is dull in parts  deformed in body  weak in health or   strength  defective in any such way     likewise we must not speak ill out of envy  because others do excel   us in any good quality  or exceed us in fortune   to harbour this   base and ugly disposition in our minds is unworthy of a man  who   should delight in all good springing up anywhere  and befalling any   man  naturally allied unto him   it is most unworthy of a christian    who should tender his brother s good as his own  and rejoice with   those that rejoice   from thence to be drawn to cast reproach upon   any man  is horrible and heinous wickedness     neither should we ever use reproach as a means of compassing any   design we do affect or aim at   tis an unwarrantable engine of   raising us to wealth  dignity  or repute   to grow by the   diminution  to rise by the depression  to shine by the eclipse of   others  to build a fortune upon the ruins of our neighbour s   reputation  is that which no honourable mind can affect  no honest   man will endeavour   our own wit  courage  and industry  managed   with god s assistance and blessing  are sufficient  and only lawful   instruments of prosecuting honest enterprises  we need not  we must   not instead of them employ our neighbour s disgrace  no worldly good   is worth purchasing at such a rate  no project worth achieving by   such foul ways     neither should we out of malignity  to cherish or gratify ill   humour  use this practice   it is observable of some persons  that   not out of any formed displeasure  grudge  or particular   disaffection  nor out of any particular design  but merely out of a    greek   an ill disposition  springing up from nature  or contracted   by use  they are apt to carp at any action  and with sharp reproach   to bite any man that comes in their way  thereby feeding and   soothing that evil inclination   but as this inhuman and currish   humour should be corrected  and extirpated from our hearts  so   should the issues thereof at our mouths be stopped  the bespattering   our neighbour s good name should never afford any satisfaction or   delight unto us     nor out of wantonness should we speak ill  for our divertisement or   sport   for our neighbour s reputation is too great and precious a   thing to be played with  or offered up to sport  we are very foolish   in so disvaluing it  very naughty in so misusing it   our wits are   very barren  our brains are ill furnished with store of knowledge    if we can find no other matter of conversation     nor out of negligence and inadvertency should we sputter out   reproachful speech  shooting ill words at rovers  or not regarding   who stands in our way   among all temerities this is one of the most   noxious  and therefore very culpable     in fine  we should never speak concerning our neighbour from any   other principle than charity  or to any other intent but what is   charitable  such as tendeth to his good  or at least is consistent   therewith    let all your things   saith st  paul   be done in   charity   and words are most of the things we do concerning our   neighbour  wherein we may express charity   in all our speeches    therefore  touching him  we should plainly show that we have a care   of his reputation  that we tender his interest  that we even desire   his content and repose   even when reason and need do so require   that we should disclose and reprehend his faults  we may  we should   by the manner and scope of our speech signify thus much   which   rule  were it observed  if we should never speak ill otherwise than   out of charity  surely most ill speaking would be cut off  most  i   fear  of our tattling about others  much of our gossiping would be   marred     indeed  so far from bitter or sour our language should be  that it   ought to be sweet and pleasant  so far from rough and harsh  that it   should be courteous and obliging  so far from signifying wrath  ill   will  contempt  or animosity  that it should express tender   affection  good esteem  sincere respect towards our brethren  and be   apt to produce the like in them towards us   the sense of them   should be grateful to the heart  the very sound and accent of them   should be delightful to the ear   every one should please his   neighbour for his good to edification   our words should always be    greek   with grace  seasoned with salt  they should have the grace   of courtesy  they should be seasoned with the salt of discretion  so   as to be sweet and savoury to the hearers   commonly ill language is   a certain sign of inward enmity and ill will   good will is wont to   show itself in good terms  it clotheth even its grief handsomely    and its displeasure carrieth favour in its face  its rigour is civil   and gentle  tempered with pity for the faults and errors which it   disliketh  with the desire of their amendment and recovery whom it   reprehendeth   it would inflict no more evil than is necessary  it   would cure its neighbour s disease without exasperating his   patience  troubling his modesty  or impairing his credit   as it   always judgeth candidly  so it never condemneth extremely       ii   but so much for the explication of this precept  and the   directive part of our discourse   i shall now briefly propound some   inducements to the observance thereof         let us consider that nothing more than railing and reviling is   opposite to the nature  and inconsistent with the tenor of our   religion  which  as even a heathen did observe of it  nil nisi   justum suadet  et lene  doth recommend nothing but what is very just   and mild  which propoundeth the practices of charity  meekness    patience  peaceableness  moderation  equity  alacrity  or good   humour  as its principal laws  and declareth them the chief fruits   of the divine spirit and grace  which chargeth us to curb and   compose all our passions  more particularly to restrain and repress   anger  animosity  envy  malice  and such like dispositions  as the   fruits of carnality and corrupt lust  which consequently drieth up   all the sources or dammeth up the sluices of bad language   as it   doth above all things oblige us to bear no ill will in our hearts    so it chargeth us to vent none with our mouths         it is therefore often expressly condemned and prohibited as   evil    tis the property of the wicked  a character of those who   work iniquity  to  whet their tongues like a sword  and bend their   bows to shoot their arrows  even bitter words          no practice hath more severe punishments denounced to it than   this   the railer  and it is indeed a very proper and fit punishment   for him  he being exceedingly bad company  is to be banished out of   all good society  thereto st  paul adjudgeth him    i have   saith   he   now written unto you  not to keep company  if any man that is   called a brother be a fornicator  or covetous  or an idolater  or a   railer  or a drunkard  or an extortioner  with such an one not to   eat    ye see what company the railer hath in the text  and with   what a crew of people he is coupled  but no good company he is   allowed elsewhere  every good christian should avoid him as a blot    and a pest of conversation  and finally he is sure to be excluded   from the blessed society above in heaven  for  neither thieves  nor   covetous  nor drunkards  nor revilers  nor extortioners shall   inherit the kingdom of god   and  without   without the heavenly   city   are dogs   saith st  john in his revelation  that is  those   chiefly who out of currish spite or malignity do frowardly bark at   their neighbours  or cruelly bite them with reproachful language         if we look upon such language in its own nature  what is it but   a symptom of a foul  a weak  a disordered and a distempered mind      tis the smoke of inward rage and malice    tis a stream that cannot   issue from a sweet spring   tis a storm that cannot bluster out of a   calm region    the words of the pure are pleasant words   as the   wise man saith         this practice doth plainly signify low spirit  ill breeding  and   bad manners  and thence misbecometh any wise  any honest  any   honourable person   it agreeth to children  who are unapt and   unaccustomed to deal in matters considerable  to squabble  to women   of meanest rank  apt  by nature  or custom  to be transported with   passion  to scold   in our modern languages it is termed villainy    as being proper for rustic boors  or men of coarsest education and   employment  who  having their minds debased by being conversant in   meanest affairs  do vent their sorry passions  and bicker about   their petty concernments  in such strains  who also  being not   capable of a fair reputation  or sensible of disgrace to themselves    do little value the credit of others  or care for aspersing it   but   such language is unworthy of those persons  and cannot easily be   drawn from them  who are wont to exercise their thoughts about   nobler matters  who are versed in affairs manageable only by calm   deliberation and fair persuasion  not by impetuous and provocative   rudeness  which do never work otherwise upon masculine souls than so   as to procure disdain and resistance   such persons  knowing the   benefit of a good name  being wont to possess a good repute  prizing   their own credit as a considerable good  will never be prone to   bereave others of the like by opprobrious speech   a noble enemy   will never speak of his enemy in bad terms     we may further consider that all wise  all honest  all ingenuous   persons have an aversion from ill speaking  and cannot entertain it   with any acceptance or complacence  that only ill natured  unworthy    and naughty people are its willing auditors  or do abet it with   applause   the good man  in psalm xv   non accipit opprobrium  doth   not take up  or accept  a reproach against his neighbour    but a   wicked doer   saith the wise man   giveth heed to false lips  and a   liar giveth ear to a naughty tongue    and what reasonable man will   do that which is disgustful to the wise and good  is grateful only   to the foolish and baser sort of men   i pretermit that using this   sort of language doth incapacitate a man for benefiting his   neighbour  and defeateth his endeavours for his edification    disparaging a good cause  prejudicing the defence of truth    obstructing the effects of good instruction and wholesome reproof    as we did before remark and declare   further          he that useth this kind of speech doth  as harm and trouble   others  so create many great inconveniences and mischiefs to himself   thereby   nothing so inflameth the wrath of men  so provoketh their   enmity  so breedeth lasting hatred and spite  as do contumelious   words   they are often called swords and arrows  and as such they   pierce deeply  and cause most grievous smart  which men feeling are   enraged  and accordingly will strive to requite them in the like   manner and in all other obvious ways of revenge   hence strife    clamour  and tumult  care  suspicion  and fear  danger and trouble    sorrow and regret  do seize on the reviler  and he is sufficiently   punished for this dealing   no man can otherwise live than in   perpetual fear of reciprocal like usage from him whom he is   conscious of having so abused   whence  if not justice  or charity   towards others  yet love and pity of ourselves should persuade us to   forbear it as disquietful  incommodious  and mischievous to us     we should indeed certainly enjoy much love  much concord  much   quiet  we should live in great safety and security  we should be   exempted from much care and fear  if we would restrain ourselves   from abusing and offending our neighbour in this kind   being   conscious of so just and innocent demeanour towards him  we should   converse with him in a pleasant freedom and confidence  not   suspecting any bad language or ill usage from him         hence with evidently good reason is he that useth such language   called a fool   and he that abstaineth from it is commended as wise      a fool s lips enter into contention  and his mouth calleth for   strokes   a fool s mouth is his destruction  and his lips are the   snare of his soul   he that refraineth his tongue is wise   in the   tongue of the wise is health   he that keepeth his lips  keepeth his   life   but he that openeth wide his mouth   that is  in evil   speaking  gaping with clamour and vehemency   shall have   destruction   the words of a wise man s mouth are gracious   but the   lips of a fool will swallow up himself   death and life are in the   power of the tongue  and they that love it shall eat the fruit   thereof   that is  of the one or the other  answerably to the kind   of speech they choose     in fine  very remarkable is that advice  or resolution of the grand   point concerning the best way of living happily  in the psalmist      what man is he that desireth life  and loveth many days  that he   may see good   keep thy tongue from evil  and thy lips from speaking   guile    abstinence from ill speaking he seemeth to propose as the   first step towards the fruition of a durably happy life         lastly  we may consider that it is a grievous perverting of the   design of speech  that excellent faculty  which so much   distinguisheth us from  so highly advanceth us above other   creatures  to use it to the defaming and disquieting of our   neighbour   it was given us as an instrument of beneficial commerce   and delectable conversation  that with it we might assist and   advise  might cheer and comfort one another   we  therefore  in   employing it to the disgrace  vexation  damage or prejudice in any   kind of our neighbour  do foully abuse it  and so doing  render   ourselves indeed worse than dumb beasts   for better far it were   that we could say nothing  than that we should speak ill      now the god of grace and peace        make us perfect in every good   work to do his will  working in us that which is well pleasing in   his sight  through jesus christ  to whom be glory for ever and ever     amen          the folly of slander         part        he that uttereth slander is a fool    prov  x         general declamations against vice and sin are indeed excellently   useful  as rousing men to consider and look about them   but they do   often want effect  because they only raise confused apprehensions of   things  and indeterminate propensions to action  which usually    before men thoroughly perceive or resolve what they should practise    do decay and vanish   as he that cries out  fire   doth stir up   people  and inspireth them with a kind of hovering tendency every   way  yet no man thence to purpose moveth until he be distinctly   informed where the mischief is  then do they  who apprehend   themselves concerned  run hastily to oppose it   so  till we   particularly discern where our offences lie  till we distinctly know   the heinous nature and the mischievous consequences of them   we   scarce will effectually apply ourselves to correct them   whence it   is requisite that men should be particularly acquainted with their   sins  and by proper arguments be dissuaded from them     in order whereto i have now selected one sin to describe  and   dissuade from  being in nature as vile  and in practice as common    as any other whatever that hath prevailed among men   it is slander    a sin which in all times and places hath been epidemical and rife    but which especially doth seem to reign and rage in our age and   country     there are principles innate to men  which ever have  and ever will   incline them to this offence   eager appetites to secular and   sensual goods  violent passions  urging the prosecution of what men   affect  wrath and displeasure against those who stand in the way of   compassing their desires  emulation and envy towards those who   happen to succeed better  or to attain a greater share in such   things  excessive self love  unaccountable malignity and vanity  are   in some degrees connatural to all men  and ever prompt them to this   dealing  as appearing the most efficacious  compendious  and easy   way of satisfying such appetites  of promoting such designs  of   discharging such passions   slander thence hath always been a   principal engine whereby covetous  ambitious  envious  ill natured    and vain persons have striven to supplant their competitors  and   advance themselves  meaning thereby to procure  what they chiefly   prize and like  wealth  or dignity  or reputation  favour and power   in the court  respect and interest with the people     but from especial causes our age peculiarly doth abound in this   practice  for  besides the common dispositions inclining thereto    there are conceits newly coined  and greedily entertained by many    which seem purposely levelled at the disparagement of piety    charity  and justice  substituting interest in the room of   conscience  authorising and commending for good and wise  all ways   serving to private advantage   there are implacable dissensions    fierce animosities  and bitter zeals sprung up  there is an extreme   curiosity  niceness  and delicacy of judgment   there is a mighty   affectation of seeming wise and witty by any means  there is a great   unsettlement of mind  and corruption of manners  generally diffused   over people   from which sources it is no wonder that this flood   hath so overflown  that no banks can restrain it  no fences are able   to resist it  so that ordinary conversation is full of it  and no   demeanour can be secure from it     if we do mark what is done in many  might i not say  in most     companies  what is it but one telling malicious stories of  or   fastening odious characters upon another   what do men commonly   please themselves in so much  as in carping and harshly censuring    in defaming and abusing their neighbours   is it not the sport and   divertisement of many  to cast dirt in the faces of all they meet   with  to bespatter any man with foul imputations   doth not in every   corner a momus lurk  from the venom of whose spiteful or petulant   tongue no eminency of rank  dignity of place  or sacredness of   office  no innocence or integrity of life  no wisdom or   circumspection in behaviour  no good nature or benignity in dealing   and carriage  can protect any person   do not men assume to   themselves a liberty of telling romances  and framing characters   concerning their neighbour  as freely as a poet doth about hector or   turnus  thersites or draucus   do they not usurp a power of playing   with  or tossing about  of tearing in pieces their neighbour s good   name  as if it were the veriest toy in the world   do not many   having a form of godliness  some of them  demurely  others   confidently  both without any sense of  or remorse for what they do    backbite their brethren   is it not grown so common a thing to   asperse causelessly that no man wonders at it  that few dislike    that scarce any detest it  that most notorious calumniators are   heard  not only with patience  but with pleasure  yea  are even held   in vogue and reverence as men of a notable talent  and very   serviceable to their party  so that slander seemeth to have lost its   nature  and not to be now an odious sin  but a fashionable humour  a   way of pleasing entertainment  a fine knack  or curious feat of   policy  so that no man at least taketh himself or others to be   accountable for what is said in this way   is not  in fine  the case   become such  that whoever hath in him any love of truth  any sense   of justice or honesty  any spark of charity towards his brethren    shall hardly be able to satisfy himself in the conversations he   meeteth  but will be tempted  with the holy prophet  to wish himself   sequestered from society  and cast into solitude  repeating those   words of his   oh  that i had in the wilderness a lodging place of   wayfaring men  that i might leave my people  and go from them   for   they are         an assembly of treacherous men  and they bend their   tongues like their bow for lies    this he wished in an age so   resembling ours  that i fear the description with equal patness may   suit both    take ye heed   said he then  and may we not advise the   like now    every one of his neighbour  and trust ye not in any   brother   for every brother will utterly supplant  and every   neighbour will walk with slanders   they will deceive every one his   neighbour  and will not speak the truth  they have taught their   tongue to speak lies  and weary themselves to commit iniquity      such being the state of things  obvious to experience  no discourse   may seem more needful  or more useful  than that which serveth to   correct or check this practice   which i shall endeavour to do       by describing the nature      by declaring the folly of it   or   showing it to be very true which the wise man here asserteth   he   that uttereth slander is a fool    which particulars i hope so to   prosecute  that any man shall be able easily to discern  and ready   heartily to detest this practice       i   for explication of its nature  we may describe slander to be the   uttering false  or equivalent to false  morally false  speech   against our neighbour  in prejudice to his fame  his safety  his   welfare  or concernment in any kind  out of malignity  vanity    rashness  ill nature  or bad design   that which is in holy   scripture forbidden and reproved under several names and notions     of bearing false witness  false accusation  railing censure    sycophantry  tale bearing  whispering  backbiting  supplanting    taking up reproach   which terms some of them do signify the nature    others denote the special kinds  others imply the manners  others   suggest the ends of this practice   but it seemeth most fully   intelligible by observing the several kinds and degrees thereof  as   also by reflecting on the divers ways and manners of practising it     the principal kinds thereof i observe to be these         the grossest kind of slander is that which in the decalogue is   called  bearing false testimony against our neighbour  that is    flatly charging him with facts which he never committed  and is   nowise guilty of   as in the case of naboth  when men were suborned   to say   naboth did blaspheme god and the king   and as was david s   case  when he thus complained   false witnesses did rise up  they   laid to my charge things that i knew not of    this kind in the   highest way  that is  in judicial proceedings  is more rare  and of   all men  they who are detected to practise it  are held most vile   and infamous  as being plainly the most pernicious and perilous   instruments of injustice  the most desperate enemies of all men s   right and safety that can be   but also out of the court there are   many knights errant of the post  whose business it is to run about   scattering false reports  sometimes loudly proclaiming them in open   companies  sometimes closely whispering them in dark corners  thus   infecting conversation with their poisonous breath   these no less   notoriously are guilty of this kind  as bearing always the same   malice  and sometimes breeding as ill effects         another kind is  affixing scandalous names  injurious epithets    and odious characters upon persons  which they deserve not   as when   corah and his accomplices did accuse moses of being ambitious    unjust  and tyrannical   when the pharisees called our lord an   impostor  a blasphemer  a sorcerer  a glutton and wine bibber  an   incendiary and perverter of the people  one that spake against   caesar  and forbade to give tribute   when the apostles were charged   with being pestilent  turbulent  factious and seditious fellows     this sort being very common  and thence in ordinary repute not so   bad  yet in just estimation may be judged  even worse than the   former  as doing to our neighbour more heavy and more irreparable   wrong   for it imposeth on him really more blame  and that such   which he can hardly shake off   because the charge signifieth habit   of evil  and includeth many acts  then  being general and   indefinite  can scarce be disproved   he  for instance  that calleth   a sober man drunkard  doth impute to him many acts of such   intemperance  some really past  others probably future   and no   particular time or place being specified  how can a man clear   himself of that imputation  especially with those who are not   thoroughly acquainted with his conversation   so he that calleth a   man unjust  proud  perverse  hypocritical  doth load him with most   grievous faults  which it is not possible that the most innocent   person should discharge himself from         like to that kind is this   aspersing a man s actions with harsh   censures and foul terms  importing that they proceed from ill   principles  or tend to bad ends  so as it doth not or cannot appear     thus when we say of him that is generously hospitable  that he is   profuse  of him that is prudently frugal  that he is niggardly  of   him that is cheerful and free in his conversation  that he is vain   or loose  of him that is serious and resolute in a good way  that he   is sullen or morose  of him that is conspicuous and brisk in   virtuous practice  that it is ambition or ostentation which prompts   him  of him that is close and bashful in the like good way  that it   is sneaking stupidity  or want of spirit  of him that is reserved    that it is craft  of him that is open  that it is simplicity in him    when we ascribe a man s liberality and charity to vainglory  or   popularity  his strictness of life  and constancy  in devotion  to   superstition  or hypocrisy   when  i say  we pass such censures  or   impose such characters on the laudable or innocent practice of our   neighbours  we are indeed slanderers  imitating therein the great   calumniator  who thus did slander even god himself  imputing his   prohibition of the fruit unto envy towards men   god   said he     doth know that in the day ye eat thereof  your eyes shall be   opened  and ye shall be as gods  knowing good and evil   who thus   did ascribe the steady piety of job  not to a conscientious love and   fear of god  but to policy and selfish design    doth job fear god   for nought      whoever  indeed  pronounceth concerning his neighbour s intentions   otherwise than as they are evidently expressed by words  or   signified by overt actions  is a slanderer  because he pretendeth to   know  and dareth to aver  that which he nowise possibly can tell   whether it be true  because the heart is exempt from all   jurisdiction here  is only subject to the government and trial of   another world  because no man can judge concerning the truth of such   accusations  because no man can exempt or defend himself from them     so that apparently such practice doth thwart all course of justice   and equity         another kind is  perverting a man s words or actions   disadvantageously by affected misconstruction   all words are   ambiguous  and capable of different senses  some fair  some more   foul  all actions have two handles  one that candour and charity   will  another that disingenuity and spite may lay hold on  and in   such cases to misapprehend is a calumnious procedure  arguing   malignant disposition and mischievous design   thus when two men did   witness that our lord affirmed  he  could demolish the temple  and   rear it again in three days   although he did indeed speak words to   that purpose  meaning them in a figurative sense  discernible enough   to those who would candidly have minded his drift and way of   speaking  yet they who crudely alleged them against him are called   false witnesses    at last   saith the gospel   came two false   witnesses  and said  this fellow said  i am able to destroy the   temple   etc   thus also when some certified of st  stephen  as   having said that  jesus of nazareth should destroy that place  and   change the customs that moses delivered   although probably he did   speak words near to that purpose  yet are those men called false   witnesses    and   saith st  luke   they set up false witnesses    which said  this man ceaseth not to speak blasphemous words   etc     which instances plainly do show  if we would avoid the guilt of   slander  how careful we should be to interpret fairly and favourably   the words and the actions of our neighbour         another sort of this practice is  partial and lame   representation of men s discourse  or their practice  suppressing   some part of the truth in them  or concealing some circumstances   about them which might serve to explain  to excuse  or to extenuate   them   in such a manner easily  without uttering any logical   untruth  one may yet grievously calumniate   thus suppose a man   speaketh a thing upon supposition  or with exception  or in way of   objection  or merely for disputation sake  in order to the   discussion or clearing of truth  he that should report him asserting   it absolutely  unlimitedly  positively and peremptorily  as his own   settled judgment  would notoriously calumniate   if one should be   inveigled by fraud  or driven by violence  or slip by chance into a   bad place or bad company  he that should so represent the gross of   that accident  as to breed an opinion of that person  that out of   pure disposition and design he did put himself there  doth   slanderously abuse that innocent person   the reporter in such cases   must not think to defend himself by pretending that he spake nothing   false  for such propositions  however true in logic  may justly be   deemed lies in morality  being uttered with a malicious and   deceitful  that is  with a calumnious  mind  being apt to impress   false conceits and to produce hurtful effects concerning our   neighbour   there are slanderous truths as well as slanderous   falsehoods   when truth is uttered with a deceitful heart  and to a   base end  it becomes a lie    he that speaketh truth   saith the   wise man   showeth forth righteousness   but a false witness   deceit    deceiving is the proper work of slander   and truth abused   to that end putteth on its nature  and will engage into like guilt         another kind of calumny is  by instilling sly suggestions  which   although they do not downrightly assert falsehoods  yet they breed   sinister opinions in the hearers  especially in those who  from   weakness or credulity  from jealousy or prejudice  from negligence   or inadvertency  are prone to entertain them   this is done many   ways   by propounding wily suppositions  shrewd insinuations  crafty   questions  and specious comparisons  intimating a possibility  or   inferring some likelihood of  and thence inducing to believe the   fact    doth not   saith this kind of slanderer   his temper incline   him to do thus  may not his interest have swayed him thereto  had he   not fair opportunity and strong temptation to it  hath he not acted   so in like cases   judge you therefore whether he did it not    thus   the close slanderer argueth  and a weak or prejudiced person is   thereby so caught  that he presently is ready thence to conclude the   thing done   again    he doeth well   saith the sycophant   it is   true  but why  and to what end   is it not  as most men do  out of   ill design  may he not dissemble now  may he not recoil hereafter    have not others made as fair a show  yet we know what came of it      thus do calumnious tongues pervert the judgments of men to think ill   of the most innocent  and meanly of the worthiest actions   even   commendation itself is often used calumniously  with intent to breed   dislike and ill will towards a person commended in envious or   jealous ears  or so as to give passage to dispraises  and render the   accusations following more credible    tis an artifice commonly   observed to be much in use there  where the finest tricks of   supplanting are practised  with greatest effect  so that pessimum   inimicorum genus  laudantes  there is no more pestilent enemy than a   malevolent praiser   all these kinds of dealing  as they issue from   the principles of slander  and perform its work  so they deservedly   bear the guilt thereof         a like kind is that of oblique and covert reflections  when a   man doth not directly or expressly charge his neighbour with faults    but yet so speaketh that he is understood  or reasonably presumed to   do it   this is a very cunning and very mischievous way of   slandering  for therein the skulking calumniator keepeth a reserve   for himself  and cutteth off from the person concerned the means of   defence   if he goeth to clear himself from the matter of such   aspersions    what need   saith this insidious speaker   of that    must i needs mean you  did i name you  why do you then assume it to   yourself  do you not prejudge yourself guilty   i did not  but your   own conscience  it seemeth  doth accuse you   you are so jealous and   suspicious  as persons overwise or guilty use to be    so meaneth   this serpent out of the hedge securely and unavoidably to bite his   neighbour  and is in that respect more base and more hurtful than   the most flat and positive slanderer         another kind is that of magnifying and aggravating the faults of   others  raising any small miscarriage into a heinous crime  any   slender defect into an odious vice  and any common infirmity into a   strange enormity  turning a small  mote in the eye  of our neighbour   into a huge  beam   a little dimple in his face into a monstrous   wen   this is plainly slander  at least in degree  and according to   the surplusage whereby the censure doth exceed the fault   as he   that  upon the score of a small debt  doth extort a great sum  is no   less a thief  in regard to what amounts beyond his due  than if   without any pretence he had violently or fraudulently seized on it     so he is a slanderer that  by heightening faults or imperfections    doth charge his neighbour with greater blame  or load him with more   disgrace than he deserves    tis not only slander to pick a hole   where there is none  but to make that wider which is  so that it   appeareth more ugly  and cannot so easily be mended   for charity is   wont to extenuate faults  justice doth never exaggerate them   as no   man is exempt from some defects  or can live free from some   misdemeanours  so by this practice every man may be rendered very   odious and infamous         another kind of slander is  imputing to our neighbour s   practice  judgment  or profession  evil consequences  apt to render   him odious  or despicable  which have no dependence on them  or   connection with them   there do in every age occur disorders and   mishaps  springing from various complications of causes  working   some of them in a more open and discernible  others in a more secret   and subtle way  especially from divine judgment and providence   checking or chastising sin    from such occurrences it is common to   snatch occasion and matter of calumny   those who are disposed this   way  are ready peremptorily to charge them upon whomsoever they   dislike or dissent from  although without any apparent cause  or   upon most frivolous and senseless pretences  yea  often when reason   showeth quite the contrary  and they who are so charged are in just   esteem of all men the least obnoxious to such accusations   so   usually the best friends of mankind  those who most heartily wish   the peace and prosperity of the world and most earnestly to their   power strive to promote them  have all the disturbances and   disasters happening charged on them by those fiery vixens  who  in   pursuance of their base designs  or gratification of their wild   passions  really do themselve embroil things  and raise miserable   combustions in the world   so it is that they who have the   conscience to do mischief  will have the confidence also to disavow   the blame and the iniquity  to lay the burden of it on those who are   most innocent   thus  whereas nothing more disposeth men to live   orderly and peaceably  nothing more conduceth to the settlement and   safety of the public  nothing so much draweth blessings down from   heaven upon the commonwealth  as true religion  yet nothing hath   been more ordinary than to attribute all the miscarriages and   mischiefs that happened unto it  even those are laid at his door    which plainly do arise from the contempt or neglect of it  being the   natural fruits or the just punishments of irreligion   king ahab by   forsaking god s commandments  and following wicked superstitions    had troubled israel  drawing sore judgments and calamities thereon    yet had he the heart and the face to charge those events on the   great assertor of piety  elias    art thou he that troubleth   israel    the jews by provocation of divine justice had set   themselves in a fair way towards desolation and ruin  this event to   come they had the presumption to lay upon the faith of our lord s   doctrine    if   said they   we let him alone  all men will believe   on him  and the romans shall come  and take away our place and   nation   whereas  in truth  a compliance with his directions and   admonitions had been the only means to prevent those presaged   mischiefs   and  si tibris ascenderit in maenia  if any public   calamity did appear  then christianos ad leones  christians must be   charged and persecuted as the causes thereof   to them it was that   julian and other pagans did impute all the concussions  confusions    and devastations falling upon the roman empire   the sacking of rome   by the goths they cast upon christianity  for the vindication of it   from which reproach st  austin did write those renowned books de   civitate dei   so liable are the best and most innocent sort of men   to be calumniously accused in this manner     another practice  worthily bearing the guilt of slander  is  aiding   and being accessory thereto  by anywise furthering  cherishing    abetting it   he that by crafty significations of ill will doth   prompt the slanderer to vent his poison  he that by a willing   audience and attention doth readily suck it up  or who greedily   swalloweth it down by credulous approbation and assent  he that   pleasingly relisheth and smacketh at it  or expresseth a delightful   complacence therein   as he is a partner in the fact  so he is a   sharer in the guilt   there are not only slanderous throats  but   slanderous ears also  not only wicked inventions  which engender and   brood lies  but wicked assents  which hatch and foster them   not   only the spiteful mother that conceiveth such spurious brats  but   the midwife that helpeth to bring them forth  the nurse that feedeth   them  the guardian that traineth them up to maturity  and setteth   them forth to live in the world  as they do really contribute to   their subsistence  so deservedly they partake in the blame due to   them  and must be responsible for the mischief they do   for indeed   were it not for such free entertainers  such nourishers  such   encouragers of them  slanderers commonly would die in the womb  or   prove still born  or presently entering into the cold air  would   expire  or for want of nourishment soon would starve   it is such   friends and patrons of them who are the causes that they are so   rife  they it is who set ill natured  base  and designing people   upon devising  searching after  and picking up malicious and idle   stories   were it not for such customers  the trade of calumniating   would fall   many pursue it merely out of servility and flattery  to   tickle the ears  to soothe the humour  to gratify the malignant   disposition or ill will of others  who upon the least discouragement   would give over the practice   if therefore we would exempt   ourselves from all guilt of slander  we must not only abstain from   venting it  but forbear to regard or countenance it   for  he is     saith the wise man   a wicked doer who giveth heed to false lips    and a liar who giveth ear to a naughty tongue    yea  if we   thoroughly would be clear from it  we must show an aversion from   hearing it  an unwillingness to believe it  an indignation against   it  so either stifling it in the birth  or condemning it to death    being uttered   this is the sure way to destroy it  and to prevent   its mischief   if we would stop our ears  we should stop the   slanderer s mouth  if we would resist the calumniator  he would fly   from us  if we would reprove him  we should repel him   for   as the   north wind driveth away rain  so   the wise man telleth us   doth an   angry countenance a backbiting tongue      these are the chief and most common kinds of slander  and there are   several ways of practising them worthy our observing  that we may   avoid them  namely these           the most notoriously heinous way is  forging and immediately   venting ill stories   as it is said of doeg   thy tongue deviseth   mischief   and of another like companion   thou givest thy mouth to   evil  and thy tongue frameth deceit   and as our lord saith of the   devil   when he speaketh a lie   greek   he speaketh of his own  for   he is a liar  and the father of it    this palpably is the supreme   pitch of calumny  incapable of any qualifications or excuse   hell   cannot go beyond this  the cursed fiend himself cannot worse employ   his wit than in minting wrongful falsehoods         another way is  receiving from others  and venting such stories    which they who do it certainly know or may reasonably presume to be   false  the becoming hucksters of counterfeit wares  or factors in   this vile trade   there is no false coiner who hath not some   accomplices and emissaries ready to take from his hand and put off   his money  and such slanderers at second hand are scarce less guilty   than the first authors   he that breweth lies may have more wit and   skill  but the broacher showeth the like malice and wickedness   in   this there is no great difference between the great devil  that   frameth scandalous reports  and the little imps that run about and   disperse them         another way is  when one without competent examination  due   weighing  and just reason  doth admit and spread tales prejudicial   to his neighbour s welfare  relying for his warrant  as to the truth   of them  upon any slight or slender authority   this is a very   common and current practice   men presume it lawful enough to say   over whatever they hear  to report anything  if they can quote an   author for it    it is not   say they   my invention  i tell it as i   heard it   sit fides penes authorem  let him that informed me   undergo the blame if it prove false    so do they conceive   themselves excusable for being the instruments of injurious disgrace   and damage to their neighbours   but they greatly mistake therein    for as this practice commonly doth arise from the same wicked   principles  at least in some degree  and produceth altogether the   like mischievous effects  as the wilful devising and conveying   slander   so it no less thwarteth the rules of duty  the laws of   equity  god hath prohibited it  and reason doth condemn it    thou   shalt not   saith god in the law   go up and down as a tale bearer   among thy people   as a talebearer  as rachil  that is   as a   merchant or trader in ill reports and stories concerning our   neighbour  to his prejudice   not only the framing of them  but the   dealing in them beyond reason or necessity  is interdicted   and it   is part of a good man s character in psalm xv   non accipit   opprobrium   he taketh not up a reproach against his neighbour     that is  he doth not easily entertain it  much less doth he   effectually propagate it   and in our text   he   it is said   that   uttereth slander   not only he that conceiveth it   is a fool      and in reason  before exact trial and cognisance  to meddle with the   fame and interest of another  is evidently a practice full of   iniquity  such as no man can allow in his own case  or brook being   used towards himself without judging himself to be extremely abused   by such reporters   in all reason and equity  yea  in all   discretion  before we yield credence to any report concerning our   neighbour  or venture to relate it  many things are carefully to be   weighed and scanned   we should  concerning our author  consider   whether he be not a particular enemy  or disaffected to him     whether he be not ill humoured  or a delighter in telling bad   stories  whether he be not dishonest  or unregardful of justice in   his dealings and discourse  whether he be not vain  or careless of   what he saith  whether he be not light or credulous  or apt to be   imposed upon by any small appearance  whether  at least in the   present case  he be not negligent  or too forward and rash in   speaking   we should also  concerning the matter reported  mind   whether it be possible or probable  whether suitable to the   disposition of our neighbour  to his principles  to the constant   tenor of his practice  whether the action imputed to him be not   liable to misapprehension  or his words to misconstruction   all   reason and equity do  i say  exact from us  diligently to consider   such things  before we do either embrace ourselves or transmit unto   others any story concerning our neighbour  lest unadvisedly we do   him irreparable wrong and mischief   briefly  we should take his   case for our own  and consider whether we ourselves should be   content that upon like grounds or testimonies any man should   believe  or report  disgraceful things concerning us   if we fail to   do thus  we do  vainly  or rashly  or maliciously  conspire with the   slanderer to the wrong of our innocent neighbour  and that in the   psalmist  by a parity of reason  may be transferred to us   thou   hast consented unto the liar  and hast partaken with the  author of   calumny         of kin to this way is the assenting to popular rumours  and   thence affirming matters of obloquy to our neighbour   every one by   experience knows how easily false news do rise  and how nimbly they   scatter themselves  how often they are raised from nothing  how soon   they from small sparks grow into a great blaze  how easily from one   thing they are transformed into another  especially news of this   kind  which do suit and feed the bad humour of the vulgar    tis   obvious to any man how true that is of tacitus  how void of   consideration  of judgment  of equity  the busy and talking part of   mankind is   whoever therefore gives heed to flying tales  and   thrusts himself into the herd of those who spread them  is either   strangely injudicious  or very malignantly disposed   if he want not   judgment  he cannot but know that when he complieth with popular   fame  it is mere chance that he doth not slander  or rather it is   odds that he shall do so  he consequently showeth himself to be   indifferent whether he doeth it or no  or rather that he doth   incline to do it  whence  not caring to be otherwise  or loving to   be a slanderer  he in effect and just esteem is such  having at   least a slanderous heart and inclination   he that puts it to the   venture whether he lieth or no  doth eo ipso lie morally  as   declaring no care or love of truth    thou shalt not   saith the   law   follow a multitude to do evil   and with like reason we should   not follow the multitude in speaking evil of our neighbour         another slanderous course is  to build censures and reproaches   upon slender conjectures  or uncertain suspicions  those  greek     evil surmises  which st  paul condemneth    of these occasion can   never be wanting to them who seek them  or are ready to embrace   them  no innocence  no wisdom can anywise prevent them  and if they   may be admitted as grounds of defamation  no man s good name can be   secure   but he that upon such accounts dareth to asperse his   neighbour is in moral computation no less a slanderer than if he did   the like out of pure invention  or without any ground at all   for   doubtful and false in this case differ little  to devise  and to   divine  in matters of this nature  do import near the same   he that   will judge or speak ill of others  ought to be well assured of what   he thinks or says  he that asserteth that which he doth not know to   be true  doth as well lie as he that affirmeth that which he knoweth   to be false  for he deceiveth the hearers  begetting in them an   opinion that he is assured of what he affirms  especially in dealing   with the concernments of others  whose right and repute justice doth   oblige us to beware of infringing  charity should dispose us to   regard and tender as our own   it is not every possibility  every   seeming  every faint show or glimmering appearance  which sufficeth   to ground bad opinion or reproachful discourse concerning our   brother   the matter should be clear  notorious and palpable  before   we admit a disadvantageous conceit into our head  a distasteful   resentment into our heart  a harsh word into our mouth about him     men may fancy themselves sagacious and shrewd  persons of deep   judgment and fine wit they may be taken for  when they can dive into   others  hearts  and sound their intentions  when through thick mists   or at remote distances they can descry faults in them  when they   collect ill of them by long trains  and subtle fetches of discourse     but in truth they do thereby rather betray in themselves small love   of truth  care of justice  or sense of charity  together with little   wisdom and discretion   for truth is only seen in a clear light    justice requireth strict proof   charity  thinketh no evil   and    believeth all things  for the best  wisdom is not forward to   pronounce before full evidence     he   saith the wise man   that   answereth a matter before he heareth it  it is folly and shame unto   him     in fine  they who proceed thus  as it is usual that they   speak falsely  as it is casual that they ever speak truly  as they   affect to speak ill  true or false  so worthily they are to be   reckoned among slanderers         another like way of slandering is  impetuous or negligent   sputtering out of words  without minding what truth or consequence   there is in them  how they may touch or hurt our neighbour   to   avoid this sin  we must not only be free from intending mischief    but wary of effecting it  not only careful of not wronging one   distinct person  but of harming any promiscuously  not only   abstinent from aiming directly  but provident not to hit casually   any person with obloquy   for as he that dischargeth shot into a   crowd  or so as not to look about regarding who may stand in the   way  is no less guilty of doing mischief  and bound to make   satisfaction to them he woundeth  than if he had aimed at some one   person   so if we sling our bad words at random  which may light   unluckily  and defame somebody  we become slanderers unawares  and   before we think on it   this practice hath not ever all the malice   of the worst slander  but it worketh often the effects thereof  and   therefore doth incur its guilt  and its punishment  especially it   being commonly derived from ill temper  or from bad habit  which we   are bound to watch over  to curb  and to correct   the tongue is a   sharp and perilous weapon  which we are bound to keep up in the   sheath  or never to draw forth but advisedly  and upon just   occasion  it must ever be wielded with caution and care   to   brandish it wantonly  to lay about with it blindly and furiously  to   slash and smite therewith any that happeneth to come in our way    doth argue malice or madness         it is an ordinary way of proceeding to calumniate  for men    reflecting upon some bad disposition in themselves  although   resulting from their own particular temper  from their bad   principles  or from their ill custom   to charge it presently upon   others  presuming others to be like themselves   like the wicked   person in the psalm   thou thoughtest that i was altogether such an   one as thyself    this is to slander mankind first in the gross    then in retail  as occasion serveth  to asperse any man  this is the   way of half witted machiavellians  and of desperate reprobates in   wickedness  who having prostituted their consciences to vice  for   their own defence and solace  would shroud themselves from blame   under the shelter of common pravity and infirmity  accusing all men   of that whereof they know themselves guilty   but surely there can   be no greater iniquity than this  that one man should undergo blame   for the ill conscience of another     these seem to be the chief kinds of slander  and most common ways of   practising it   in which description  the folly thereof doth  i   suppose  so clearly shine  that no man can look thereon without   loathing and despising it  as not only a very ugly  but a most   foolish practice   no man surely can be wise who will suffer himself   to be defiled therewith   but to render its folly more apparent  we   shall display it  declaring it to be extremely foolish upon several   accounts   but the doing of this  in regard to your patience  we   shall forbear at present         the folly of slander         part        he that uttereth slander is a fool    prov  x         i have formerly in this place  discoursing upon this text  explained   the nature of the sin here condemned  with its several kinds and   ways of practising       ii   i shall now proceed to declare the folly of it  and to make   good by divers reasons the assertion of the wise man  that  he who   uttereth slander is a fool          slandering is foolish  as sinful and wicked     all sin is foolish upon many accounts  as proceeding from ignorance    error  inconsiderateness  vanity  as implying weak judgment  and   irrational choice  as thwarting the dictates of reason  and best   rules of wisdom  as producing very mischievous effects to ourselves    bereaving us of the chief goods  and exposing us to the worst evils     what can be more egregiously absurd than to dissent in our opinion   and discord in our choice from infinite wisdom  to provoke by our   actions sovereign justice  and immutable severity   to oppose   almighty power  and offend immense goodness  to render ourselves   unlike and contrary in our doings  our disposition  our state  to   absolute perfection and felicity   what can be more desperately wild   than to disoblige our best friend  to forfeit his love and favour    to render him our enemy  who is our lord and our judge  upon whose   mere will and disposal all our subsistence  all our welfare does   absolutely depend   what greater madness can be conceived than to   deprive our minds of all true content here  and to separate our   souls from eternal bliss hereafter  to gall our consciences now with   sore remorse  and to engage ourselves for ever in remediless   miseries   such folly doth all sin include   whence in scripture   style worthily goodness and wisdom are terms equivalent  sin and   folly do signify the same thing     if thence this practice be proved extremely sinful  it will thence   sufficiently be demonstrated no less foolish   and that it is   extremely sinful may easily be shown   it is the character of the   superlatively wicked man    thou givest thy mouth to evil  and thy   tongue frameth deceit   thou sittest and speakest against thy   brother  thou slanderest thine own mother s son    it is  indeed    plainly the blackest and most hellish sin that can be  that which   giveth the grand fiend his names  and most expresseth his nature     he is  greek   the slanderer   satan  the spiteful adversary  the   old snake or dragon  hissing out lies  and spitting forth venom of   calumnious accusation  the accuser of the brethren  a murderous    envious  malicious calumniator  the father of lies  the grand   defamer of god to man  of man to god  of one man to another   and   highly wicked surely must that practice be  whereby we grow   namesakes to him  conspire in proceeding with him  resemble his   disposition and nature   it is a complication  a comprisal  a   collection and sum of all wickedness  opposite to all the principal   virtues  to veracity and sincerity  to charity and justice     transgressing all the great commandments  violating immediately and   directly all the duties concerning our neighbour     to lie simply is a great fault  being a deviation from that good   rule which prescribeth truth in all our words  rendering us unlike   and disagreeable to god  who is the god of truth  who loveth truth    and practiseth it in all his doings  who abominateth all falsehood     including a treacherous breach of faith towards mankind  we being   all  in order to the maintenance of society  by an implicit compact    obliged by speech to declare our mind  to inform truly  and not to   impose upon our neighbour  arguing pusillanimous timorousness and   impotency of mind  a distrust in god s help  and diffidence in all   good means to compass our designs  begetting deception and error  a   foul and ill favoured brood   lying  i say  is upon such accounts a   sinful and blamable thing  and of all lies those certainly are the   worst which proceed from malice or from vanity  or from both  and   which work mischief  such as slanders are     again  to bear any hatred or ill will  to exercise enmity towards   any man  to design or procure any mischief to our neighbour  whom   even jews were commanded to love as themselves  whose good  by many   laws  and upon divers scores  we are obliged to tender as our own    is a heinous fault  and of this apparently the slanderer is most   guilty in the highest degree   for evidently true it is which the   wise man affirmeth   a lying tongue hateth those that are afflicted   with it   there is no surer argument of extreme hatred  nothing but   the height of ill will can suggest this practice   the slanderer is   an enemy  as the most fierce and outrageous  so the most base and   unworthy that can be  he fighteth with the most perilous and most   unlawful weapon  in the most furious and foul way that can be   his   weapon is an envenomed arrow  full of deadly poison  which he   shooteth suddenly  and feareth not   a weapon which by no force can   be resisted  by no art declined  whose impression is altogether   inevitable and unsustainable   it is a most insidious  most   treacherous and cowardly way of fighting  wherein manifestly the   weakest and basest spirits have extreme advantage  and may easily   prevail against the bravest and worthiest  for no man of honour or   honesty can in way of resistance or requital deign to use it  but   must infallibly without repugnance be borne down thereby   by it the   vile practiser achieveth the greatest mischief that can be   his   words are  as the psalmist saith of doeg  devouring words    thou   lovest all devouring words  o thou deceitful tongue   and   a man     saith the wise man   that beareth false witness against his   neighbour is a maul  and a sword  and a sharp arrow   that is  he is   a complicated instrument of all mischiefs  he smiteth and bruiseth   like a maul  he cutteth and pierceth like a sword  he thus doth hurt   near at hand  and at a distance he woundeth like a sharp arrow  it   is hard anywhere to evade him  or to get out of his reach    many     saith another wise man  the imitator of solomon   have fallen by the   edge of the sword  but not so many as have fallen by the tongue     well is he that is defended from it  and hath not passed through the   venom thereof  who hath not drawn the yoke thereof  nor hath been   bound in its bands   for the yoke thereof is a yoke of iron  and the   bands thereof are bands of brass   the death thereof is an evil   death  the grave were better than it    incurable are the wounds   which the slanderer inflicteth  irreparable the damages which he   causeth  indelible the marks which he leaveth    no balsam can heal   the biting of a sycophant   no thread can stitch up a good name torn   by calumnious defamation  no soap is able to cleanse from the stains   aspersed by a foul mouth   aliquid adhaerebit  somewhat always of   suspicion and ill opinion will stick in the minds of those who have   given ear to slander   so extremely opposite is this practice unto   the queen of virtues  charity   its property indeed is to  believe   all things   that is  all things for the best  and to the advantage   of our neighbour  not so much as to suspect any evil of him without   unavoidably manifest cause  how much more not to devise any   falsehood against him   it  covereth  all things  studiously   conniving at real defects  and concealing assured miscarriages   how   much more not divulging imaginary or false scandals   it disposeth   to seek and further any the least good concerning him   how much   more will it hinder committing grievous outrage upon his dearest   good name     again  all injustice is abominable  to do any sort of wrong is a   heinous crime  that crime which of all most immediately tendeth to   the dissolution of society  and disturbance of human life  which god   therefore doth most loathe  and men have reason especially to   detest   and of this the slanderer is most deeply guilty    a   witness of belial scorneth judgment  and the mouth of the wicked   devoureth iniquity   saith the wise man   he is indeed  according to   just estimation  guilty of all kinds whatever of injury  breaking   all the second table of commands respecting our neighbour   most   formally and directly he  beareth false witness against his   neighbour   he doth  covet his neighbour s goods   for  tis   constantly out of such an irregular desire  for his own presumed   advantage  to dispossess his neighbour of some good  and transfer it   on himself  that the slanderer uttereth his tale   he is ever a   thief and robber of his good name  a deflowerer and defiler of his   reputation  an assassin and murderer of his honour   so doth he   violate all the rules of justice  and perpetrateth all sorts of   wrong against his neighbour     he may  indeed  perhaps conceive it no great matter that he   committeth  because he doth not act in so boisterous and bloody a   way  but only by words  which are subtle  slim  and transient   things   upon his neighbour s credit only  which is no substantial   or visible matter   he draweth  thinks he   no blood  nor breaketh   any bones  nor impresseth any remarkable scar   tis only the soft   air he breaketh with his tongue   tis only a slight character that   he stampeth on the fancy   tis only an imaginary stain that he   daubeth his neighbour with  therefore he supposeth no great wrong   done  and seemeth to himself innocent  or very excusable   but these   conceits arise from great inconsiderateness  or mistake   nor can   they excuse the slanderer from grievous injustice   for in dealing   with our neighbour  and meddling with his property  we are not to   value things according to our fancy  but according to the price set   on them by the owner  we must not reckon that a trifle  which he   prizeth as a jewel   since  then  all men  especially men of honour   and honesty  do  from a necessary instinct of nature  estimate their   good name beyond any of their goods  yea  do commonly hold it more   dear and precious than their very lives  we  by violently or   fraudulently bereaving them of it  do them no less wrong than if we   should rob or cozen them of their substance  yea  than if we should   maim their body  or spill their blood  or even stop their breath     if they as grievously feel it  and resent it as deeply  as they do   any other outrage  the injury is really as great  to them   even the   slanderer s own judgment and conscience might tell him so much  for   they who most slight another s fame  are usually very tender of   their own  and can with no patience endure that others should touch   it  which demonstrates the inconsiderateness of their judgment  and   the iniquity of their practice   it is an injustice not to be   corrected or cured   thefts may be restored  wounds may be cured    but there is no restitution or cure of a lost good name   it is   therefore an irreparable injury     nor is the thing itself  in true judgment  contemptible  but in   itself really very considerable    a good name   saith solomon   himself  no fool    is rather to be chosen than great riches  and   loving favour rather than silver and gold    in its consequences it   is much more so  the chief interests of a man  the success of his   affairs  his ability to do good  for himself  his friends  his   neighbour   his safety  the best comforts and conveniences of his   life  sometimes his life itself  depending thereon  so that whoever   doth snatch or filch it from him  doth not only according to his   opinion  and in moral value  but in real effect commonly rob    sometimes murder  ever exceedingly wrong his neighbour   it is often   the sole reward of a man s virtue and all the fruit of his industry    so that by depriving him of that  he is robbed of all his estate    and left stark naked of all  excepting a good conscience  which is   beyond the reach of the world  and which no malice or misfortune can   divest him of   full then of iniquity  full of uncharitableness    full of all wickedness is this practice  and consequently full it is   of folly   no man  one would think  of any tolerable sense  should   dare or deign to incur the guilt of a practice so vile and base  so   indeed diabolical and detestable   but further more particularly          the slanderer is plainly a fool  because he maketh wrong   judgments and valuations of things  and accordingly driveth on silly   bargains for himself  in result whereof he proveth a great loser     he means by his calumnious stories either to vent some passion   boiling in him  or to compass some design which he affects  or to   please some humour that he is possessed with   but is any of these   things worth purchasing at so dear a rate  can there be any valuable   exchange for our honesty   is it not more advisable to suppress our   passion  or to let it evaporate otherwise  than to discharge it in   so foul a way   is it not better to let go a petty interest  than to   further it by committing so notorious and heinous a sin  to let an   ambitious project sink  than to buoy it up by such base means   is   it not wisdom rather to smother or curb our humour  than by   satisfying it thus to forfeit our innocence   can anything in the   world be so considerable  that for its sake we should defile our   souls by so foul a practice  making shipwreck of a good conscience    abandoning honour and honesty  incurring all the guilt and all the   punishment due to so enormous a crime   is it not far more wisdom    contentedly to see our neighbour to enjoy credit and success  to   flourish and thrive in the world  than by such base courses to sully   his reputation  to rifle him of his goods  to supplant or cross him   in his affairs   we do really  when we think thus to depress him    and to climb up to wealth or credit by the ruins of his honour  but   debase ourselves   whatever comes of it  whether he succeeds or is   disappointed therein  assuredly he that useth such courses will   himself be the greatest loser  and deepest sufferer    tis true   which the wise man saith   the getting of treasures by a lying   tongue  is a vanity tossed to and fro of them that seek death      and   woe unto them   saith the prophet   that draw iniquity with   cords of vanity   that is  who by falsehood endeavour to compass   unjust designs     but it is not  perhaps he will pretend  to assuage a private   passion  or to promote his particular concernment  that he makes so   bold with his neighbour  or deals so harshly with him  but for the   sake of orthodox doctrine  for advantage of the true church  for the   advancement of public good  he judgeth it expedient to asperse him     this indeed is the covert of innumerable slanders   zeal for some   opinion  or some party  beareth out men of sectarian and factious   spirits in such practices  they may do  they may say anything for   those fine ends   what is a little truth  what is any man s   reputation in comparison to the carrying on such brave designs   but    to omit that men do usually prevaricate in these cases  that it is   not commonly for love of truth  but of themselves  not so much for   the benefit of their sect  but for their own interest  that they   calumniate  this plea will nowise justify such practice   for truth   and sincerity  equity and candour  meekness and charity are   inviolably to be observed  not only towards dissenters in opinion    but even towards declared enemies of truth itself  we are to bless   them  that is  to speak well of them  and to wish well to them   not   to curse them  that is  not to reproach them  or to wish them ill    much less to belie them    truth also  as it cannot ever need  so   doth it always loathe and scorn the patronage and the succour of   lies  it is able to support and protect itself by fair means  it   will not be killed upon a pretence of saving it  or thrive by its   own ruin   nor indeed can any party be so much strengthened and   underpropped  as it will be weakened and undermined by such courses     no cause can stand firm upon a bottom so loose and slippery as   falsehood is   all the good a slanderer can do is  to disparage what   he would maintain   in truth  no heresy can be worse than that would   be which should allow to play the devil in any case   he that can   dispense with himself to slander a jew or a turk  doth in so doing   render himself worse than either of them by profession is   for even   they  and even pagans themselves  disallow the practice of   inhumanity and iniquity   all men by light of nature avow truth to   be honourable  and faith to be indispensably observed   he doth not   understand what it is to be christian  or careth not to practise   according thereto  who can find in his heart in any case  upon any   pretence  to calumniate   in fine  to prostitute our conscience  or   sacrifice our honesty  for any cause  to any interest whatever  can   never be warrantable or wise   further          the slanderer is a fool  because he useth improper means and   preposterous methods of effecting his purposes   as there is no   design worth the carrying on by ways of falsehood and iniquity  so   is there scarce any  no good or lawful one at least  which may not   more surely  more safely  more cleverly be achieved by means of   truth and justice   is not always the straight way more short than   the oblique and crooked  is not the plain way more easy than the   rough and cragged  is not the fair way more pleasant and passable   than the foul   is it not better to walk in paths that are open and   allowed  than in those that are shut up and prohibited  than to   clamber over walls  to break through fences  to trespass upon   enclosures   surely yes    he that walketh uprightly  walketh   surely    using strict veracity and integrity  candour and equity    is the best method of accomplishing good designs   our own industry    good use of the parts and faculties god hath given us  embracing   fair opportunities  god s blessing and providence  are sufficient   means to rely upon for procuring  in an honest way  whatever is   convenient for us   these are ways approved  and amiable to all men    they procure the best friends  and fewest enemies  they afford to   the practises a cheerful courage  and good hope  they meet with less   disappointment  and have no regret or shame attending them   he that   hath recourse to the other base means  and  maketh lies his refuge     as he renounceth all just and honest means  as he disclaimeth all   hope in god s assistance  and forfeiteth all pretence to his   blessing   so he cannot reasonably expect good success  or be   satisfied in any undertaking   the supplanting way indeed seems the   most curt and compendious way of bringing about dishonest or   dishonourable designs   but as good design is certainly dishonoured   thereby  so is it apt thence to be defeated  it raises up enemies   and obstacles  yielding advantages to whoever is disposed to cross   us   as in trade it is notorious that the best course to thrive is   by dealing squarely and truly  any fraud or cozenage appearing there   doth overthrow a man s credit  and drive away custom from him   so   in all other transactions  as he that dealeth justly and fairly will   have his affairs proceed roundly  and shall find men ready to comply   with him  so he that is observed to practise falsehood will be   declined by some  opposed by others  disliked by all   no man scarce   willingly will have to do with him  he is commonly forced to stand   out in business  as one that plays foul play         lastly  the slanderer is a very fool  as bringing many great   inconveniences  troubles  and mischiefs on himself     first   a fool s mouth   saith the wise man   is his destruction    his lips are the snare of his soul   and if any kind of speech is   destructive and dangerous  then is this certainly most of all  for   by no means can a man inflame so fierce anger  impress so stiff   hatred  raise so deadly enmity against himself  and consequently so   endanger his safety  ease and welfare  as by this practice   men can   more easily endure  and sooner will forgive  any sort of abuse than   this  they will rather pardon a robber of their goods  than a   defamer of their good name     secondly  such an one indeed is not only odious to the person   immediately concerned  but generally to all men that observe his   practice  every man presently will be sensible how easily it may be   his own case  how liable he may be to be thus abused  in a way   against which there is no guard or defence   the slanderer therefore   is apprehended a common enemy  dangerous to all men  and thence   rendereth all men averse from him  and ready to cross him   love and   peace  tranquillity and security can only be maintained by innocent   and true dealing   so the psalmist hath well taught us    what man   is he that desireth life  and loveth many days  that he may see   good   keep thy tongue from evil  and thy lips from speaking guile      thirdly  all wise  all noble  all ingenuous and honest persons have   an aversion from this practice  and cannot entertain it with any   acceptance or complacence    a righteous man hateth lying   saith   the wise man   it is only ill natured and ill nurtured  unworthy and   naughty people that are willing auditors or encouragers thereof    a   wicked doer   saith the wise man again   giveth heed to false lips    and a liar giveth ear to a naughty tongue    all love of truth and   regard to justice  and sense of humanity  all generosity and   ingenuity  all charity and good will to men  must be extinct in   those who can with delight  or indeed with patience  lend an ear or   give any countenance to a slanderer   and is not he a very fool who   chooseth to displease the best  only soothing the worst of men     fourthly  the slanderer indeed doth banish himself from all   conversation and company  or intruding into it becomes very   disgustful thereto  for he worthily is not only looked upon as an   enemy to those whom he slandereth  but to those also upon whom he   obtrudeth his calumnious discourse   he not only wrongeth the former   by the injury  but he mocketh the latter by the falsehood of his   stories  implicitly charging his hearers with weakness and   credulity  or with injustice and pravity     fifthly  he also derogateth wholly from his own credit in all   matters of discourse   for he that dareth thus to injure his   neighbour  who can trust him in anything he speaks  what will not he   say to please his vile humour  or further his base interest  what    thinks any man  will he scruple or boggle at  who hath the heart in   thus doing wrong and mischief to imitate the devil   further      sixthly  this practice is perpetually haunted with most troublesome   companions  inward regret and self condemnation  fear and disquiet     the conscience of dealing so unworthily doth smite and rack him  he   is ever in danger  and thence in fear to be discovered  and requited   for it   of these passions the manner of his behaviour is a manifest   indication   for men do seldom vent their slanderous reports openly   and loudly  to the face or in the ear of those who are concerned in   them  but do utter them in a low voice  in dark corners  out of   sight and hearing  where they conceit themselves at present safe   from being called to an account    swords   saith the psalmist of   such persons   are in their lips   who  say they  doth hear    and     whoso privily slandereth his neighbour  him will i cut off   saith   david again  intimating the common manner of this practice   calumny   is like  the plague  that walketh in darkness    hence appositely   are the practisers thereof termed whisperers and backbiters   their   heart suffers them not openly to avow  their conscience tells them   they cannot fairly defend their practice   again      seventhly  the consequence of this practice is commonly shameful   disgrace  with an obligation to retract and render satisfaction     for seldom doth calumny pass long without being detected and   confuted    he that walketh uprightly  walketh surely   but he that   perverteth his ways shall be known   and   the lip of truth shall be   established for ever  but a lying lip is but for a moment   saith   the great observer of things   and when the slander is disclosed    the slanderer is obliged to excuse  that is  to palliate one lie   with another  if he can do it   or forced to recant  with much   disgrace and extreme displeasure to himself   he is also many times   constrained  with his loss and pain  to repair the mischief he hath   done     eighthly  to this in likelihood the concernments of men  and the   powers which guard justice  will forcibly bring him  and certainly   his conscience will bind him thereto  god will indispensably exact   it from him   he can never have any sound quiet in his mind  he can   never expect pardon from heaven  without acknowledging his fault    repairing the wrong he hath done  restoring that good name of which   he dispossessed his neighbour   for in this no less than in other   cases conscience cannot be satisfied  remission will not be granted    except due restitution be performed  and of all restitutions this   surely is the most difficult  most laborious  and most troublesome      tis nowise so hard to restore goods stolen or extorted  as to   recover a good opinion lost  to wipe off aspersions cast on a man s   name  to cure a wounded reputation   the most earnest and diligent   endeavour can hardly ever effect this  or spread the plaster so far   as the sore hath reached   the slanderer therefore doth engage   himself into great straits  incurring an obligation to repair an   almost irreparable mischief     ninthly  this practice doth also certainly revenge itself  imposing   on its actor a perfect retaliation   a tooth for a tooth   an   irrecoverable infamy to himself  for the infamy he causeth to   others   who will regard his fame  who will be concerned to excuse   his faults  who so outrageously abuseth the reputation of others     he suffereth justly  he is paid in his own coin  will any man think    who doth hear him reproached     tenthly  in fine  the slanderer  if he doth not  by serious and sore   repentance retract his practice  doth banish himself from heaven and   happiness  doth expose himself to endless miseries and sorrows     for  if none that  maketh a lie shall enter into the heavenly city     if without those mansions of joy and bliss  every one  must   eternally abide  that loveth or maketh a lie   if  greek    to all   liars their portion  is assigned  in the lake which burneth with   fire and brimstone   then assuredly the capital liar  the slanderer    who lieth most injuriously and mischievously  shall be far excluded   from felicity  and thrust down into the depth of that miserable   place   if  as st  paul saith  no  railer   or evil speaker   shall   inherit the kingdom of god   how far thence shall they be removed   who without any truth or justice do speak ill of and reproach their   neighbour   if for every  greek    idle   or vain   word  we must    render a  strict  account   how much more shall we be severely   reckoned with for this sort of words  so empty of truth and void of   equity   words that are not only negatively vain  or useless  but   positively vain  as false and spoken to bad purpose   if slander   perhaps here may evade detection  or escape deserved punishment  yet   infallibly hereafter  at the dreadful day  it shall be disclosed    irreversibly condemned  inevitably persecuted with condign reward of   utter shame and sorrow     is not he then  he who  out of malignity  or vanity  to serve any   design  or soothe any humour in himself or others  doth by   committing this sin involve himself in all these great evils  both   here and hereafter  a most desperate and deplorable fool     having thus described the nature of this sin  and declared the folly   thereof  we need  i suppose  to say no more for dissuading it    especially to persons of a generous and honest mind  who cannot but   scorn to debase and defile themselves by so mean and vile a   practice  or to those who seriously do profess christianity  that   is  the religion which peculiarly above all others prescribeth   constant truth  strictest justice  and highest charity     i shall only add  that since our faculty of speech  wherein we do   excel all other creatures  was given us  as in the first place to   praise and glorify our maker  so in the next to benefit and help our   neighbour  as an instrument of mutual succour and delectation  of   friendly commerce and pleasant converse together  for instructing   and advising  comforting and cheering one another   it is an   unnatural perverting  and an irrational abuse thereof  to employ it   to the damage  disgrace  vexation  or wrong in any kind of our   brother   better indeed had we been as brutes without its use  than   we are  if so worse than brutishly we abuse it     finally  all these things being considered  we may  i think    reasonably conclude it most evidently true that  he which uttereth   slander is a fool               boat didn t have any power  and it wouldn t even  drift right on account of being almost square  westy martin said it was  on the square  all right  he s a crazy kid  that fellow is  anyway  the  boat didn t have any power  our scoutmaster  mr  ellsworth  said it  didn t even have any will power  we couldn t even pole it     when we first got it  it was way up a creek in the marshes and mr   donnelle  he s the man that owned it  took us there and showed it to  us  just as we were coming near it  a fellow jumped out of it and ran  away through the marshes  we said he must be a tramp  because he was  all ragged  anyway  he acted as if he was scared  that was one sure  thing      we should worry about him  anyway   i said  and mr  donnelle said he  was gone and that was the end of him     but  believe me  that wasn t the end of him  that was only the  beginning of him  i didn t say anything more about him before  because  i didn t know  but believe me  that fellow was  what do you call it    you know   destined   to cause a lot of trouble in our young lives   that sounds like a regular author  hey   destined      when we began fixing the boat up  we found that one of the lockers was  locked with a padlock and as long as the boat didn t belong to us  we  didn t break it open  especially because there were plenty of lockers  besides that one  i bet you d like to know what was in that locker  but  you re not going to find that out yet  so there s no use asking  all  the time we thought mr  donnelle had the key to it  but  oh  just you  wait     well  after we got it all fixed up  we couldn t decide how we d get it  down into the bay and then up the hudson to catskill landing  that s  where you have to go to get to temple camp  temple camp is a great big  scout camp and it s right on the shore of black lake  oh  it s peachy   you ll see it  all right  and you ll see jeb rushmore  he s camp  manager  he used to be a trapper out west  you ll see us all around  camp fire  you wait  mr  ellsworth says this story is all right so far   only to go on about the boat  gee  i ll go faster than the boat did   that s one sure thing  leave it to me  but after we got down into the  hudson we went fast  all right  let s see where was i     oh  yes  we were wondering how we d get to camp in it because we didn t  have much money in our troop  on account of being broke  poor  but  honest  hey  and it costs a lot of money to be towed and an engine  would cost a hundred and fifty dollars  nix on the engine  you can bet   but  oh  boy  there s one thing mr  ellsworth said and it s true  i ve  got to admit that  he said that good turns are good investments  he  says they pay a hundred percent  that s even better than liberty bonds   you don t get it back in money  but you get it back in fun  what s the  difference     well  we did a good turn  and oh  believe me  there was  some  come  back     one day a tug came up our river on its way up to north bridgeboro   that s where the mill is  and there wasn t anybody there to open the  bridge so it could get through  oh  wasn t that old tug captain mad  he  kept whistling and whistling and saying things about the river being an  old mud hole  and how he d never get down the bay again  unless he  could get through and come down on the full tide  oh  boy  but he was  wild     when we told him that old uncle jimmy  the bridge tender  had sneaked  away to a grand army convention  he kind of cooled down on account of  being an old veteran himself  and then some of us fellows fished up an  old key bar that had been lost in the river and opened the bridge with  it  that s what they call the thing you open the bridge with  a  key bar  it s like a crow bar only different     i m not saying that was so much of a good turn  except it was turning  the bridge around and connie bennett said that was a good turn  he s  the troop cut up  anyway  old captain savage took me up to north  bridgeboro with him and first i was kind of scared of him  because he  had a big red face and he was awful gruff  but wait till you hear about  the fun we had with him when we landed and took a peek at peekskill   oh  boy     then he said how he liked the way we stood up for uncle jimmy  and i  guess besides he was glad about me diving and getting the key bar  but  anyway  that was easy  so he said he was going to tow us up as far as  poughkeepsie the next saturday  and that if we refused on account of  scouts not being willing to accept anything for a service  he d make a  lot of trouble for uncle jimmy  because he was away  he was only  fooling when he said that  maybe you won t like him in the beginning   but you ll get to like him pretty soon     so that s how we got it all fixed to go to camp  or part of the way  anyway  in the house boat  and believe me  we had some trip  and that s  mostly what i m going to tell you all about  talk about fun     on saturday morning all of the troop came down to the house boat ready  for the trip  and oh  you ought to have seen skinny mccord  he s a  little fellow that lives down in the poor part of town  and he was a  new member  his mother is poor and she goes out washing  and skinny was  sick and his clothes were all in rags  and even he didn t have any  shoes and stockings  but  anyway  he did me a good turn and so westy  martin and i got him into the troop  and we presented him to the elk  patrol  because they had a vacant place on account of tom slade being  away in france  so now you know about skinny and you ll find out a lot  more about him  too     before saturday came  mr  ellsworth made a bargain with sandy grober to  tow us down into the kill von kull  that s near staten island  you  know  sandy has a boat with a heavy duty motor in it  and he said he d  do the job for ten dollars  because  anyway  he d go to princess bay  fishing  our troop was broke and we couldn t spare the money  because  we needed all we had for eats and things  so this is the way we fixed  it     mr  ellsworth gave sandy the ten dollars and then each one of the  patrol leaders gave mr  ellsworth a note saying his patrol would pay  back two dollars and a half as soon as they earned it  that would make  seven dollars and a half  and mr  ellsworth said he would pay the other  two fifty himself  so you see it was all divided up even between the  patrols and the scoutmaster     believe me  we had some fun earning that money  especially the raving  ravens  that s the raven patrol  you know     we started early saturday morning  and we knew just where we had to go   because we had a letter from captain savage  saying that we should wait  in the anchorage off st  george at staten island  until he came and got  us  he said maybe it would be sunday night or maybe monday morning  but  anyway  just to ride on our anchor till he came     we didn t have any adventures going down our river and i won t bother  telling you about it  because it would only be slow  gee  williger  a  story that s being towed against the tide wouldn t have much action   would it  i bet you d skip  so it s better for  me  to skip than for   you   hey     but anyway  on the way down we got the boat all straightened out inside  and decided just how we d sleep  two patrols would sleep in the two  rooms and one patrol on deck under the awning  and we decided we d take  turns that way  so each patrol would get some sleeping outdoors     we didn t get to the kill von kull till about five o clock and i guess  it was about six o clock when we got to st  george  oh  but there are  some peachy boats in the anchorage there  regular yachts and big cabin  cruisers  and that s where our adventures began  you can bet  do you  like mysteries  gee  that s one thing i m crazy about  mysteries    mysteries and pineapple sodas  oh  oh     then sandy left us and went off to catch cash on delivery fish  that s  cod fish  oh  boy  but it was fine rocking away out there  pretty soon  i got supper because i m cook  i know how to make flapjacks and  hunters  stew  and a lot of things  after supper the fellows decided to  go ashore to st  george and get some sodas and take in a movie show  i  said i d stay on the houseboat because i had to write up the  troop book  maybe i forgot to tell you that i m troop historian  most of  the things in this story are out of our troop book     you d better not skip the next chapter  because something is going to  happen         chapter ii    tells you how i had a visitor    we weren t anchored very far from shore  so it didn t take long for all  the troop to row over  even though we only had one small boat  mr   ellsworth went with them so he could look after skinny     as soon as i had finished clearing up after supper  i got out the troop  book and began writing it up  i was behind about two weeks with it and  so i had about ten pages to do  oh  but it was dandy sitting there on  the deck with my feet up on the railing  writing  i mean i was writing  with my hand  pretty soon it began getting dark and i could see the  lights coming out on all the different boats just like stars  it s kind  of fun being alone sometimes  i could see all the lights in the town   too  but what did i care  i said i d rather be alone where i was   pretty soon it was too dark to write and so i just sat there thinking   maybe you think it s no fun just thinking  but i was thinking how  pretty soon we d be hiking up from catskill landing to black lake  and  how i d see jeb rushmore  and how i d take a hike and find out if the  robin s nest was just where it was last year  that robin is a member of  our patrol  he s an honorary member     all of a sudden i saw it was pitch dark and i couldn t see any boats at  all  only lights  moving a little on account of the boats rocking     in a little while i heard oars splashing and the sound seemed to be  coming nearer and nearer  so i knew it was the first boat load of  fellows coming back  i thought it was awful soon for them to be getting  back  it seemed funny that they weren t talking  especially if it was  the raving ravens  that s what we call the raven patrol  because  pee wee harris would be sure to be running on high  that s the way he  always does  especially coming home from the movies  and if it was the  elk patrol i d be sure to hear bert mcalpin because he s a human  victrola record     pretty soon i could make out a black spot coming nearer and then i knew  for sure it was headed for the house boat  but there wasn t any sound  except the splashing of the oars and i thought that was mighty funny   in a couple of minutes the boat came alongside and i heard someone say     pst   very quiet like  i went and looked over the rail and there i  saw a fellow all alone in a rowboat  i couldn t see him very well  but  i could see he had on an old hat and was pretty shabby     then he sort of whispered   anybody up there  skeezeks      i told him no  and asked him who he was and what he wanted  but he  didn t say anything  only tied his boat  and climbed up over the rail   then i could see him better by the light shining through the cabin  window  and his clothes were all ragged and greasy  he looked pretty  tough  but one thing  anyway  he smiled an awful nice kind of a smile  and hit me a whack on the shoulder and said   don t get excited   skeezeks  you re all right and i won t hurt you  how are you  anyway      i told him i was very well  but i d like for him please to tell me who  he was  so i d know     then he gave me another push  and i don t know  there was something  about him that kind of made me like him  and i wasn t scared of him at  all      don t you know who i am   he said      i kind of think maybe you re the fellow that jumped out of this boat  and ran away  when it was up the creek near little valley  you look  kind of like him       right the first time   he said   and i bet you re a bully little  scout  what do you say   then he looked out over the water to be sure  nobody was coming      i m a first class scout  and i ve got nine merit badges  and i m a  patrol leader   i told him   anyway i d like to know what you want  here        patrol leader  no    he said  and i could see he was only trying to  get on the right side of me  and that he didn t know what a patrol  leader is at all      can patrol leaders keep secrets   he said     i told him if it was a good secret  they could  then he hit me a good  whack on the shoulder and he winked at me awful funny and said         they are fools who go and tell        wisely has the poet sung       man may hold all sorts of jobs        if he ll only hold his tongue      are you a tramp   i asked him       a tramp    he said   that s pretty good  i dare say i look like one      then he jumped up on the railing and began laughing so hard i was  afraid he d fall backwards into the water  i told him he d better look  out  but he only laughed more  and said i was a great kid  then all of  a sudden he happened to think and he looked around to see if anyone was  coming  then he said      are you game to help me in a dark plot      gee  i didn t know what to tell him   it depends upon how dark it is    i said  because  jiminy  i wanted to be careful and watch my step  but  that only made him laugh a lot  then he said      well  it isn t exactly a black plot  but it s a kind of a dark brown       one thing sure   i said   you re not a tramp  i know that  i can  tell       you re a wise little gazabo   he said   would you really like to know  who i am      i told him sure i would      do you think i look like a tramp   he asked me      i think you kind of look like one   i said   but you don t act like  one  and you don t laugh like one       i ve got blamed little reason to laugh   he said   because i m in  dutch  and you ve got to do me a good turn  will you       good turns are our middle names   i told him   but anyway  i d like to  know who you are  that s sure      then he said   i m lieutenant donnelle  mr  donnelle s son  and i guess  i had a right to run away from the boat  didn t i       g o o d night   i said         chapter iii    tells how i made a promise    then he said   were you one of the kids who were coming along with my  father when i jumped out of the boat   and i told him yes  then he  said   you don t think he saw me  do you   i said   yes  he saw you   but i guess he didn t know who you were  he didn t see your face   that s sure       thank goodness for that   he said   because i ve caused the old gent a  lot of trouble       anyway   i told him   i don t see why you don t wear your uniform   gee  if i had a lieutenant s uniform you bet i d wear it       would you   he said  and he began to laugh  then he said   well  now   let s sit down here on this bench and i ll tell you what  you re  going  to do  and then i ll tell you what  i m  going to do  and we ll have to  be quick about it   then he looked out over the water and listened and  as soon as he was sure nobody was coming  he put his arm over my  shoulder and made me sit down on the bench beside him  i have to admit  i kind of liked that fellow  even though i kind of thought he was  you  know  wild  sort of  it seemed as if he was the kind of a fellow to  have a lot of adventures and to be reckless and all that      maybe you can tell me what you re going to do   i told him   but you  can t tell me what  i m  going to do  that s one sure thing       oh  yes i can   he said   because you re a bully kid and you re an a    sport  and you and i are going to be pals  what do you say       i can t deny that i like you   i said   and i bet you ve been to a lot  of places       france  russia  south america  panama and montclair  new jersey   he  said   and bronx park   gee  i didn t know how to take him  he was so  funny      ever been up in an airplane   he said      cracky  i d like to   i told him      i went from paris to the channel in an airplane   he said     then he gave me a crack on the back and he put his arm around my  shoulder awful nice and friendly like  and it made me kind of proud  because i knew him      now  you listen here   he said   i m in a dickens of a fix  you live  in bridgeboro  do you know jake holden       sure i know him  he s a fisherman   i said   the very same night your  father told us we could use this boat i saw him  and the next day i  went to try to find him for a certain reason  and he was gone away down  the bay after fish  he taught me how to fry eels       get out   he said   really       honest  he did   i told him      well  some day i ll show you how to cook bear s meat  there s  something you don t know       did you ever cook bear s meat   i asked him      surest thing you know   he said   black bears  gray bears  grisly  bears        jiminy   i said     then he went on and this is what he told me  keeping his arm around my  shoulder and every minute or so listening and looking out over the  water   here s something you didn t know   he said  gee  i can remember  every word almost  because you bet i listened  a fellow couldn t help  listening to him  he said   when jake holden went down the bay  your  uncle dudley was with him      i said   you mean you       i mean  me    he said   i was home from camp dix on a short leave and  was on my way to see the old gent and the rest of the folks  when who  should i run plunk into but that old water rat  it was five o clock in  the morning  and i was just taking a hop  skip and a jump off the  train   come on down the bay fishing   he says   what  in these togs    i told him   i ll get  em all greased up and what ll uncle sam say     go home and get some old ones   he said    gainst the rules   i said    can t be running around in civilized clothes    you should worry about  civilized clothes   he said   go up to your dad s old house boat in the  marshes and get some fishin  duds on  the locker s full of  em    thou  hast said something   i told him   go and get your old scow ready and  i m with you       then he hit me a good rap on the shoulder and said   so you see how it  was  kiddo  instead of going home to hear how handsome i looked  i just  beat it up that creek and fished this suit of greasy rags out of one of  the lockers  there was a key in the padlock and i just took off my  uniform and stuffed it in the locker and beat it over to little landing  in bridgeboro       you locked the padlock and took the key  didn t you   i said      righto   he said   and i thought i d be back that same night and down  to dix again by morning  see  but instead of that  here i am and blamed  near a week gone by and uncle sam on the hunt for me  a nice pickle i m  in  what do you say       gee  i wouldn t want to be you   i said   anyway  i m sorry for you   but i don t see why you didn t go back like you said   then he went  over to the railing and looked all around in a hurry      i guess they won t be back for an hour yet   i told him   they went to  the movies      so he came back and sat down beside me again and began talking very  excited  as if i was kind of a friend of his  the way he talked  you  know what i mean  and  cracky  any fellow would be glad to be a friend  of his  that s sure  even if he  was  kind of reckless and  you know     he said   i had so many adventures  old top  that i couldn t tell  em  to you  jakey and i have robinson crusoe tearing his hair from  jealousy  kiddo  this last week has been a whole sea story  in itself    just one hair s breadth escape after another  ever read  treasure  island         did i    i said     then he said   well  treasure island  is like a church social compared  to what i ve been through  some day i m going to tell you about it      i said   i wish you d tell me now       some night around the camp fire i ll tell you   he said   we were  fishing off sea gate and the fish just stood on line waiting for a  chance to bite  we sold three boatfuls in the one day and whacked up  about seventy dollars  what do you think of that  then we chugged  around into coney for gas and on the way back we got mussed up with the  tide and were carried out to sea  banged around for three days  bailing  and trying to fry fish on the muffler  on the fourth day we were picked  up by a fishing schooner about fifty miles off rockaway and towed in  i  said to jakey  i m mike corby  remember that  and if you give your  right name i ll kill you  you ve got to protect me   i said   because  i m in bad   you see how it was  kiddo  i was three days overdue at  camp and didn t even have my uniform  i was so tired bailing and  standing lookout that when they set us down on the wharf at rockaway  i  could have slept standing on my head  and i ve gone without sleep fifty  hours at a stretch on the west front in france  would you believe it       sure  i believe it   i told him      i ll tell you the whole business some day when you and i are on the  hike      i said   cracky  you can bet i d like to go on a hike with you       that s what we will   he said   and we ll swap adventures      i told him i didn t have any good ones like he had to swap  but anyway   i was glad he got home all right       all right    he said   you mean all  wrong   maybe you saw the  accounts in the papers of the two fishermen who were picked up after a   harrowing experience   mike corby and dan mccann  that was us  i left  jakey down at rockaway to wait for his engine to be fixed and beat it  out to jersey   no house boat   was i up in the air  didn t even dare  to go up to the house and ask about it  that rotten little newspaper in  bridgeboro had a big headliner about me disappearing    never seen  after leaving camp dix  whereabouts a mystery    that s what it said     son of professor donnelle    what d you think of that      i told him i was mighty sorry for him  and i was  too     then he said how he went to new york in those old rags  and tried not  to see anybody he knew and even he hid his face when he saw mr  cooper  on the train  and then he telephoned out to bridgeboro and little  valley and made believe he was somebody else  and said he heard the  houseboat was for sale and in that way he found out about his father  loaning it to our troop  and how we were probably anchored near st   george at staten island  oh  boy  didn t he hurry up to get there   because he was afraid we might be gone     so then he waited till night and he was just wondering whether it would  be safe to wait till we were all asleep and then sneak onto the boat   when all of a sudden he saw the fellows coming ashore and he got near  and listened and he heard them speak about going to the movies  and he  heard one fellow say something about how roy would be sorry he didn t  come  and do you want to know what he told me  this is just what he  said  he said   when i heard your name was roy  i knew you d be all  right  see  because look at rob roy   he said   wasn t he a bully hero  and a good scout and a fellow you could trust with a secret  wasn t  he   that s just what he said   you take a fellow named roy   he said    and you ll always find him true and loyal   he said there was a fellow  named roy on the west front and he gave up his life before he d tell on  a comrade     then he said   you see how it is with me  skeezeks  i m in a peck of  trouble and i ve got to get those army duds on and toddle back to camp  as soon as i can get there and face the music  i ve got to make an  excuse  i ve got to get that blamed uniform pressed somehow  i suppose  it s creased from the dampness in that locker  i ve got to straighten  matters out if i can  i just managed to save my life  and by heck  i ll  be lucky if i can just save my honor and that s the plain truth       so you see i ve got a lot to do   he said   and you ve got just the  one thing to do  and that s a cinch  it s to keep your mouth shut  see   suppose the old gent knew about this  suppose my sister knew i was  within a quarter of a mile of the house and didn t go to see them  you  know what girls are      i told him   sure  because i ve got two sisters  and i bet they d like  you  too  i bet they d say you were good looking   then he began to  laugh and he said   well  i bet i d like them too  if they re anything  like you  so now will you keep your mouth shut  ever hear of the  scouts  oath  the indian scouts  oath  i mean  loyalty for better or  worser  don t say i was here  don t say you know anything about me   keep your mouth shut  if my name should be mentioned  keep still  you  don t know anything  nobody was here  see      i said   suppose mr  ellsworth or somebody should ask me       who s going to ask you   he said   you say nothing and they ll say  nothing  i fought for my country  kiddo  and i ve got two wounds  you  don t want to spoil it all for me now  do you      i said   i bet you re brave  anyhow       i d rather face two german divisions than what i ve got to face  to morrow   he said   but if i know it s all right at this end  i won t  worry  are you straight       i wouldn t tell   i told him   cracky  why should  i  tell  and i can  see you ve got a lot of trouble and you re not exactly all to blame   anyway  only i hope i ll see you again sometime because  anyway   whatever you did i kind of like you  it s one of our laws that a fellow  has to be loyal  only sometime will you tell me some of the things you  did  i mean your adventures       i ll tell you all about the jungles and the man eating apes down in  central america   he said     so then he went into the cabin in a big hurry and he took the key out  of his pocket and he opened the locker and took out his uniform  it was  all wrinkled and damp  but anyway  he looked fine in it  you can bet   after he got it all on and fixed right  he stuffed his old clothes into  the place and locked it up again  i bet any girl would say he looked  fine  that s one thing sure     just before he climbed over the railing he put his hand in his pocket  and took out some change and he was in such a hurry that he dropped  some of it and it went all over the deck  i started to pick it up for  him  but he only said   never mind  let it go  you can have all you  find  and here s a quarter to get a couple of sodas      i said   we don t take anything for a service  scouts don t       well  you can have a soda on me  can t you   he said  trying to make  me take the quarter      if you want me to be loyal to you  i have to be loyal if i make a  promise  don t i   i said     he said   what promise      and i said   i can t take anything for a service      then he hit me a rap on the shoulder and laughed and he punched me in  the chest  not hard  only kind of as if to show me that he liked me   then he said   bully for you  kiddo  you re one little trump   then   all of a sudden he was gone     sometimes you can t tell just why you like a fellow  but  anyway  i  liked him just the same         chapter iv    tells about the paper i found    one thing  i bet it was pee wee harris that the lieutenant heard  talking  while he was hiding on shore  anyway  it was pee wee that i  heard first when they were on their way back  that s sure  you know how  plain you can hear voices on the water  and believe me  before those  fellows were half way out i knew all about the bandit of red hallow   that was the fellow in the movies  i suppose  and he must have been  some bandit  because he saved a school teacher from about twenty other  bandits  and shot them all  i guess everybody was shooting pistols at  everybody else  like they mostly do in the movies  pee wee was sticking  up for the poor school teacher  and it made me laugh because he hasn t  got much use for school teachers on account of they re always keeping  him in for talking  anyway  what fun is there in everybody shooting  pistols at each other  me for stalking  that s what  i  say     when mr  ellsworth came on board he said   well  roy  alone in your  glory  eh   i didn t say anything and i hoped he wouldn t ask me any  questions  because anyway  i wasn t going to lie  that s one sure  thing  i asked him how the fellows liked the movies and he said   everybody got shot so they were all satisfied  he was just joking  he  asked the fellows if they d like to meet a lot of bandits in real life   and they said    good night   no   and then he said it was funny how  they liked to meet them in the movies and all the fellows had to admit  it was crazy  you wouldn t catch mr  ellsworth stopping us from going  to the movies  but he always makes us feel silly afterward     pretty soon grove bronson  who is one of the raving ravens  came up to  me and gave me a newspaper with a whole lot of ears of corn in it  and  said we were going to have it for sunday dinner     pee wee said   they re dandy big ears all right  and here s some cans  of tongue       good night   i told him   i thought we had tongue enough with you  here   oh  you ought to have seen little skinny mccord laugh  his face  was all thin on account of his not being very strong and he never had  much food until he got in with us  either  but it was fun to see him  laugh whenever we got back at pee wee      there s some heads of cabbage  too   he said   doc s got them       heads and ears and tongues   i said   you ought to have brought some  potatoes  so we d have eyes   he thinks i m funny  but i just say those  things to make him laugh  so as he ll feel good     then i took all the stuff into the galley and put it in the food  locker  i was just crunching up the newspaper that they brought the  corn in  and was going to throw it out of the window  when i saw a  heading that read   fishermen have harrowing adventure   oh  boy   didn t i sit down on the barrel and read that article through  first  i  looked to see the date of the paper and i saw it was a couple of days  old  after i read that article i cut it out  because i knew i was going  to tell you about all these things  so here it is now for you to read         fishermen have harrowing adventure        the fishing schooner stella b arrived in      port to day with two castaways  who had      drifted for three days in an open boat in the      stormy waters off rockaway  the two      men  mike corby and dan mccann  hail      from jersey  and were carried out to sea in      their twenty two foot launch from about      a mile south of sea gate  where they were      fishing         their engine broke down and their small      boat  beaten by the waves  was leaking      rapidly when they were picked up  one of      the men was unconscious from lack of      nourishment and the other in a state of      utter exhaustion from bailing  in an all but      futile effort to keep the frail little craft      above water  after being resuscitated  one      of the men gave a vague account of having      encountered a waterlogged life boat containing      several people who had perished      from exposure  and of certain papers and      possessions found on one of them         later when a reporter made an effort to      see the men for confirmation of this statement       neither could be found  both are      said to have carried considerable money on      their persons  but this was explained by the      exceptionally large catches of fish which      they sold  during their fishing trip  no      means of tracing them is known since the      boat  in which one of them resumed his      journey home after repairs  had no license      number     maybe you think i didn t read that article twice  and it made me wonder  a lot of things about that fishing trip  one thing  it looked as if  they might have had more adventures than lieutenant donnelle had told  me about  and maybe he didn t want to tell me everything  that s what i  thought  anyway  he didn t say anything about a life boat  that s sure   but maybe he forgot to     just the same i wondered if maybe he had any other reason for being in  such a hurry and so excited  kind of  then i remembered how he said he  would tell me all about it some day  anyway  i said  he s had a lot of  adventures  that s sure  you bet i d like to have a lot of adventures  like that         chapter v    tells about skinny s merit badge    the next day was sunday and two things happened  not counting dinner   early in the morning we drew lots to see who d be deck steward for the  day  and skinny was the one  that meant he d have to sweep up the deck  and wipe the rail and do everything outside like that  anyway  there  wasn t much to do     at about twelve o clock i went into the galley to cook dinner and  charlie seabury and brick warner went along to help me  while we were  peeling the potatoes  skinny came in and showed me three or four dimes  and some pennies  and said he found them on the deck  when he was  sweeping  he said   i ve been to every fellow in the troop and nobody  lost any money  are they yours      i told him no and so did brick and charlie and we said he had better  give them to mr  ellsworth   one of them is a french coin   brick said   and he showed it to me and i saw that it was      i guess one of the fellows dropped some change climbing over the  rail   charlie said   and maybe didn t miss it on account of not losing  all he had  hey       he d know if he had a french coin and lost it   brick said     it made me feel kind of funny  because all the while i knew where those  coins came from  anyway  skinny went and gave them to mr  ellsworth and  when we were all together at dinner  mr  ellsworth asked us if any  fellow owned a french coin that was missing  nobody said yes  and then  he said  kind of funny like   well  i suppose this is what our young  friend mr  walter harris would call a mystery   and he said we d put  the money in the troop treasury  then he gave it to will dawson  he s  in my patrol   because will is troop treasurer     somebody said   how about the french coin  that s no use in the  treasury   and mr  ellsworth said we d give that to skinny  because he  found the money  he said it would be a kind of a merit badge to skinny   for keeping his eyes open     i was mighty glad mr  ellsworth didn t ask us if anybody knew anything  about the money  because then  jiminy  i don t know what i would have  done  maybe it would have been all right to keep still because i wasn t   dead  sure whose it was  but all the while i knew i  was  sure  maybe  i would have said i knew only i didn t want to tell  hey  anyway  he  didn t ask and that was one good thing     after dinner skinny came to me all smiles and said   i ve got a merit  badge  it s for keeping my eyes open  and will you bore a hole in it so  i can wear it around my neck   oh  but that kid was happy     i said   did you have a good dinner  kiddo   and he said   yes  but  will you bore a hole in it so i can wear it around my neck   he looked  awful thin and his scout suit didn t fit him and his belt wasn t tight  enough and he didn t look anything like pictures you see of scouts  you  know what i mean  and when he smiled it made wrinkles in his cheeks   one thing sure  he was different from all the rest of the fellows  even  if it was only a little thing that he was interested in  he got all  excited about it  and his eyes got all bright and if he grabbed you by  the arm you could feel that his hand was trembling  he d be so excited   we made a lot of allowance for him  because he was sick and came out of  the slums  but anyway  one trouble with him was  that mr  ellsworth  couldn t make him study up scouting the way other fellows do  all of a  sudden he d go crazy for the gold medal or the eagle badge and you  couldn t tell him that a fellow has to get to be a first class scout   before he can be an eagle scout   he wants what he wants when he wants  it   that s what mr  ellsworth said  and he only just laughed and said    he ll hammer into shape all right  let him enjoy the trip      and it was just like him  i mean about that french coin  he was always  coming to me  too  as if i was scoutmaster and everything else  he  began clutching me by the arm and saying   i got it for keeping my eyes  open  didn t i  i got it for being honest and asking all the scout  guys  didn t i      i had to just pull his hand off my arm  he was holding so fast to it   cracky  i didn t know what to tell him  then i said   i tell you what  you do alf    i wasn t going to be calling him skinny   i said   you go  and ask vic norris if he s got an awl or a small gimlet  see  then i ll  fix it for you   vic had charge of the locker where we kept the lights  and oil and tools and all that kind of stuff     pretty soon he came back with an awning needle and asked me if it would  do  i think he would have gone crazy if i had told him no     i said   yes  i guess so  come ahead  and let go my arm  do you hear   i m not going to run away      then he said   i like you better than any of the scout guys       we re not guys  we re just scouts   i told him   you can cut out the  guys  didn t mr  ellsworth tell you that      the fellows were sitting around on the deck  reading  some of them were  sprawling around on the cabin roof  killing time and jollying pee wee   i don t know where mr  ellsworth was  but i guess he was inside writing  letters  anyway  it was nice and sunny and you could see the sun in the  water  over on shore  in st  george  i could hear a church bell and it  sounded clear  there weren t many boats out  except sometimes the boats  to coney island went by and we could hear the music  i thought i d  rather be where i was  anyway  maybe it was because it was sunday and  because it was so still all around that i had a good idea  anyway  i  thought it was a good idea  but  good night   it got me into a kind of  a scrape     that s one thing about me  i m always getting in scrapes     so then i took skinny and we climbed in through the galley window  i  guess nobody noticed us  nobody said anything except el sawyer  he  asked me if i was going to get supper      supper   i said   didn t you just have dinner   honest  that fellow  never thinks of anything except eats     when we got into the galley  i said to skinny   let s sit up on the  board so we can look out and see the bay   so we sat on the board that  was on two barrels  i used it to open cans on and slice bread and all  that  and i always washed it good and clean  you can bet  oh  but it  was nice sitting there and it was just as quiet as it is in the woods   sometimes a motor boat would go by and we could hear it chugging      one thing  nobody ll bother us here   i said   some fellows don t like  sunday  but i do      skinny said   i like christmas best  because rich people bring baskets  of food      cracky  i felt awful sorry for him         chapter vi    tells how skinny and i got together    first i bored a hole in the coin and hung it around skinny s neck  he  was all excited and said   now i ve got a regular merit badge  ain t  i      i said   no you haven t  but it s a good badge  all right  then i said    now i m going to tell you some things about merit badges  you get  merit badge because you re able to do special things  see  you get them  for being able to do things that some other fellows can t do  kind of   not exactly that   i told him   because most fellows can do the things  if they try hard enough  but  anyway  there isn t any merit badge for  keeping your eyes open  mr  ellsworth was only joking about that  and  especially you don t get any merit badge for being honest  because that  would be too easy  if you could get one for that  gee whiz  all the  fellows would have them  that s sure      he said   ain t it good to be honest      i told him sure it was  but it was too easy and that all the scouts  were honest anyway  even without badges  then i said   if you wore that  on account of being honest  that would insult all the other fellows   wouldn t it   he just stared at me  but didn t say anything   so you  have to be careful   i told him   not to be saying that you have a  reward for being honest  see      then i told him about there not being any badge for keeping his eyes  open and finding things   but there s a badge for something else like  that   i said   only you can t get it yet  because you have to learn a  lot of things first  and it s a lot of fun learning them  too      he said   can i learn them right now      i said   no  but you ll learn a lot of them up in camp   then i told  them that the one that had most to do with keeping his eyes open was  the stalking badge  so then i got out the handbook and showed him the  picture of it and read him what it said  gee williger  i don t see  where there was any harm in that  do you  i read him the three  conditions and the four sub divisions      so you see  that means keeping your eyes open all right   i told him    because you have to be all the time watching for signs and tracks in  the snow or in the dirt  so as you can tell where a bird went  maybe   and sneak up and watch him       that s one thing i can do   he said   sneak  i m a little sneak   everybody said so      good night  that kid was the limit      i don t mean that way   i told him   but you have to  stalk   that  means to follow a bird or an animal and watch them without them knowing  anything about it  see      he said  all excited like   i can sneak up on  em  so then can i have  the badge  for sneaking  like you said      gee whiz  i just sat back and laughed  then i said    stalking badge    not sneaking  but  stalking   that s the badge you re after  so that s  the one you want to think about  don t think about a whole lot of  things but just think about that      he said   i like you a whole lot  and that s the one i m going to get   because you say so      just then i noticed stut moran  we call him that because he stutters   going past the window  pretty soon i noticed him passing again and  walking very slow      you just keep your mind on that one badge and remember those letters    i said   and for goodness  sake don t talk about badges for sneaking   because  you take a tip from me  you can only do one thing at a time      he said   the poultry badge is a good one  it s got a picture of a  rooster on it       you should worry about pictures of roosters   i said   just keep  thinking about that one badge  you take my advice  because you re good  on keeping your eyes open and that s the badge for you  and you re  small and kind of thin and that s good in stalking  too  because you  can hide behind trees and things   then i said   if you ll make me a  promise that you ll just think about that one badge and not about a lot  of others all at once  when we get up to camp  i ll make you a basket  out of a peach pit to hang around your neck      just then the door of the galley opened and in came connie bennett   right behind him were vic norris and stut moran  connie is leader of  the elks and the other two fellows are elks  too  right away he began  and i saw he was mad      that s a good thing you re talking about   sneaking   he said     i said   what do you mean       he s getting a good lesson in sneaking all right   he shot right back  at me      gee whiz  i don t know what you re talking about   i said      oh  no   he said  all the while sort of sneering at me   i suppose you  didn t bring him in here so you could be where nobody else heard you   maybe you think you own the galley       sure i brought him in here so we could be alone   i said       sure you did    he said   just so you could start him after the  stalker s badge  we heard you make him promise to go after that and not  think about anything else  he s easy  that kid is       why should i    i began      you know well enough why   he said   who started the rule about not  having two of the same merit badges in a patrol       i did   i told him      yes   he said   and now you re trying to rush this kid through just so  you can get even with vic  what have  you  got to do with our patrol  anyway  don t you think we re old enough to take care of our new  members  all because you and vic were on the outs last summer      jingo  that made me mad   i forgot all about that   i said   didn t vic  treat me to a soda only last week  it wasn t a quarrel anyway  i should  worry about who has the stalker s badge in your patrol  i didn t even  know vic was after it  you know yourself the kid hasn t begun his  second class tests yet  what chance does  he  stand if vic is after it   i only thought i d try to do a good turn  cracky  it s hard enough to  think up anything to do out here on a sunday afternoon  you know that  yourself  i was waiting all day for somebody to fall overboard  so i  could jump in and save them  you re a lot of old grandmothers in your  patrol  if that s all you ve got to complain about  you d better go and  sweep the wind off the deck       you mean to tell me to go and sweep the wind off the deck   connie  said  coming right up close to me      sure   i said   and when you get through with that go and clean the  reflection out of the water  i should worry  here  take your new  member  if i d known vic was after the badge  i wouldn t have said a  word about it  you can bet  you ought to know me well enough to know i  was just giving him a few tips  did i have any quarrel with you  vic      honest  would you believe it  none of them said a word except   come  ahead  skinny   and the poor kid followed them out  not knowing what to  think  i guess      end of a perfect day   i said         chapter vii    tells about my merit badge    wasn t that a crazy thing  just because last summer i put a stalking  sign on one of vic s trees  how did i know it was his  as soon as he  told me  i marked off my claim the same as any scout would  maybe i  ought to have remembered that he was out for the stalker s badge  but  believe me  i have enough to remember with the silver fox patrol     gee whiz  nobody can say that i ever butt in when a patrol is breaking  in a tenderfoot  that s one thing i wouldn t do  i wouldn t even have  bothered to tell you about it at all  except that it had  momentous  consequences   that s what pee wee said     at supper there was a big round flat piece of wood tied with a rope at  my place and on it was printed   sneaker s badge    it must have been  cut out of a piece of wood from a grocery box  because i noticed on the  other side of it  it said   honey boy   i suppose it meant some kind of  cookies or crackers or soap maybe  so just for the fun of it i stood up  and said      friends and enemies  ever since about five o clock this afternoon i ve  been hunting for a chance to do a good turn  the first one i tried to  do didn t pan out  so here s my chance to do a good turn and i have to  thank the honorable elk patrol for giving me the chance   then i turned  the big wooden medal over so the other side showed and everybody read    honey boy   and began to laugh  even vie norris had to laugh   if it  wasn t for the elks i d have to go to bed without doing a good turn      crinkums  you ought to have seen mr  ellsworth laugh  all the time he  knew something was wrong  i guess  but he never bothered with things  like that   settle your own disputes   that s what he always said  the  only fellow that didn t take it as a joke was connie bennett and just  for that reason you ll have to hear more about it     one thing more happened that day  when it was nearly dark westy martin   he s my special chum  came to me and said   there s a boat coming this  way and i think it s coming here   i went over to the rail where all of  the fellows were watching and there was a rowboat with two men in it   headed straight for us  pretty soon they came alongside and  oh  boy  i  was so shaky that i just held onto the rail with my hand trembling   because they had badges on and i knew they were men belonging to the  government     good night  i said to myself  it s all up now  they re after lieutenant  donnelle  they re going to search the house boat and ask a lot of  questions and i ll have to tell     when they got on board one of them said   we just want to give you the  once over  mate      oh  didn t my heart go down to my feet  i thought it would be all right  if i didn t stay around because they couldn t ask me any questions if i  wasn t there  and i was on the side of lieutenant donnelle  i didn t  care what  so i went into the galley and began straightening things out  there  after a little while westy came and stuck his head in through  the window      are they gone   i asked him      sure   he said     then i said   what did they want       they were only just inspectors   he said   and they wanted to know if  we had power       you mean an engine   i asked him   sure   he said   because if a boat  has a  fixed engine   it has to have a license and a certain kind of  whistle and bell and lights and all that       a fixed engine   i said   if we had one it probably wouldn t be  fixed       they meant a stationary engine   he said   you crazy indian       what else did they say   i asked  because i was still kind of nervous      they told us we should have a life preserver for everybody on board  and a fog horn      cracky  wasn t i relieved   isn t pee wee fog horn enough   i said     just the same it started me thinking about lieutenant donnelle again   and after i went to bed i kept on thinking about him  so i couldn t get  to sleep  one thing  i knew i liked him a lot  that was sure  but now  since i knew about the new law  that a motor boat has to have a  license  i wondered why jake holden didn t have one and have the number  on his boat  like everybody has to  anyway  it was lucky for him that  he didn t have any number on  because now they d have a hard job  finding him  especially because i knew he didn t give his right name   and then i began wondering about the adventure that jake and lieutenant  donnelle had  one thing sure  it must be pretty bad to be out on the  ocean like that in a little boat and be almost dead  i was wondering if  there was any more to it than lieutenant donnelle told me  maybe   anyway  he d had lots of adventures in his life  that was sure  i was  glad he said we d go on a hike some day     after a while  when i couldn t get to sleep  i got up and went out on  the deck and sat in one of the big steamer chairs  oh  it was fine  it  was all pitch dark and all you could see were the lights on the boats   all of a sudden i heard a sound and saw a face and the hair round the  face was all hanging down and it gave me a scare  kind of     then i saw it was skinny  he said   can i sit down alongside of you      i said   you ought to be in bed   and he said   i can t go to sleep  because i keep thinking and i want to stay right near you  i ain t mad  at you  anyway  were you thinking about how they got mad at you      all the while he came closer and he took hold of my arm with his hand  and his hand was hot  even through my khaki shirt i could feel it  and  his eyes didn t look like the other fellows  eyes     i said   i couldn t sleep because i was thinking about a fellow that s  a hero  he s a big fellow  you know what a hero is   i said      are you a hero   that s what he said  that s just what he said     anyway  one thing i didn t know then  and that was that skinny was  going to have more to do with lieutenant donnelle than i was  poor  little kid  he didn t know it either  that was one good thing         chapter viii    tells about our trip up the hudson    he said   if they get mad when i talk to you  i ll talk to you on the  sly  it s all right to like a fellow that isn t in your patrol  isn t  it       sure it is   i told him   you have to like everybody  but you do what  they tell you and then nobody ll get mad      he said   the swimming badge is a good one  isn t it       it s a dandy one   i said  then he told me that was the one they  wanted him to try for  he said   can i try for it now      i thought i d better watch my step  safety first  hey  so i said   you  ask connie  i shouldn t think there d be any objection to trying now   then after you ve passed your first class tests you could just scoop  the badge right up  see       i looked at all the pictures of the badges   he said   and i like the  one with the picture of a rooster best  is the swimming one better than  that      i said   yes  because every scout has got to know how to swim  anyway   connie knows best  and he s your patrol leader  so you do whatever he  tells you to       will i be able to beat everybody swimming   he said     i told him maybe  if he tried hard  and then i told him he d better go  to bed  he said he wouldn t be able to sleep now  on account of  thinking about the swimming badge  anyway  he went and i noticed how  skinny his legs were  it made me feel awful sorry for him  because his  suit didn t fit him and looked kind of funny  his eyes were funny   anyway  and gave me the fidgets  but in the dark you could just see  them shine  i told him to go inside and go to sleep and not think about  the swimming badge     one thing about skinny  i knew he d never make a good all around scout   like some fellows  you know what i mean  now you take artie van arlen    he s got eleven merit badges and he s got the bronze medal  maybe you d  say photography was his bug  but he never went crazy about it  that s  one sure thing  take  me   i ve got nine merit badges  the more the  merrier  i don t care     but skinny could only think about one thing and he d go clean crazy  about it  mr  ellsworth says he s  intense   hanged if i know what that  is  all i know is that he couldn t think about a lot of things  he just  couldn t read the handbook through  all of a sudden  when he d be  reading it  he d see something that he liked  and good night  he d  forget everything else  mr  ellsworth said skinny would never do  anything except  one  thing  and most likely that would be a big stunt  and if he failed  it would kill him  i guess he was a kind of a genius   like  you know what i mean  either that or he was half crazy  i could  never make him out  i know that     one thing  i was mighty glad he was going in for the swimming badge and  i hoped the elks would help him  he d sure have the best swimmer in the  troop to help him and that was hunt ward  he can swim better than any  raven  or silver fox  either  i have to admit that  especially it s  good to go in for the swimming badge right away as soon as you join a  troop  even though you can t get your award till you pass your first  class tests  because  gee  every fellow ought to know how to swim   that s one sure thing     the next morning good and early we could see the  general grant    that s captain savage s tug   heading across the bay straight for us  and as soon as it got close enough  we gave captain savage a good  cheer  captain savage was standing up in the little house smoking his  pipe  and he shouted to us and said he was delayed on account of  getting his propeller wet  that was just like him  he was always  joking     then he shouted to us   it s a wonder you wouldn t get into shallow  water  do you know how many feet you ve got   pee wee shouted back    two  what do you think we are  quadrupeds   laugh  honest  that kid is  a scream     i guess we must have been in pretty shallow water  because captain  savage made us all hustle throwing ropes and winding them around  thing um bobs  you know what i mean  and he was in such a hurry that he  didn t come on the house boat at all  but he said we had a mighty neat   comfortable craft  and that it looked as if it might have slid off some  street or other into the water  he was awful funny     pretty soon we were sailing up the hudson alongside of the  general  grant   the day before i thought that when the tug came it would tow us  behind with a long rope and it seemed funny like  to be tied fast  alongside the tug  it seemed kind of as if the house boat was being  arrested  you know how i mean     anyway  i liked that way best because we could be always climbing back  and forth  and believe me  most of us were on the tug all the time  i  guess maybe captain savage liked pee wee  anyway  he called for pee wee  and me to go up in the pilot house  and it was fine to watch him steer  and pull the rope that made the whistle blow  jiminety  didn t we jump  the first time we heard it     captain savage said   yer see it don t cost me nuthin  fur a blow out   as you might say  now  if this here old craft was an automobile  how  much would i have to pay for tires with a blow out every minute  huh    then he d look awful funny like  at pee wee     you can bet captain savage was nice to us fellows and we all liked him   he had to stop at peekskill and he took us all ashore for a peek    that s what he said  and he treated us all to sodas  you get dandy  raspberry sodas in peekskill     after that we started for poughkeepsie and that was as far as he was  going to tow us  because he had to tow a barge down to new york  but   any way  we should worry  there isn t any tide above poughkeepsie and  any dinky little kicker could tow us up to catskill landing from there    believe me   i said   if there are any ways around here  we ll find  them   finding ways to do things is our middle name     we had captain savage on the house boat to lunch with us and mr   ellsworth made a speech and said we were all much obliged to him and   oh  boy  when that tug started down the river again  didn t we stand on  the cabin roof of the house boat and cheer captain savage  he had about  six blow outs before he got very far  just answering our cheers     oh  cracky  but he was one fine man         chapter ix    tells about skinny s swimming lesson    i don t know what to call this chapter  maybe it will come without  calling  hey  anyway  i should worry  maybe i ll think of a name when  i m finished with it  it will be mostly about skinny     there isn t much more to tell about our trip to catskill landing  but  you just wait  and there ll be a lot to tell you about our cruise down  again  don t be in a hurry  just you wait  more haste  less speed  but  take it from me  you don t get much speed out of a house boat  a  house boat belongs to the merry go round family  that s what mr  ellsworth  says     that night we kept the boat tied up to the dock in poughkeepsie and  took a hike around the town  while mr  ellsworth tried to find somebody  who would tow us up to catskill landing  when we got back  he said he  had been talking with a man who had a little steam yacht and would tow  us as far as catskill landing  he said it wouldn t cost anything   because anyway he was going up through lake champlain and lake george  and he was strong for the boy scouts  you hear lots of men say that   but  one thing  he wasn t going for two days and so we d have to stay  tied up in poughkeepsie waiting for him  you see we were a kind of a  tramp boat  but what did we care as long as we got to camp some time or  other  scouts are tramps anyway  hey     so now i have to tell you about that two days we spent in poughkeepsie  and most of the time we spent in teaching skinny to swim  of course   that was up to the elks and you can bet i didn t interfere  nor any of  my patrol either  but i was mighty glad to see how easy it was for him  to learn      illustration  most of the time was spent in teaching skinny to swim       that kid is half fish   doc carson said to me      no wonder   i said   most all his life has been spent in the marshes   he s going to be a cracker jack  you see       he ll walk away with that badge when he once gets started   westy  said      you mean he ll swim away with it   i said   gee williger  look how  that little codger can dive      one thing  there was a dandy place for learning  that s sure     we put the skiff into the water and a couple of the elks rowed around  near the house boat  keeping near  while hunt ward showed skinny the  strokes  the rest of us sat along the cabin roof  cheering just so s  the kid would be encouraged  he looked awfully thin and little in his  bathing suit and whenever he climbed up to the deck of the house boat  the wet cloth stuck tight to him and made him look  oh  i don t know   kind of like a marsh rat  as you may say  that s what he always said  people called him  a  swamp rat   and i guess he was even kind of proud  of it     one sure thing  he was game  and he was just the same in learning to  swim as he was in everything else  he got all excited and wanted to go  too fast  as soon as he got the hang of it and could manage a few  strokes   good night   he wanted to swim across the river  he started  right off before the fellows in the boat noticed him and was heading  across stream  two or three times we heard him sputtering and shouting     now can i have that badge       late that afternoon they let him dive off the deck  it was low and it  didn t make much of a dive  of course  he didn t dive right  he only  just jumped and went kerflop into the water  and he had us all  laughing  as soon as he found out how much fun it was  he kept climbing  up and splashing into the water again  oh  boy  it was as good as a  circus to see him  then he d go swimming to the skiff and climb in just  like a little eel  and sit there shivering     you can bet that kid is going to have the swimming badge all right  we  all said  the trouble is going to be to hold him back  and we were  right  too  because when he came up on the cabin roof to get dry  all  of a sudden  before any of us knew it  he was over at the edge and  dived off before mr  ellsworth had a chance to call to him  that was  sure too much of a dive for a beginner  for if he hit the water face  down and flat   good night   that might have been the end of him  the  skiff was hauled up then so hunt ward dived in after him  but he had to  swim some to catch him and it was mighty funny to see them     that night mr  ellsworth gave skinny a good lecture and told him he  mustn t do things like that until he was told to  but i guess skinny  didn t understand  when i saw mr  ellsworth sitting alone on the deck  after dark  i went up and sat down and began talking to him  i often do  that     i said   i guess skinny s going to get the swimming badge  all right       yes  i guess he is   that s what mr  ellsworth said   skinny s too  much for me  if the boys would only teach him a little scouting  i d be  better pleased  he wants to be a swimmer now  he s not thinking about  being a scout  he thinks of the badge only as something to wear       i tried to teach him some things out of the handbook   i said   but  the elks didn t like it  i tried to tell him some things about scouting  and all i got was a good lecture from connie  nix on teaching fellows  in other patrols      mr  ellsworth seemed awfully worried  kind of  he just sat thinking a  minute  then he said   i m afraid skinny is going to be hard to tame   he ll make a fine swimmer and a fine stalker       i said   he calls that sneaking      mr  ellsworth laughed and said   but the principal thing is to make him  a good scout  has he done any good turns      i said   the only good turns i know about  are the good turns he made  in diving  he turns every which way       well  i hope he can forget about swimming long enough to eat his  supper   mr  ellsworth said     but just the same skinny didn t         chapter x    tells about skinny and the elks    well  that was the way it was with skinny and i could see that the elks  were rushing him through  so that he d get the badge  that used to be  one trouble with the elks and i don t care if they do know i said it   they got one good lesson to cure them  that s sure  the trouble with  them was they were making a collection of badges and when you re out  for badges  you skip at lot of pages in the handbook  that s sure     the next day i said to connie bennett  this is just what i said  i  said   i hope you won t get mad at me again if i say something about  skinny  because  anyway  it s none of  my  business  that s sure  but  as long as you fellows are busy teaching him stunts and things  i don t  see that there would be any harm in it  if i read some things in the  handbook to him  some other kind of things  i mean      he said   what kind of things       oh  just about the laws and things like that  like about being honest  and obedient  you know       you keep your hands off my patrol   that s just what he said   and you  needn t start hinting that the elks are dishonest        who s hinting that   i said  kind of mad   you remind me of an  airplane  you re always going up in the air       if any of my patrol are dishonest  they ll be thrown out   he said    and maybe they ll be welcome in the silver foxes       sure   i said   we make a specialty of burglars and pickpockets  we  eat  em alive  all i was asking you was that you let me teach skinny  some of the  idea  stuff  you know what i mean       you re jealous because he s a genius   connie said   and you want to  fill him up with grandmother stuff  why don t you let the kid alone   we ll take care of him       all right   i said   i should worry  only there s no use getting mad   we re all one troop       yes  but we re three separate patrols   he said      united we stand  divided we sprawl   i said  then he walked away   that was the second day at poughkeepsie and most all day the elks were  busy turning skinny into a fish  some of the rest of us went up to  metzger s candy store to get some jaw breakers  did you ever eat those   pee wee was quiet for an hour munching one  the licorice ones are best   in the afternoon we sat along the cabin roof watching skinny and the  elks  good night  you should have seen that kid  every time the fellows  in the boat had to row after him  because he d go swimming away on his  own hook  he never paid any attention to what they told him      throw him a jaw breaker   grove bronson said   just for fun       nix   i said   you don t catch me interfering with the buzz saw  twice  was enough  when i try any polishing  i ll polish up the silver foxes       go ahead  throw him one   grove said to pee wee  but i guess pee wee  didn t have any jawbreakers to spare  his cheeks were sticking out and  there was licorice all over his lips  and he said  this is the way it  sounded   i  ooo  go  to  goo  to  are    something like that  honest      go in and wash your face   doc said   you look like a minstrel actor  in a rainstorm       yu  sht  p  m  nd  r  n  business   pee wee blurted out  crackey  i  thought i d die     pretty soon doc carson  he s a raven  threw a jaw breaker out into the  water and skinny got it before it went down      what do you know about that little water snake   el sawyer said  then  he shouted   bully for you  skinny      i said   you d better look out  you ll get yourself in trouble       what do i care for the elks   he said      that s all right   i said   connie s got skinny copyrighted  all  rights reserved      then  all of a sudden  wig weigand shouted   look at that  will you   look      we could just see hunt ward reach out of the skiff for skinny  when all  of a sudden he disappeared and came up about twenty feet from the  skiff  everybody began laughing and i guess the elks were mad  because  they thought we were just sitting up there kidding them     right then i heard mr  ellsworth calling out from just in back of us    take him in the skiff and bring him aboard  huntley       now  e  ng  t  gt  cld  down   pee wee said  munching away on a jaw  breaker      you look as if you d been gargling a bottle of ink   i told him    don t talk  you can t do two things at once      pretty soon skinny came up the ladder to the cabin roof where we were  all sitting  his wet bathing suit stuck to him and it made him look  terribly thin  and his hair was all streaked and the water was dripping  from his face  but anyway  his eyes were bright and all excited  i  never saw another fellow that had eyes like that  he had the piece of  candy in his hand and it was all melting from the water and his hand  was black and sticky  jiminy  he looked awful small and skinny  alongside of mr  ellsworth  and i had to feel sorry for him as soon as  mr  ellsworth began to speak     skinny looked up at him and said   i got it  i dived and got it  see  i  saved it  i didn t eat it  i can swim under the water  now can i have  the badge   cracky  the way he stared  if i d had the badge  i d have  torn it off my arm and handed it to him  honest i would     mr  ellsworth just looked at him and said   no  you may not have the  badge  before you can have the badge for swimming you must be a better  scout  you must learn to be obedient  you heard one of your patrol tell  you not to go under water  you heard your patrol leader tell you to get  into the skiff  do you think you know better than they do  what is best  for you      even still he didn t pay any attention  he was so excited   now am i a  hero   he said      no  you are not a hero   mr  ellsworth told him   and you will go  inside and get your uniform on  the first duty of a scout is to obey  his leader  and you have failed to do that  you are very much mistaken  as to the meaning of heroism  and it wasn t necessary to bring us any  proof that you got the candy or whatever that is  scouts are not in the  habit of lying and deceiving  we expect always to believe you without  proof  throw that away and go inside and get your clothes on      gee  maybe he was right  but anyway  i felt mighty sorry for skinny   his eyes were all full of tears and he went over to the rail and threw  the sticky jaw breaker out into the water  i i could see by his neck  that he was gulping and trying not to cry and  oh  boy  it made me feel  bad  it seemed as if it was always that way with him  that he had to be  disappointed and that things never came out right with him  anyway  i  said to myself  it s connie s fault  and all the rest of the elks are  to blame  too  why didn t they tell him in the beginning about those  other things  all they cared about was showing their new member off to  the rest of the troop  and you see how it ended     first i thought i d go in and talk to skinny and tell him he was a  wonder  for that was just what he was  and mr  ellsworth knew it  too   then i decided that i d better not on account of connie  and anyway  i  wouldn t have any right to go in and spoil what our scoutmaster said   would i         chapter xi    tells you how to get to temple camp    gee whiz  i wouldn t say anything against the elks  that s sure   because they re all peachy scouts when you come right down to it  but i  have to admit that they re crazy about stunts  they have more merit  badges in their patrol than there are in the ravens and silver foxes  put together  hunt ward s sleeve looks like one of those indian totem  poles  there are so many badges on it  anyway  i should worry  we have  twenty two badges in our patrol  and more good turns in the troop book  than either of the other patrols  that s what counts  too  good turns     the trouble with the elks was that every time they got a new fellow  he  must take a header for some badge or other and most always he would  have two or three stunt badges  that s merit badges  you know  waiting  for him when he passed his first class tests   begin at the beginning    that s what mr  ellsworth always said  and he says it s more important  to know the scout oath and follow it  than it is to get the eagle   award  connie s a good patrol leader all right  gee  nobody can say he  isn t  but he s crazy about stunts and merit badges  he always seemed  to think that that was all there was to scouting  but believe me   there s many a girl wears a sailor hat who screams when she gets in a  boat  anyway  i m not going to be knocking anybody     well  the next day in the middle of the night  i mean the next night  early in the morning  i mean when it was just getting light  after the  night after the next day  we got to catskill landing  and oh  boy   wasn t i glad  we tied the houseboat to an old pier maybe a couple of  hundred yards above the regular landing  and had a good swim and then  breakfast before we started up to camp  mr  ellsworth let skinny go in   but he told him to be careful not to disobey his leaders or he d have  to come out     jimmy  it was funny to see that kid  i don t know how to tell you about  it  but he seemed to kind of swim different from the other fellows  and  he couldn t help getting excited  they threw pieces of stick for him to  get  and he would swim out and bring them in in his mouth just like a  dog  and then wait for more  all anxious like  one thing about skinny i  noticed  and that was that all the fellows  even in his own patrol  got  a lot of fun out of him  making him do things  but nobody exactly  seemed to make friends with him  anyway  i guess he didn t care  he was  always so crazy about what he was doing  even a lot of summer people  stood around on the shore  watching him in the water and saying he was  a wonder  i guess they didn t know what to do with themselves  hey   mostly that s the way it is with summer people     i flopped some flapjacks for breakfast and el sawyer  he s a raven   hung one of them around his neck for a souvenir  he s a fresh kid   maybe you think it s easy to flop flapjacks  i should worry     oh  boy  now comes the best part of this whole story  as soon as we  could get our stuff into the duffel bags and the boat all tied fast  we  started out on our hike for temple camp  you can bet i always like to  hike  but early in the morning  oh  it s simply great  some fellows can  drink sodas early in the morning but i can t  but anyway  early hikes  are my middle name  you know  just when the sun is coming up  all red  like  and peeking over the hill  just as if it was stalking     oh  boy  if scouts could only sneak up as quiet as all that     now the way you get to temple camp is to hike up through catskill  village till you get to the old turnpike road  and then go straight  along that till you come to a big boarding house  where there are a lot  of people sitting on the porch waiting for breakfast or dinner or  supper  or time to go to bed  then you hit the road up through the  woods till you come to a turtle  i guess he isn t there now  but  anyway  he was there last year  then you cut up through the woods and  follow the scouts  signs  and you ll come out at leeds  that s a  village  you ll see all the summer people waiting for their mail at the  post office  some of them will say   oh  there go some boy scouts   aren t they cute   they always say that  there s a stationery store  there too  where you can buy fishhooks and marshmallows  and other  things to eat  i don t mean you eat fishhooks     anyway  you go down main street till you come to a smell like rotten  wood and then you turn in where the willow trees are and you come to an  old sawmill  if you holloa from there  they can hear you at camp  then  you cut through the woods and follow the trail till all of a sudden you  come plunk out on the edge of the lake and it s all surrounded by  woods  that s black lake  and believe me  black is my favorite color  when it comes to lakes  then you go across in the boats to temple camp     mr  john temple started temple camp  he s rich and owns a lot of  railroads and things  he used to be mad at the scouts  but after a  while when he saw what kind of fellows scouts are  he got glad at them  and started temple camp  he s awful grouchy when you first see him  but  you should worry about that  once  when he was out west about some  railroads  he saw jeb rushmore  who was a trapper and all that  and he  was getting old  so mr  temple made him come to temple camp to be camp  manager and live there  oh  boy  you re going to see him in just a  minute and i can hardly wait         chapter xii    tells all about our row on black lake    so that s the way we went to temple camp  but there are short cuts to  the hudson besides that when we got near to the lake we all got  anxious  you know how a fellow is when he s almost to a place he s been  thinking about a lot     doc carson said   i see the water is still wet   that was just to jolly  pee wee      that s because of the recent rains   i said      the which   artie asked me      you think you re smart talking about  recent rains   don t you    pee wee shouted   you got that out of a book       i bet there ll be a lot of troops there this summer   el sawyer said     pretty soon i saw he was right  too  because five boats came across to  get us and there was a strange scout in every single one of them  uncle  jeb was waiting at the landing on the other side to meet us  and oh   cracky  didn t it look good to see the big pavilion and the tents and  patrol cabins upside down in the water  there were a lot of scouts  waiting too  and i could see the camp was pretty full     uncle jeb said   wall  roay   that s just the way he talks  slow like    haow s all the boys from bridgeboro  i reckon little pee wee ain t  growed at all  hain t you never goin  ter grow  pee wee  and artie and  grovey  and el  and hunter ward and  let s see  vic norris  every  plaguy one of yer here  ain t none of yer died or gone off ter war   hey  and there s connover bennett  too  large as life  and still crazy  about raisin cake  i reckon  wall  wall  it s good ter see ye all      i said   it s good to see you  too  uncle jeb  gee  all the fellows  were crazy to see you  that s one sure thing       and still making them flapjacks  hey   he said   i remember when one  uv them new hampshire scouts scaled one uv them flapjacks uv your n  across the lake  i reckon you re the same old roay that put the  mosquito dope in the biscuits  yer remember that   cracky  i m not  going to tell you anything about my past life  but summer before last  up there   oh  boy      most of the morning we rested up and got our patrol cabins cleaned out  and all fixed up  and in the afternoon we banged around and got  acquainted with some of the new troops     just before supper  westy and i went down for a swim and there were  connie bennett and two or three of the elks diving with skinny  a whole  lot of fellows were standing around watching  most of them laughed at  skinny  but they all had to admit he was a crackerjack  i knew the elks  were just kind of showing him off and putting him through a lot of  freak stunts just to get their name up around the camp     after supper  westy and i and a new fellow in an ohio troop were rowing  around near the shore  he was an awful nice fellow  quiet like  just  like me  only different  all of a sudden we noticed skinny standing on  the shore and he called out and asked us if we d take him in      better watch your step   westy said   safety first       where s your patrol   i called to him      they went on a hike   he called back   can i go with you       you go and ask mr  ellsworth   i said   and if he says it s all right   come ahead      we could see him scooting pell mell around the edge of the cooking  shack  his spindle legs as thin as sticks  bert winton  that was the  new fellow  watched him  kind of laughing  and then he said   queer  little codger  isn t he      i said   yes  he s new and he came out of the slums  i guess he ll  never work in harness  that s what our scoutmaster says       swims like an eel   winton said   why didn t they take him hiking  i  wonder       hanged if  i  know   westy said   he s going to win them the swimming  badge  all right  but he doesn t seem to be friends with them exactly   they make good use of him  anyway       kind of a performing bear  hey   bert said      something like that   i told him   i wish i had him in my patrol  i  know that       guess he wouldn t fit into any patrol   winton said   he seems to be a  kind of an odd number      pretty soon skinny came running back shouting for all he was worth  and  believe me  he did look like an odd number  his streaky hair was all  down over his forehead and his eyes were like a couple of camp fires   he was shouting    don t go  don t go  i can go with you      we rowed over to shore and as he climbed in i could see that he was  trembling all over  just for fear we wouldn t wait for him  i suppose    i was going to swim out to you  i was   he said   if you didn t wait       you wouldn t want your scout suit to get all wet  would you   i said    sit down and don t be so excited       i like the water better than hiking  anyway   he said   and i like   you  best of all      i said   the pleasure is mine   and then we all laughed      you can make fun of me all you want   he said   i don t care  i told  them they could make fun of me all they want if they d let me go with  them  but they wouldn t let me go       they wouldn t  huh   bert winton said  and he studied skinny awful  funny like      when i win them the badge  then they ll take me  won t they   he said      i guess so   i told him      i m going to win the cup for them in the contest  too   he said   i m  going to win it for them before i go home  then i ll be friends with  them  i told them i d win it if  you  didn t try for it       you should worry about me   i said   i can swim  but  good night   i m  not in the contest class  and maybe you re not either  so don t be too  sure      he said   i m going to win them the cup  and i m going to win them the  badge  but i don t have to get to be a first class scout guy to win the  cup  i don t  it s made of silver  once my father stole a lot of  silver  it s all fancy  that cup       i know all about the cup  alf   i said   because  gee  i didn t like  to be calling him skinny   but don t call the fellows scout guys  just  scouts  that s enough   he just looked at me kind of wild  as if he  didn t understand  the same as he always did when anybody called him  down  or tried to tell him something     for a few minutes nobody spoke and we just rowed around  then westy  said   so that s their game  is it      i knew well enough what he meant  every season mr  temple offers a  silver cup to the best swimmer at temple camp  once mr  temple had a  son who got drowned because he couldn t swim  and that s why he s so  interested in fellows being good swimmers  that silver cup hasn t got  anything to do with the scout swimming badge  you can t win that   anyway they won t give it to you  till you ve passed your first class  tests  but anybody can try for the silver cup  and you can bet it s a  big honor for any troop or patrol to have that  most always they have  the contest on labor day     i said   alf  you can bet i d be glad to see you win that cup  but  don t forget that there are more than a hundred fellows at the camp   some of the troops come from the seashore  you know that  and they re  all crackerjack swimmers  it comes mighty hard to be disappointed  so  don t you stay awake at night thinking about it   i said that because i  could just see that poor kid dreaming about handing that cup over to  his patrol leader  and honestly  i didn t think there was much chance  for him     pretty soon bert winton leaned over and said to me   do you suppose  that s true about his father       guess so   i told him      he doesn t seem to be very much ashamed of it   he said     all i could say was   he s a queer kid  he s all the time blurting out  things like that       maybe it s because he s just plain honest   winton said      but you d think he d be ashamed   i told him     he just shrugged his shoulders and looked kind of funny at skinny  i  had a kind of a hunch that he liked him and believed in him  anyway  i  remembered those words    just plain honest           chapter xiii    tells about the strange campers    it was nice rowing around there in the dark  it wasn t so very dark   though  because the moon was out and you could see it in the water just  as plain as if it had fallen kerflop out of the sky and was laying in  the bottom of the lake  over on shore we could see the camp fire  getting started and black figures going toward it  and the blaze was  upside down in the water      how about camp fire   westy said      we should worry about camp fire   i told him   there s plenty of time   wait till it gets to blazing up good and high       it s fine out here   bert winton said   i always take a row before  going in to camp fire       we should worry about you  too   i heard somebody say  and then a lot  of fellows began laughing  by that i knew they had heard everything we  said     winton said   funny how clear you can people talk when they re on the  water      pretty soon we were away over at the other side of the lake and it was  awfully still  and even our oars seemed to make a lot of noise dripping  the water     all of a sudden westy said   there s a canoe      we could only just see it as it went gliding by us  but i noticed there  were two dark figures in it     winton said   shh  wait till they pass us  then i ll tell you about  them       i bet they re evil cronies   i said   like they usually have in  books   because you know how it is in books  there are always a couple  of bad fellows that won t join the good ones  but go camping right near  them and make a lot of trouble for them  hanged if i see why they don t  join in with them and be done with it  hey     pretty soon winton said very low   they re a couple of millionaire  campers  young fellows  their people are staying near leeds and those  fellows have got a tent right across there in the woods near the shore   they re having the time of their lives with an up to date oil stove and  a couple of fireless cookers and some thermos bottles and things   they ve got cushions with buckskin fringe  presents from dearie and  sweetie  i suppose  and they ve got a cedar chest with brass hinges   regular modern daniel boones  they are       oh  me  oh  my   westy whispered   have they got jackknives hanging  from their belts       right the first time   bert winton said      and leather cases of writing paper   i said  just for fun      everything except a burglar alarm and a telephone   bert said   but  they re not half bad chaps  we ll row over and see them some day  they  have wild times around their camp fire  telling yarns and watching the  roaring blaze in their oil stove  they ve got a fancy indian blanket   you ought to see it  one of them paddled over to camp one day and  wanted to buy a fishing rod  he had about a hundred dollars with him   he couldn t even swim        good night    i said     then  all of a sudden skinny piped up   if i had a hundred dollars i d  buy a canoe  i would  i d have it painted red  i d have a sail for it   too  then all the fellows would like me  wouldn t they      i said   shh  don t shout like that  people can hear you all over  the  fellows like you now  don t you worry       i don t care if they hear me   he said     pretty soon we rowed over and went up and sprawled around camp fire   gee  whiz  i guess the whole camp was there  one of the scouts in a  virginia troop was telling a yarn about somebody who had an adventure  at sea  it was mighty interesting  you can bet  and it kind of started  me thinking about lieutenant donnelle  little i knew of the terrible  thing that was going to happen at camp the very next day  right across  from me i could see skinny sitting near mr  ellsworth  but the rest of  the elks were sprawling around with the ravens  one thing  my patrol  always sticks together  skinny s eyes looked awful big and wild  kind  of  with the fire shining right in his face and it made me feel kind of  spooky to look at him  poor kid  little he knew what he was going to go  through  anyway  i wished that the elks would call him over to them   probably he was thinking about how he was going to win them the silver  cup  hey         chapter xiv    tells about the storm on black lake    one thing i have to admit  and that is that mr  ellsworth helped me a  lot with this chapter and the next one too  but just the same both of  them are by me  all right     it s a funny thing  but all that night i was dreaming about that canoe  with the two fellows in it  i could hear them paddling just as clear as  could be  only when i woke up before daylight  i knew it was just the  sound of rain on the roof of our patrol cabin  it was dripping into the  rain ditch  i guess     pretty soon i went to sleep again  and i could see skinny standing in  front of me and his eyes were staring and his face was all white and  there was some blood on it and he said   i want to be a silver fox   because my father stole a lot of silver  so haven t i got a right to  be   i tried to answer him  but there was a loud noise and he couldn t  hear and then  all of a sudden  i woke up and i knew the noise was  thunder and skinny wasn t there at all  anyway  it made me feel kind of  creepy and i was glad when i saw him at breakfast     all that morning it rained and most of the scouts stayed in their tents  and cabins  some of them played basketball in the pavilion  three  fellows from the boston troop went out fishing  but they had to come in  it was raining so hard     before dinnertime  uncle jeb called some of us to move the mess boards  into the pavilion  because it was beginning to blow from the east and  the awnings and thatch roofs over the mess boards didn t keep the rain  off  because it blew sideways  out on the lake the water was churning  up rough with little white caps  jiminy  i never saw it like that  before     it was so dark and rainy that a fellow couldn t read even  anyway  i   couldn t because  oh  i don t know  i felt queer kind of  a lot of us  sat on the wide porch of the pavilion  the side facing the lake  it was  wide enough so the rain didn t come in and wet us as long as we stayed  way back near the windows  we sat in a long row with our chairs tilted  back  it was nice there     somebody said   that spring board looks lonely sticking out into the  lake  look how the drops jump off it  just like fellows diving       not much of a day for the race   doc carson said      what race   pee wee shouted      the human race   doc said   no sooner said than stung      we were just starting to jolly pee wee  because that s our favorite  indoor sport  when somebody said   there s one of the gold dust twins  out  he must be crazy       he comes from maine   another fellow said   i guess he s a maniac      but anyway  it was no joke  that was sure  away over near the other  side of the lake we could see the canoe bobbing up and down and it  seemed to be coming toward us      only one of them is in it   i said      and that s one too much on a day like this  that pair are sure nutty    doc said     but just the same the canoe came along and one of those campers was  sitting in the stern paddling it  he was having a pretty hard job  i  could see that  but maybe it wasn t as dangerous as it looked  because  if you know how to manage a canoe it s better than an old tub of a boat  in bad weather      he s making it all right   one of the fellows said   he s game  that s  sure      pretty soon he came alongside the landing and turned his canoe over to  let the water out  and then came up to the pavilion      pretty wet   he said      you said something   westy answered him   you took a big chance coming  over       i d sure have been drowned if i  hadn t  come   he laughed   i wonder  if you fellows can sell us a shovel  our tent is floating      i had to laugh  because that s always the one thing that most campers  who aren t used to it forget about  i mean digging a drain ditch  outside their tent  and the first time it rains   good night   they get  drowned out like rats  i thought he was a pretty nice kind of a fellow   only he was one tenderfoot  that was sure  he had a swell bathing suit  on with one of those waterproof mackinaw jackets over it  i guess his  people were rich all right  and i suppose that s why the fellows at  camp called the pair the gold dust twins  he took some bills out of his  pocket and said   we want to buy a shovel  you can t dig a trench with  a canoe paddle  there s fine swimming in our tent      then bert winton said  kind of quiet in that way he had   i don t think  you ll need any money here  i ll get hold of one of the scoutmasters    and he started down the steps  just then i noticed skinny standing on  the steps and bert winton gave him a push  just for fun  as he went by      come on in out of the rain  alf   i said  because i knew he was just  hanging there  because he was afraid to come up where the rest of us  were  i asked him where his patrol was  and he said   in the cabin   playing checkers   i said   don t  you  know how to play checkers   and  he said   no   after that i didn t notice him     pretty soon the gold dust twin came back with a shovel and mr  elting   who is resident trustee  was with him  telling him he d better not go  back across the lake on account of its blowing up harder      i could never get around through the woods   he said   because i tried  it       some of these boys will show you the trail   mr  elting said     but he said   no   and that as long as he came he was going to go back   he said he didn t want any escort  he was pretty game  that was one  sure thing  i guess maybe he felt sort of ashamed to have boy scouts  show him the way  because he was older than most of us  anyway  he  started back and we sat there watching him  and pretty soon it seemed  as if a kind of a screen was behind him  the rain was so thick and  there was so much mist  it made him look sort of like a ghost or a  you  know  a spectre     then  all of a sudden artie van arlen s hat blew off and i heard a  branch of a tree crack      where is the canoe   doc said  all excited   do you see it      we looked all over  but couldn t see him anywhere  that was just how  quickly it happened  then  all of a sudden i could hear a voice  but i  couldn t hear it plain  because the wind was blowing the other way and  the rain was making such a racket on the porch roof  the voice was all  mixed up with the wind and it sounded spooky and gave me the creeps     for a couple of seconds nobody said anything         chapter xv    tells about an accident    the next thing i knew there was a loud splash and i heard the  spring board down on the shore crack  and when i looked there i could see  it jumping up and down     i knew what that meant      who dived   westy shouted   he must be crazy  he can t make it  hurry  up  let s get a boat out  do you hear the voice now      after that everything seemed to happen all in a jumble  westy and doc  and i ran to the landing and got one of the boats off  while the  fellows up on the porch shouted to the fellow who had dived to come  back  because he couldn t make it  i heard one fellow yell   you re  crazy  come back while you can  they re getting a boat out      i was so busy helping to push the boat into deep water that i didn t  think any more about the fellow who dived  only i supposed he must have  turned back  i heard the fellows shouting  but i didn t pay any  attention  out on the lake i could hear the voice now calling help  and  it sounded creepy  like a person trying to call while he s gargling     doc said   it s all up with him  hurry  anyway      it was pretty hard getting the boat started  because the wind kept  blowing it ashore  and we had to pull and tug for all we were worth  i  got in back of it and shoved out till i was beyond my depth  then  jumped in while dock and westy pulled for all they were worth  trying  to get her ahead     i guess most everybody at the camp was up on the porch by now  and  there were a lot crowding on the spring board      pull hard   doc said   the next cry will be the last one  i know the  sound      just then we heard a long cry  but it didn t say any word  just h  e    e      and then it stopped     doc said   pull hard anyway  you steer her  roy  right over there  a  little to the left  you can see the canoe      i looked over there and saw it upset and no one was near it                                                 i can t tell you all about what happened  i tried and tore up three  pages  because it makes me all excited myself  as you might say  i can  hear that crowd on the porch shouting just as plain as on that very day  it happened  and every time it rains and it s dark and windy  it  reminds me of it too  the next thing i knew we were right close beside  two fellows and westy was holding them and shouting    let go  i ve got  him       the fellow who wouldn t let go was skinny     i can t tell you about how he looked  honest  i just can t tell you   but there was blood on his face just the same as i saw in the dream  as  sure as i m sitting here  there was  he had hold of the camping  fellow s mackinaw jacket with his teeth and the fellow s mouth was  stretched wide open and skinny s hand was clutching his teeth and chin  and holding his head above water that way  it wasn t like any rule for  holding a drowning fellow  anyway  no rule  i  ever heard of  even now  i can see that skinny little white hand straining to hold that mouth  and chin  and afterward i saw how there was a cut across skinny s  fingers where the fellow s teeth had pressed  skinny s arm was shaking  just like a rope shakes when it s pulled too tight and his eyes were  staring crazy     while i kept the boat steady  doc leaned out and pressed skinny s jaws  so as to make his teeth let go  and even then when we dragged him in  over the stern  he had a piece of mackinaw jacket in his mouth     i said   skinny  don t act crazy  he s saved   but he only sat on the  back seat trembling all over as if he had a fit  it wasn t because he  was cold  it was just because he was excited and crazy like     i didn t notice the camping fellow much after i saw that he was alive  and that doc had him breathing all right  westy took the oars but i  couldn t help him on account of skinny  and i couldn t do much for  skinny either  he was gone clean out of his head and started screaming     i did it  i did it       i said   yes  you did it  try to be quiet and get rested now  can t you  see he s all right       i held him up till you came   he panted   i m a hero  i want to go and  be all by myself  i do      i said   hsh  skinny  listen        he called me   skinny shouted    he called me  out loud       i know   i said   and you went  sure  you re a hero   but of course  i  knew the fellow never called him at all  anyway  maybe the wind made it  sound that way to him  he just sat there shaking all over and staring  wild   three times   he panted out   and that s the last  i  i got my  hand in his mouth before  before  he said it  i did  that s the way  murderers do  it is  i did it  even i know how to strangle  i do  i m a  hero      i said   listen here  alf  you re a wonder        i  i  i  could  kill  you if i wanted to   he screamed   i can do  anything  i can sneak  stalk  i can take things out of your pocket  i  can choke people  i       that s just the way he went on and i saw he had gone all to pieces   maybe from the strain  and didn t know what he was saying  i just put  my arm around him and i could feel that he was shaking all over  but it  wasn t anything like a chill     he kept saying   i want to be alone by myself now      i said   alf  listen a minute   please   you can go and be alone by  yourself  you can go in our patrol cabin and i ll chase all the fellows  out  i know how you feel  it was wonderful  alf  try to get quieted  down now  you saved him       i  i can  bite    he said     i said   yes  i know  but try to take it easy now  because we re coming  to shore  you have to act like a real hero      but as soon as we came into shallow water he jumped out of the boat and  scooted around the edge of the pavilion  like a wild animal  in a  couple of seconds everybody in camp was around the boat  waiting to  hear what the camp doctor said  as soon as i knew that the fellow was  going to be all right  i went away to find skinny  no one else seemed  to miss him     pretty soon i heard a voice calling   what s your hurry  blakeley   and  i turned around and saw bert winton hurrying to catch up to me      i m going to look for that kid   i said     for about half a minute we walked along together  and then he said kind  of quiet  sort of   do you think he s crazy       i don t think he s exactly crazy   i said   but he s all gone to  pieces       he sounded crazy from the shore   he said      he didn t know what he was saying  anybody could tell that   i  answered him      what did he do   winton asked me      oh  he just nearly killed him trying to save him   i said      hmph   winton said      he ll be all right   i told him      most of the fellows here think he s crazy   he said   last night they  could hear him way out on the lake  boasting about his father stealing  silver   better keep your watch under your pillow and let uncle jeb  take care of your coin   that s what all the fellows are saying       is that what  you re  saying   i said      i m not saying anything   he shot back      you saw what he just did   i told him      i saw what he just did   he said      you don t seem to be very excited about it   i shot back at him again      what s the good of getting excited   he said      do  you  think he s crazy and a thief   i asked him      i think he may be a little crazy  at times   he said   as to being a  thief    and then he screwed his mouth up  but didn t say anything  more      a hero thief   i said  kind of sarcastic  for the way he talked made  me mad      he s sure a hero   he said      i m glad you think so   i told him   heroes aren t usually thieves   are they       not as a rule   he said  kind of quiet and all the while kicking a  stone      well then   i said      well then   he said too      well then  there you are   i spoke up      well then  here we are   he said  with an awful funny smile   and the  question is  where is the little skinny fellow       i guess i can find him without any help from you   i said     then he walked away  cracky  maybe i couldn t understand skinny very  well  but i sure couldn t understand bert winton at all         chapter xvi    tells about skinny s absence    i hunted for skinny for a couple of hours  but i couldn t find him  i  went all the way into leeds for i couldn t think where else he d be  if  he wasn t around camp  but he wasn t in the village  that was sure  and  i began to get kind of anxious  because i knew the crazy state he was  in  and besides he was soaked from being in the lake     it cleared up nice and sunny while i was gone and when i got back to  camp  everybody was getting ready for supper  i had to change my  clothes  they were so wet  and while i was doing it mr  ellsworth came  into our cabin and asked me if i knew where skinny was     i said   no  i don t  i hiked all over looking for him  but i couldn t  find him  that s how i got so wet i should think connie would have his  patrol out hunting for him      mr  ellsworth and i walked over to supper together  and he seemed kind  of worried   i m afraid this thing has jarred his balance a little    that s what he said      one reason he wants to be alone   i said   is because he hasn t got  any friends       i think his patrol is very proud of him   he said   the whole camp is  proud of him       they re proud of what he  did   they couldn t help being proud of it    i said   but they re not proud of  him   why don t they take him in and  make friends with him  he s won the gold cross for them  gee  the least  they can do is to show some interest in him  are they ashamed of him   they don t even trust him  that s what  i  think      mr  ellsworth said   yes  he s won the gold cross for them  no doubt of  that       yes   i said   and where is he now  he s gone off so s he can be  alone  one fellow around here says everybody in camp thinks he s a  thief       oh  i guess he didn t say just that  roy   mr  ellsworth said  very  nice like   but we ve got to have a little talk with skinny about the  way he talks  the things he says  he s a very queer youngster  they see  he s different from the rest of us  that he s out of the slums and   well  they don t understand him  that s all       he just blurts everything out   i said   that s all       well  he  mustn t    mr  ellsworth laughed   especially when he s out  on the lake  his tirade to day  after the rescue  sounded very strange   the boys are not used to hearing talk about picking pockets and  stealing silverware  they don t understand it       i should worry about them   i said   skinny s just a kind of a freak   look at the way he wanted to go away and be alone by himself  doesn t  that prove it       well   mr  ellsworth said   it will be more to the point if he comes  back all right       it would be more to the point if the elks were out hunting for him   i  said  you can bet i wasn t afraid to say it  to mr  ellsworth or  anybody else      i think we ll have to organize a search if he doesn t show up soon    mr  ellsworth said  then neither of us said anything for a few seconds      how about the camping fellow   i asked him      they took him home in a skiff   mr  ellsworth said   he wanted to go   so three of the boys rowed him across after the weather cleared       i don t see how skinny held him up  i just don t   i told mr   ellsworth     mr  ellsworth said   no  it was marvelous any way you look at it  i  think skinny nearly broke the poor fellow s jaw  there is wonderful  power in frantic desperation      anyway  at supper all the fellows were shouting about skinny  everybody  said he d have the gold cross  even uncle jeb and mr  elting  and you  never hear mr  elting saying much about those things till he s sure   all the elks were shouting about the gold cross and where they d keep  it  just as if it was theirs  hardly any of them said anything about  skinny     at camp fire it was just the same only more so  and i noticed across  the fire that mr  ellsworth and a couple of the scoutmasters were  talking together and i guessed they were deciding about getting a  searching party started     pretty soon bert winton came over and squatted down alongside of me    kind of hot on the other side   he said   flame blows right in your  face  these fellows all in your patrol      i told him   yes   and then i said   mostly we hang together       good idea   he said   any news of the little codger        i  couldn t find him   i said  kind of mad like      guess he didn t go far   he said   just wanted to get off by himself  and think it over  natural enough  didn t hit his tracks  did you      i said   nope       stole a march on you   he said      oh  sure  he stole a couple of marches   i said   maybe he even stole  a look       well  he stole away   winton said   he ll be back      cracky  i couldn t make heads or tails of that fellow  somehow i kind  of liked him  i couldn t help it         chapter xvii    tells about camp fire and skinny    all of a sudden i heard a fellow shout   there he is   and then  everbody around the camp fire set up a howl     skinny was standing in the dark away from the fire  just as if he was  afraid to come in among the fellows  his uniform was all wrinkled and  stained and he looked even worse than he did other times  there was a  long mark on his cheek where i guess the gold dust twin had scratched  him  and he didn t have his hat or his shoes   good night   he didn t  look much like pictures you see of heroes  but he was all quieted down   that was one thing  i guess he was played out      there he is  the crazy little indian   a fellow shouted   come in  here  skinny  till we get our fists on you  you ve won the gold cross   you little spindle shanks      then a lot of fellows shouted   hurrah for skinny  come here  skinny   till we pat you on the back  you little water snake   they didn t even  seem to know his last name or his front name either  and it made me  mad      you trot right over here to mamma  skinny   vic norris of the elks  shouted   we ll take care of  you       the kid was smiling  all confused  as if he didn t know  what  to do      come ahead over  don t be scared   connie bennett shouted  so then  skinny went over  kind of bashful and staring all around him  and sat  down with the elk patrol     westy leaned over and whispered to me    can you beat that   his own  patrol leader telling him not to be afraid to go and sit down with his  own patrol  i ll fix that bunch   he said     then he stood right up and shouted  oh  boy  you ought to have heard  him  he said   let s give three cheers for alfred mccord  of the  st  bridgeboro troop  b s a   the second fellow to win the gold cross in  his troop and the first one to win it in his patrol  the  only  one in  his patrol that  could  win it      oh  boy  that was some whack     well  you should have heard the fellows shout for skinny  merry  christmas  but that was some noise  they all stood up  the elks too   and gave him the biggest send off  i  ever heard at temple camp  even  the scoutmasters and the trustees joined in and old uncle jeb kept  shouting    hooo  ray  hooo  ray    cracky  you would have laughed if  you d heard him  oh  bibbie  when temple camp once gets started  the  west front in france is sleepy hollow compared to it     and oh  didn t it make me feel good to see skinny  he looked as if he  was going to start to run away  but connie had him by the collar  and  all the elks were laughing  and now i could see they were proud of him   anyway     then mr  ellsworth held up his hand and as soon as the racket died  down  he began to speak  this is what he said  because mr  barrows   he s a trustee  knows shorthand  and afterwards he gave it to me all  written out to copy in our troop book  he said      scouts  you have heard that speech is silver and silence is golden  i  think this kind of shouting is highest grade sterling silver  it is  chunks of silver  as one might say  but since this is a matter of the  gold cross  i ask for just a moment or two of golden silence  while i  speak to you  i see about me  scouts from ohio  and michigan  and new  hampshire        and hoboken   pee wee piped out  jiminy  that kid is the limit      yes  and hoboken   mr  ellsworth said  trying not to laugh   i speak  to all of you from north  south  east and west        one of them has been up in an airplane  too   pee wee yelled      i speak to all scouts here   mr  ellsworth said   whether they come  from the heavens above or from the earth beneath or from the waters  under the earth  that will include any scout who may happen to have  been in a submarine  will that do   and he gave pee wee an awful funny  look     then he said   i want to thank you all for the tribute you have paid  our troop in its moment of pride and honor  this little scout is brand  new  he is not even out of the tenderfoot class  and the gold cross  award for heroism will be his  i think that every scout of his patrol  should thrill with pride at this thought  i dare say we all find him a  little strange   we  as well as  you   and i m afraid he is a kind of  law unto himself  if you understand what i mean  but this beautiful  cross which will soon be his will bring him closer to us all  i am  sure  it is said in our handbook that a scout is a brother to every  other scout  so he has many thousands of brothers all over this broad  land  the gold cross is very bright  look in it and you will see your  face reflected  you will see the scout smile  and that is brighter than  any gold      the best of all  it reflects honor  honor on him who wears it  honor  on his patrol  on his troop and on every troop and scout in this whole  great camp  and alfred mccord has brought us this honor  come here   alf  my boy  and let me shake your hand      wasn t that a peach of an address     but i noticed that skinny didn t move  he just stood there close to  connie bennett he was shaking all over and he was smiling and he was  crying  i saw hunt ward jump up and give him a rap on the back and he  was so little and so thin  that it kind of made him stagger     then he said   can t i stay here with them      oh  boy  wasn t i glad         chapter xviii    tells about my talk with bert winton    believe  me   that was  some  night  i guess i knew how skinny felt  when he scooted off  because after camp fire i felt just that same way  myself  christmas  i don t know how it feels to win the gold cross  and  i guess i never will either  but just the same  after camp fire that  night  i just felt as if i wanted to go and be by myself  i can t tell  you why     it s fine hanging around the camp fire after it s died down  but  they re pretty sure to chase you off to bed if you do that  it s a  danger zone  believe  me   anyway  i know a peach of a place on a big  rock near the shore  you just go along under the spring board and pass  the boat landing and follow the path  so i went there and pretty soon  hunt ward came along on his way to the elk cabin  and he stopped a  couple of minutes and talked to me      well   he said   we ve got that little old medal in our patrol       you ve got alf in your patrol  you mean   i said      i don t know whether you could exactly say he  earned  it   he said    because he was crazy and didn t know what he was doing       i wish i knew some more fellows who were crazy like that   i told him      you seem to be kind of sore at us  foxy   he said  most of them called  me foxy  because i m leader of the silver foxes      there s a difference between a mascot and a regular friend   i told  him   you fellows treat skinny just as if he was a sort of a mascot   why don t you take him in with you  just like you would any other  fellow       he s a queer little duck   hunt said      that isn t any reason why you shouldn t take him in  i m not saying  you haven t   now   and i m glad if you have  that s sure  you ought to  read him the handbook and teach him some of the other stuff  the laws  and all that  gee  that s the least you could do  now he s won the  cross for you       grandpa foxy   he said  and then he went along toward the elk cabin     i was just going to start off to our own cabin when i heard footsteps   it seemed as if someone might be stealing along  and first i thought it  might be skinny  i was glad it wasn t  because i wanted him to stay in  with his own fellows now and not bother with me     it was bert winton      h lo  blakeley   he said  in that quiet kind of a way he has   i  thought everybody was in bed       i see  you re  not in bed   i told him  kind of grouchy     he said   me  oh  no  i always prowl around after fox trails and  things  i got on one fox trail  didn t i  bet the kid won t sleep  to night  hey       i bet i won t sleep either   i said   and that s why i m here       kind of like the kid  don t you   he said     i said   yes  and that s more than  you  can say      he just looked at me a minute and then he sat down on the stone  alongside of me  and he broke a stick off a bush and began marking on  the ground with it  then he said  kind of as if he didn t take much  interest  he said   actions speak louder than words  did you ever hear  that       sure   i said   but i d like to know what that has to do with skinny      he just kept pushing the stick around  then he said   if you re such a  good friend of his  instead of trotting all around and sticking your  face into every cabin like an old maid hunting for a thimble  why  didn t you find his trail and follow it      i said   i don t know why i didn t      if you thought he just went off to be by himself  why didn t you trail  him and make sure   he asked me  all the while very friendly and quiet  like      well  if he wanted to be by himself   i said   why should i track  him       why should you hunt for him at all  then   he said      just because i choose to   i told him      that s a good reason   he said      it s all the reason you ll get   i blurted out      all right   he said  very nice and polite   only then don t go around  thinking you re a better friend to him than i am  i know this camp and  i know those fellows across the lake and i know page fifty one of the  handbook  and i ve seen the kid once or twice       i suppose you think i don t know what s on page fifty one of the  handbook   i said  getting mad   it s the tracking badge  pathfinding    so there  and i see you have it on your sleeve  too       that s where it belongs   he said      well  then  if you think it was so important to track him  why didn t  you track him   i blurted at him  for i was good and mad      i did   he said         chapter xix    tells about a visit from across the lake    now at last i knew for sure that i hated that fellow  and i said to  myself   you can bet i ll never have anything more to do with  him       when i got to our cabin all the fellows were asleep  except westy  and  i said to him   do you know that scout who s patrol leader in the ohio  troop      he said   you mean winton       that s him   i said   i hate him so much that it makes me hate the  whole state of ohio  i wouldn t even go canoeing on the ohio river      he didn t say anything  i guess he was sleepy   i even hate the  baltimore and ohio railroad   i said     the next morning just as we were going in for a swim  we saw the canoe  coming across the lake again  when it got near enough  we could see  that another fellow was in it  we all went over to the landing to ask  him how his pal was getting along  right away he asked if he could see  mr  ellsworth     i said   sure you can  i guess he s in the tepee  writing      i felt sort of glad  because i thought probably it meant something good  for skinny  all morning he was sure one hero  and at the time the  camper came he was off with the elks somewhere  stalking i guess  and i  was mighty glad of it     the tepee is a little tent where the scoutmasters always go when they  want to be alone  so as to write up troop stuff  nobody ever bothers  them in there unless it s important  and even then only one fellow  goes     i said   sure  come ahead  i ll find him for you      he was a pretty nice fellow  i could see that  even if he  was  a  tenderfoot  and he spoke mighty friendly  sort of  to me     he said   you have a wonderful little life saver here  with a bull dog  grip       it s more than a grip   i said   it s a regular suitcase  he s going  to get the highest award we have  too       bully for him   he said   we re going to let him know what we think  about it  too       scouts aren t allowed to take anything for things like that   i told  him      well   he said   we heard him shouting on the lake the other night  that he d like to own a canoe  so we re going to give him ours when we  go away next week       oh  boy   i said  then i just happened to think to say   did you hear  all he shouted out on the lake  because   i said   he s kind of  kind  of freakish  sometimes       he s a little wonder  that s what he is   he said     when we got to the tepee  mr  ellsworth jumped up and shook hands with  him and said   glad to see you  sit down  sit down too  roy      so we both sat down on the bench  and i don t know  it seemed to me as  if the fellow was sort of uncomfortable  as if he d rather i wouldn t  be there  but he didn t say anything about it     mr  ellsworth said   your friend had a very narrow escape  canoes are  bad things in storms  you should be careful   and then he gave him some  mighty good advice in that nice way he has     the camping fellow said he d come to thank the little fellow  that s  what he called him  and to tell mr  ellsworth how they both felt about  it  he said they d never forget about it  and he wanted to know if  there was anything they could do      absolutely nothing   mr  ellsworth said   all awards and tokens of  recognition are attended to right here among ourselves      for about half a minute the fellow didn t say anything and i thought he  was thinking about how to spring that about the canoe  because it  wasn t easy after what mr  ellsworth said  then he said  i can tell you  almost just the very words  because mr  ellsworth helped me with this  part  he said      there s a little matter i want to speak about  mr  ellsworth  and it  isn t easy  my friend didn t want me to speak about it at all  for he  was afraid you might misunderstand us      mr  ellsworth said  awful friendly like   i will try not to      then he said  kind of smiling   i suppose we can trust this good little  scout not to repeat out talk to anyone      mr  ellsworth began to laugh  then he said   oh  yes  indeed  all good  little scouts are to be trusted  that s what roy  here  would say is  their middle name  am i right  roy      i guess that made it kind of easy for the fellow  for he started right  in  though i could see it was hard for him to say it  he said   my pal  had quite a little sum of money in his jacket  which we can t seem to  find now  it was buttoned into a flap pocket  he thought  or rather  i   thought  that perhaps it had been taken from him and laid away for safe  keeping  or perhaps it may have fallen into the water and gone down   there s a lot of valuable stuff under the water these days   i think he  said that just so s to kind of make a joke about what he was saying  so  as maybe it wouldn t seem so serious like  anyway  he was awfully  trice   it seems pretty contemptible to be talking about money   he  said   after my pal s life was saved by you folks  but it s just  because the money has to be paid out pretty soon that he s worrying  about it  he didn t want me to come over and ask  but i told him i was  going to  anyway  no harm in that  i guess       none whatever   mr  ellsworth said   how much money was there      the fellow said a little over two hundred  but they weren t sure  exactly how much     mr  ellsworth raised his eyebrows in that way he has and said   isn t  that a good deal of money for two young fellows to take camping      the camper said   yes  i guess it is  but we re pretty punk campers  i  suppose  any way you look at it      mr  ellsworth said   just wait a minute   and he went away     the camping fellow started to say how it made him feel mean and  contemptible to come over and ask about the money  and he guessed it  was probably in davy jones  locker  anyway     pretty soon mr  ellsworth came back and said   i m very sorry  my young  friend  but no sum of money was found on your companion  if it had  been  it would either have been restored to him or held by the camp  authorities through oversight  i have just made inquiries of them  the  boy who saved your friend is not in camp at present  but i think i can  answer for him  that he did not find it  to make sure  i will ask him  when he returns and one of the boys will row over and let you know      i could see the fellow seemed kind of disappointed  but anyway  he was  mighty nice about it         chapter xx    tells about the loss of some money    mr  ellsworth asked me to come back and get some letters to put in the  mail box  so after i saw the gold dust twin start off i went back to  the tepee  and just as i was going inside i saw connie bennett and bert  mcalpin and hunt ward and stut moran and skinny coming down the hill in  back of the tepee  skinny was smiling all over and i could see the  wrinkles at the ends of his mouth like i always could when he smiled   that s when you could see how thin he was  i shouted that i thought mr   ellsworth wanted to see him and he started to run  only connie grabbed  him by the collar  just for fun  and held him back  i heard him say    take your time  we re all in on this      by that i knew that skinny expected mr  ellsworth was going to give him  the gold cross  i didn t blame  him  for thinking so  but the others  might have had better sense  because it s usually a week  anyway   before an honor medal comes     anyway  they all came down into the tepee and stood looking around as  if they expected to see the gold cross on the table  hanged if i don t  think connie had n idea that mr  ellsworth would hand it to  him   he  looked so important like     mr  ellsworth just went on and finished the letter he was writing  then  he said   alfred  our rescued mariner from across the lake can t find a  roll of money he had in his mackinaw  he thinks it may have gone down  in the lake  don t happen to know anything about it  do you      i have to admit that i felt sort of funny and i looked pretty close at  skinny  he just stood there staring and i could see by his neck that he  was breathing hard and all nervous sort of  then mr  ellsworth asked  him again  very pleasant like he always spoke to him  but skinny didn t  say a word  only stood there staring and he gulped as if he was trying  to swallow something  gee  i was all kind of shaky myself now  because  i saw mr  ellsworth looked at him in a funny way  like a fellow looks  at the sun  kind of  as if he was studying him   you  know     then connie said   why in the dickens don t you speak up  skinny  if  you know anything about it  why don t you say so  do you want to get us  all in dutch      i could see that skinny was just trying as hard as he could to speak   but couldn t on account of that lump in his throat  i know it was none  of my business  but i just couldn t keep still any longer  so i said  right out      the reason he doesn t speak is because he  can t   haven t you got  sense enough to see that  he thought mr  ellsworth was going to hand  him the medal and you were crazy enough to let him think so  that s one  reason he s all rattled  so i ll answer for him and i hope that ll  satisfy you  he hasn t got the money and he never saw it and he never  heard of it  it s down at the bottom of black lake  that s where it is   don t you suppose he had something better to do with himself when he  was saving that gold dust twin  than to be going through his pockets       i m sure i would   vic norris said       you    i said   you couldn t even have held him up in the water and  you know plaguy well you couldn t  there s not one of you that could   if you thought more about what he was doing out there in all that storm  with his teeth in that fellow s sweater and his hand being blamed near  bitten off  it would be better for  you   all  you re  thinking about  is getting the gold cross into your patrol  what do you suppose  he   cares about money  a fellow that can do things like that  it s these  jelly fish that go camping with a whole savings bank in their pockets  and no shovel to dig a drain ditch with  that s the kind that think  about money  you make me sick  turn your pockets inside out  alf  and  let them see what you ve got  go ahead      all the while mr  ellsworth kept saying   shh  shh  roy   but what did  i care  even he couldn t stop me      what s  he  got to do with it  anyway   connie said to mr  ellsworth    i don t see as it s any of  his  business       well   i said   i ll  make  it my business  you ve got the kid so  nervous and scared  that he can t even find his pockets  he        just a moment  roy   mr  ellsworth said   you mustn t forget yourself   you have done our friends across the lake an injustice       when i get through doing skinny  justice   it will be time enough to  think of  them    i said  oh  boy  i was mad     mr  ellsworth said   we have no wish to search alfred  roy  why all  this anger       because i ve heard enough hints and insinuations around this camp   that s why   i said  jiminy  i could just feel my voice tremble     poor skinny was fumbling at one of his pockets and he was so scared and  nervous  that he couldn t get his hand in even  so i just stepped over  and pulled his pocket inside out      illustration  i stepped over and pulled his pockets inside out       four pennies   i said   see  poor but honest  hey  alf   and i gave  him a good rap on the shoulder  i guess it made him feel good  because  he smiled at me even though he did look scared     then one after another i pulled all his other pockets inside out  and  last i turned out the flap pockets in his khaki shirt  just as i did  that  a key fell out      four cents and a key   i said   now are you satisfied       we never said he had it   hunt ward spoke up      well  now you can see he hasn t anyway   i said     all the while mr  ellsworth waited just as if he didn t have much use  for all this business  but just the same wouldn t interfere  that s  always the way he is  so now he said  very pleasant      i think we re having a sort of tempest in a teapot  roy  no one has  made any accusations  suppose you let me say a word  it wasn t at all  necessary to perform this operation on alfred  let me see this key   alf  my boy      skinny handed the key to mr  ellsworth and he screwed up his face  sort  of funny  and looked at it  then he said   hmph  it s a yale key   belonging to a padlock  eh  what key is it  my boy      skinny could hardly speak he was so scared  even i felt sort of shaky    i don t know why     skinny just said   i found it       here in camp  you mean   mr  ellsworth said  just as nice as i ever  heard him talk  awful pleasant and easy  like      on the boat   skinny said   the day i found the money  it was right on  the deck       that was the money he gave you   i said  i just couldn t help saying  it     mr  ellsworth said   now  roy  you must let me do the talking  just be  quiet a minute      i said   excuse me       now  alf   mr  ellsworth said   why didn t you give me this key  eh      skinny kept breathing  but could hardly speak     then he said   i put it in the other pocket  i forgot  mostly i don t  put things there       i see   mr  ellsworth said  just as if he believed every word   you  don t know what key it is  i suppose  alf       no  sir   he said  and then he gulped and seemed terribly scared and  excited      all right   mr  ellsworth said   just leave it with me  i expect i  shall be able to pin the cross on you in a few days  alf  have a little  patience      then  all of a sudden skinny blurted out   am i a hero       yes  indeed   mr  ellsworth said  and he smiled at him and patted his  shoulder         chapter xxi    tells about my talk with mr  ellsworth    after they were gone  mr  ellsworth told me that i shouldn t get so  excited about nothing  i have to admit that s the way i often do     i said   do you know what that s a key to      he said   it s a key to a padlock  i have an idea that perhaps it fits  the padlock on that locker in the house boat  the one that was always  locked      jiminy  i never thought of that until just then when he spoke about it   it made me feel awfully queer  anyhow  i guessed right off that he was  right  because probably it fell out of lieutenant donnelle s pocket  along with the change that he spilled all over the deck  there was a  kind of a lump in  my  throat now     i said   skinny gave you the money so we ought to believe him when he  says he just put the key in another pocket and forgot about it       why  surely   he said   i m not suspecting him of anything  neither is  anyone else  the only thing that puzzles me is  how the key happened to  be on the deck where he found it  we swabbed the decks so thoroughly  before leaving bridgeboro  one of our boys might have dropped some  change and never known it but how did the key happen to be there  we  know how it happened in alfred s pocket  but how did it happen on the  deck  we scouts claim to be observant  and yet that key was right on  the deck from bridgeboro all the way down to st  george  that s the  queer thing      oh  boy  didn t i feel guilty  especially i felt guilty because mr   ellsworth was so nice and pleasant about it  because all the while i  knew where that key came from  and it seemed just like lying not to  tell  gee  i was kind of sorry now that i promised lieutenant donnelle  that i would never tell about him coming there  i couldn t say  anything  so i just kept still     all the while mr  ellsworth kept looking at the key and thinking and  humming a tune to himself  pretty soon he said   you don t happen to  know where alfred went when he disappeared  do you  roy      i said   no  i don t  all i know is i couldn t find him       he was gone for four or five hours   he said  very slow  as if he was  sort of thinking     i guess i felt just about the same as skinny did now  anyway  i was all  shaky and it was hard for me to get started saying anything     then i said   mr  ellsworth  skinny went off because he was all scared  and excited  and he wanted to be all alone by himself  often i ve felt  that same way  i felt that way after i passed my second class tests  i  don t deny he s kind of freaky  i think he just went off in the woods   you know yourself it s in the handbook that trees are good companions   he just wanted to be alone  i bet he wasn t a hundred yards from camp   skinny s kind of queer  you know that      then mr  ellsworth just laid down the key and put stamps on two or  three letters and said  all right  roy  just see that these get mailed   will you      he didn t say what he was going to do and i guessed he wasn t going to  do anything  and even suppose he did  what was the harm     but just the same i felt awful queer and shaky  i guess maybe it was  because i couldn t come right out and tell him the plain truth about  that key         chapter xxii    tells about how i visited the ohio troop s cabin    one thing i was sure of  and that was that skinny went away into the  woods just to be alone by himself  like he said  i knew it was just  like him to do that  maybe you ll think it was funny for him to do that  when it was raining  but already he was good and wet  you have to  remember that  i said to myself   i should worry about the key  because  anyway  that had nothing to do with skinny   but just the same i kept  worrying about something  i don t know just what     pretty soon i made up my mind to do something that i didn t want to do   i went up the hill to where the ohio troop bunked  they had one of the  big troop cabins that holds two patrols  i guess they were a pretty  fine troop  because they had everything fixed up dandy  one patrol was  called the royal bengal tigers  and the other was called the african  tigers  and both patrols wore yellow scarfs with black stripes  and all  their scout staffs had tigers  heads on them  even when they dived from  the spring board they had a certain kind of a way of jumping  they  called it the tiger spring  and nobody could get the hang of it  some  organization they had  that s what mr  ellsworth said  every one of  those fellows had a tiger claw hung around his neck  oh  boy  that was  some troop for you     i asked one of the fellows for bert winton  and he came around from  behind the cabin where he was spearing papers and leaves  i said     you  fellows ought to be called the gold dust twins  your two patrols  i mean  because you re so plaguy particular  picking up leaves and  everything  you ll be dusting the roof next      he said   we re a lot of old maids up here      then he climbed up on the cabin roof and sat on the peak and i  scrambled up too  and sat down alongside of him  honest  that fellow  would squat in the funniest places  and always he had a stick with him      nice and breezy up here   he said  in that quiet  easy sort of way he  had   and we can scan the horizon  anything particular      i don t know  but i seemed to sort of feel that he knew what i was  going to talk about  and i guess he just scrambled up there so the  other fellows wouldn t hear  cracky  that fellow always had his wits  about him  that s one sure thing     i said   i don t deny that i was kind of sore at you when you spoke to  me down at the lake  and i can t tell whether i like you or not   because i can never make out what you really think  you ve got to know  what a fellow thinks before you know whether you like him or not  don t  you      he said you sure did  and then he said   well  i know whether i like   you  or not  so it s all right       i don t care much whether you like  me   i said   it s skinny i m  thinking about  i know i like  him   you can bet       and that s one reason i like you   he said   because you like  him    ever notice how the cedar shingles shrink in a dry spell      i said i didn t know they were cedar      you can always tell cedar by the smell   he said   and the s warp    gee  i didn t even know what an s warp was     then i said right out  i said   you told me that you tracked skinny   would you mind telling me where he went      for a minute he just kept moving the stick around and then he said    what would be the use of telling you       because i ve got a reason and i want to know   i said  then all of a  sudden i knew why he climbed up there  it was partly so he could see  all around and be sure no one was coming      well  why do you want to know   he said      because i m a friend of skinny s  that s why   i said  then i just  blurted out   i might as well tell you because  anyway  you re smarter  than i am  they found a key on skinny      he just said   when       to day   i said   and it s probably a key to one of the lockers in our  house boat  besides  that fellow who nearly got drowned had about a  couple of hundred dollars on him       humph  i thought so   winton said     i said   why       oh  just because   he said   the day he came over to try to buy a  fishing pole he had a roll as big as a cobblestone with him  i  suspected he d lose it some day and that somebody would get blamed       nobody is getting blamed   i said      no  but somebody is being suspected   he shot back      well  he  did  lose it  i have to admit that much   i said      and that s all you re ever going to admit  hey   he said  all the  while moving the stick around on the roof       you    bet    your    sweet    life   that s all i m ever going to  admit   i said      bully for you   he said   you re about the best little scout i ever  knew  next to skinny       i can stick up for a friend  that s one thing   i said      through thick and thin   he asked me   in spite of circumstantial  evidence       i should worry about circumstantial evidence   i told him   why should  i care about circumstantial evidence  what did circumstantial evidence  ever do for  me   i d like to know      then he began to laugh  gee   i  didn t know what he was laughing at      nothing would shake you  huh   he said      believe me  it would take an earthquake   i told him     he looked all around and moved the stick around on the shingles  as if  he was thinking     then he said   well  skinny went over to the hudson to that house boat  you fellows came up on  he followed the old bed of bowl valley creek   now don t get excited  he had as much right to go there as you have  he  was all worked up  and he isn t just exactly right in his head  you  know that  he just wanted to go home and be all alone by himself  the  house boat was the only home he knew  i didn t go on the boat  because  i had no right to  and because there was no need to  i didn t know he  had any key  i don t believe he hid anything  if that s what you re  thinking about  i tracked him because i wanted to make sure he was safe  and know what he was doing  as soon as i saw where he was headed for  i  just beat it back  nothing to it  blakeley  don t worry       but now you know he had a key to a locker   i said     he just said   well  what of it  i believe in him and there you are  i  wouldn t care if he had keys to all the banks and safe deposit vaults  in the united states      gee  it just kind of gave me a thrill  the way he spoke  i said    anyway  now i know that i like you  i ought to have had sense enough  to know before      then he said   you see  blakeley  skinny s a mighty queer little  proposition  if it wasn t for that scoutmaster you fellows have  i d  say he would never make a regular tip top scout  but i think that mr   what s his name  ellsworth  is a wonder       believe me  you said something   i told him      you know yourself   he said   how that kid talks  shouts  i mean   stealing silver  picking pockets  what are all these fellows to think   most of the fellows here come from good folks  they don t understand a  poor little codger like skinny who is half crazy  because he s been  half starved  you know yourself that he doesn t fit in here  i don t  say he isn t going to  but i m good at arithmetic  blakeley        gee  you re a peach on tracking  too   i said      well  and i know how to put two and two together   he said   i knew  i  just felt it in my bones  that that gold dust twin with his swell  bathing suit and his waterproof mackinaw was going to lose his roll in  the water  he carried it loose in his mackinaw pocket  a camper  mind  you  he had a wad big enough to pay off the national debt  and i knew  it would tumble out and it did  skinny s one of those poor little  codgers that s always unlucky  he happened to be there  he happened to  have a key  he happened to go to the house boat  i got hold of his  tracks just because i didn t want him to come to any harm while he was  all worked up  the reason i didn t say anything about where he went  was  because there are a whole lot of fellows in this camp that would  put two and two together and get five  understand  they d say he went  to hide goldie s freight shipment of dollar bills  so i kept still  no  harm in keeping still       oh  cracky   i said   but i like you   i m  keeping still about  something too and you can bet i know how to keep my mouth shut  you can  just bet i d do anything for a friend  i would       well  skinny s got a good friend   he said      i didn t mean skinny   i told him   but he has got two good friends   anyway  and that s us  hey      he just said   that s us   and then he slid right down the roof and  jumped off the edge  awful funny like         chapter xxiii    tells about how i did a good turn    that night mr  ellsworth wasn t at camp fire and nobody knew where he  was  all the time i had a funny feeling and i kept looking away from  the fire and up the dark path to see if he was coming  i wasn t  listening to the yarns at all     and that night i didn t sleep  i just kind of felt that something was  wrong  you know what i mean  i could just feel it in the air  the next  morning was nice and bright and sunny and it seemed good  because there  had been such a lot of rain lately  on my way over to breakfast  i  stopped outside of council shack to read the bulletin board and see  what was on for the day  i saw that the elks were going stalking  and i  was glad of that  because i knew skinny liked stalking and i was glad  he was with them at last  but just the same i felt kind of funny all  the while i was having eats     afterward artie van arlen  he s head of the ravens  came and told me  that mr  ellsworth wanted to see me  i felt awful shaky  when i went  into council shack he was sitting there all alone  and on the table  right in front of him were the key and a lot of money all crunched up   oh  but didn t mr  ellsworth look sober and serious     he said very low as if he was all discouraged sort of   roy   he said    you said something about going home for your sister s birthday      i said   yes  sir  i d like to go down friday and come back monday   i ll go both ways by train  because that s quicker  i won t go if it  isn t all right  but marjorie is going to have a graduation party and  they re going to have cocoanut cake  but anyway  i don t care so much  about that   but  oh  boy  cocoanut cake is my middle name     he said kind of slow  sort of  as if he was trying to make up his mind    well  roy  i have an idea i ll let you take little mccord home  i  don t know what else to do with him  i m afraid he s too much for me   you see there are a good many boys who have to be considered  this  isn t much of a place for a campaign of reformation   that s just what  he said     i said   are you mad at skinny      he said   i m not mad  roy  but i m disheartened  a little hopeless   i m afraid  i m willing to believe that he isn t just right in his  head  but you see i can t help him  i m not a doctor  his heroism is  just a phase of his condition  he gets excited   that s just exactly  what mr  ellsworth said  because i remember  then he just lifted the  money and dropped it again  it was all crunched up and damp sort of   even where i stood near him i could smell how it was damp  you know   kind of mildewed      alfred went down to the house boat and hid this in the locker   mr   ellsworth said   the key he had fitted the padlock and he must have  known that  it s the right sum  as nearly as our friend across the lake  remembered what he had  a little over two hundred dollars  seven  dollars over  it s a miserable piece of business  roy  i ve been lying  awake thinking it over all night  and i guess the best thing is to send  the poor little wretch home  i ll send a letter to mr  benton about  him  he ll get him into some institution  maybe we can help him later   he s a little young for us   then he began whistling to himself and  drumming on the table     gee  i just stood there watching him and i didn t know what to say  i  wondered what bert winton would say if he were there in my place     pretty soon i said   maybe i won t go home to my sister s birthday  after all  gee  i don t care so much about cocoanut cake anyway   he  just didn t say anything  only kept drumming and whistling     then i said   did you say anything to connie and the elks       no   he said   but i shall  they ll have to know why i take him out of  their patrol  they ll have to know what he did      for a couple of minutes i couldn t say anything at all  and i just  stood there gulping  one thing  no fellow can stand up and say that i  ever talked back to mr  ellsworth  no  siree  no fellow can say that   but i just happened to think of something i wanted to say and so as  soon as i could get started  i said it right out  this is what i said      mr  ellsworth  you always said a scout ought to stand up for a fellow  through thick and thin  no matter what  because we re all brothers  and  that s what bert winton thinks too  you know it says in the handbook  how we re all brothers  so skinny is my brother and i should worry  about my sister s racket  i ve got a week s extra time due me at the  camp  on account of twelve snapshots last season   footnote  it was the  rule at temple camp that any scout obtaining twelve good snapshots of  birds  should have a week at camp in addition to his regular time  and  this he could transfer to another scout as a good turn   editor   so  i ve decided i ll give that to skinny  i suppose that if the trustees  say he s a thief they can send him away  no matter what  but the  trustees don t have any meeting till next wednesday  maybe you ll be  willing to tell me how i can go and register skinny for that week of  mine  because i don t know how to do it  if they want to say he s a  thief let them go ahead and do it  but anyway  i should worry  they  can t do it before next wednesday and his week will be up then  and  that will give me a chance to prove he didn t do it      mr  ellsworth smiled  kind of  and shook his head  then he just sat  looking at me  he said   roy  you ought to make a good lawyer when you  grow up  you have put one over on your scoutmaster   i guess he wasn t  mad  anyway he said  awful nice like   go over to the administration  rooms in the pavilion and see the record clerk  i won t interfere  my  boy      gee  i was afraid i had made him sore  kind of  but when i was going  out i could see that he was just sitting there smiling at me     anyway  i bet you d have done the same thing  if you d been me         chapter xxiv    tells about how i told a secret    i don t know how it got out  but inside of an hour every fellow in that  camp knew  i bet mr  ellsworth never said anything  maybe somebody went  with him to the house boat  or maybe somebody followed him  hey  but  that s always the way it is at temple camp  things get out     the first thing i did was to go straight to see bert winton  i said    i ve got something to tell you  can you come out alone   because   honest  that fellow was so popular he could never get away from his  troop     he said   come on out on the lake for a row      so we went down to the landing and on the way a couple of fellows asked  us if we d heard about little skinny  anyway  we didn t pay any  attention to them  one fellow who belonged in a troop from boston   said   i hear his patrol isn t going to bother with him any more      i said to bert  that s what i called him now  i said   if that was  true about the money  he wouldn t get the gold cross  would he      he said   nope  i guess not  bravery doesn t count for much if a fellow  is crooked  a highwayman is brave if it comes to that      by that i knew that there s a lot to being a hero besides just being  brave  crinkums  i learned a lot of things from that fellow      but as long as he didn t do it  we should worry   i told him      that s us   he said    when we got in the boat he took the oars and i sat in the stern and we  just flopped around  there aren t many fellows out rowing mornings   because they re either tracking or stalking or cleaning up or maybe in  for a dip  we could see the fellows busy about the cabins and hear them  shouting and it made me feel awful sorry for skinny  somehow  i didn t  see him anywheres and i wondered where he was      well  kid   bert said  most always he called me that    things get  worser and worser  hey       do you still say he didn t do it   i asked him   i don t know  what   to think  look at that money       ever take a good look at skinny   he said      yes  but look at the money   i said      what do i want to look at it for   he said   it ought to be hung out  on the clothesline from all i ve heard   he said     oh  boy  i was glad to hear him say that   i wouldn t let any fellow in  this camp except you call me  kid    that s what i told him     he just rowed around a little while  making dandy feather strokes  and  then he said      mr  ellsworth didn t send that money over to daniel boone and buffalo  bill yet  did he      i said   you mean the gold dust twins  no  i don t think he did      he said   well then  we ve got to fix  that  and we can t ask mr  e   not to do it the tide s against us  kid  nobody s going to listen to  us  not yet      then all of a sudden he sat up  got his oars set right  and oh  bibbie   you should have seen that fellow row  every stroke he took he almost  lay down flat  and oh  christmas  couldn t he feather  pretty soon we  were over near the shore where the campers were  you could see their  tent in among the trees      you re not going to tell  them   are you   i said     but he didn t answer me  only just called out   hey  there  you wild  indians      one of them came through the woods and stopped and looked at us      aren t you fellows going to the boat races down at catskill   winton  shouted   you re going to miss the time of your lives if you don t   better get a hustle       what time are they   the camper shouted      just about now   bert shouted   follow the old bowl creek bed and  you ll get there quicker   then he rowed away again   that ll fix  em  for to day   he said   more than one way to kill a cat  hey       there  are  some races  aren t there   i asked him      sure there are  that pair won t get back till midnight if they once  hit catskill      i said   you think of everything  don t you       now  blakeley   he said  kind of more serious like  while he rowed  around   what are we going to do about it  skinny didn t take the  money  that s settled  all right then  who did  nobody  correct  be  seated  all right then  what became of it  mr  david jones has it  our  old college chum  davy  it s at the bottom of black lake  how do i know  all this  because i know young mackinaw jacket and because i know  skinny  see  simple as eating pie       gee  i ve got to admit that eating pie is easy  especially mince   i  told him     he said   all right  now i m going to ask you a question and if you  want to  you can say  none of your business   you told me you were  keeping still about something  has it anything to do with skinny       no  siree  it has not   i told him      all right  has it anything to do with the key      he shot it out just like that and oh  boy  wasn t i up in the air     i said   maybe  kind of  yes  it has       well then  you d better tell me all about it   he said      i can t   i told him     he said   oh  yes  you can       i promised i wouldn t   i said      well then   he said   we re all up in the air and i guess i can t help  you much  i just thought that maybe two heads would be better than one   that s all  the money came out of the locker  that s sure  any idea who  it belongs to      for a minute i just sat there thinking  watching him dip his oars  he  lifted them up and i could hear the water drip from them  and then it  would be all quiet till he did it again      i couldn t row ashore with one oar   he said   i d just have to scull   two oars are better than one  same with heads  blakeley  skinny s got  till wednesday  you ve done a good job so far  i dare say the cross  will be here by wednesday  ever try to row feather stroke  blakeley      gee  i just couldn t help what i did  i just couldn t resist that  fellow  i said   bert  you ve got more brains than i have  that s one  sure thing  and i can t help doing just what you say  i have to admit  you re a wonder  i can t do any more alone  i can t  we have to be  partners  kind of  do you believe that about the elks throwing him  down  bert  there was a fellow  a big fellow  and he s a son of the man  that owns this boat  and he s a lieutenant   this is just what i told  him  i said   he s had a whole lot of dandy adventures and he took his  uniform off to go fishing and hid it in the house boat  and then when  he came to get it  the boat was gone  because his father told our troop  that we could use it  and after we got way down as far as staten island  he sneaked on board one night and put his old clothes in the locker and  took his uniform  and afterwards he dropped the key when he tried to  give me some money and skinny found it  he found the money  too  and he  gave it to mr  ellsworth  but he forgot about the key       he gave it to mr  ellsworth  huh   bert said      yes  he did   i told him   and that s why i m going to stick to him  through thick and thin  i am  i don t care what  so now i told and i  have to be to blame       i ll be to blame   bert said      but anyway  it s on account of skinny   i said   and a fellow doesn t  know what to do all alone and i like you  gee  i like you a lot   i  said it right out to him  just like that  he looked at me steady  but  didn t say a word  and then i could feel my eyes all glistening and  everything looked funny and all of a sudden i didn t know what i was  saying at all   you have to help me   i said   because you re a regular  scout  i can see that  and you bet i d like to be just like you if i  only could  i would  you can bet  that fellow had lots of adventures  and he called me  skeezeks  and kind of laughed at me and kidded me  along  but  anyway  maybe he s all right  hey  i guess it s his money   but anyway  you ve got to help me  you have      that s one sure thing  because skinny s more important  maybe he ll  think that a little fellow like skinny isn t important  and that s the  trouble  hey  because he kind of punched me in the chest and laughed  and said i was a good little sport  he said fellows by the name of roy  are all right      all the while bert winton just sat there holding his oars out of the  water and watching me steady  like a fellow watching a bird that he s  been stalking     then he just said   well  i guess the big fellow was right          chapter xxv    tells about the letter we wrote    anyway  i don t care  maybe you ll think i was wrong  but i don t care   i just had to tell that fellow  there was something about that  fellow  i just can t tell you what it was     so then we fixed everything all up while we were rowing around  what  did i care about going tracking or stalking with my patrol  i should  worry  they could get along one day without me  all right we decided  we d write two letters to lieutenant donnelle and send one to his house  and the other to camp dix in wrightstown  we decided we d write them  that very day and hike into catskill to mail them  so he d be sure to  get one wherever he was  in time for us to get an answer before next  wednesday     mr  ellsworth went to albany that day  because he had some business to  attend to  but i knew he wouldn t do anything more about skinny till he  got back and that was one good thing  this was the letter that we  decided to send because i kept the first copy we made  we wrote it as  if it came from me  but bert winton helped me     dear lieutenant donnelle       i hope you got back to camp all right and that uncle sam didn t get mad  about it  i hope you re there now  so you ll surely get this  anyway  i  hope you ll admit that two heads are better than one  because i had to  tell a fellow about you  that was because i guess he s the only one  here who would help me     there s a little fellow named skinny mccord here  and he came from  bridgeboro with us  his name isn t really skinny  but they call him  that because he s that way  and one thing  you d be sorry for him if  you saw him  he talks kind of crazy sometimes  but that s because he  lived in a tenement house and didn t have enough to eat  you know it s  bad when you don t have enough to eat     he swam out and saved a fellow s life and then there was a lot of money  missing out of the fellow s pocket  and the fellows here think skinny  stole it     the reason they think that is  because he found the key to your locker  and he went to the house boat  after that our scoutmaster went there  with the key and found about two hundred dollars in your locker  i  don t know whether it was in the old clothes you took off or not  but  anyway  the fellow who s a good friend of mine  says that maybe you ll  send a letter right away as quick as you can and say that that money  belongs to you  so will you please do that  i send you a stamped  envelope so you ll be sure to do it     maybe a big fellow that has had a lot of adventures like you  and  nearly lost his life a lot of times and did other dandy things   wouldn t think it was so much to save a fellow from drowning  but  anyway  there s a medal called the gold cross that we have  and only a  fellow can win it that has saved somebody s life  maybe it isn t as  much as the distinguished service cross or that french cross either   but anyway  its a big honor  that s sure  and we want skinny to get it   so will you please answer this letter right away  maybe you won t  remember  because you have so many adventures  but i m the fellow you  met on the house boat  so please answer so we will get it before next  wednesday  maybe you ve got a lot of important things to do  but if you  could just see skinny you d answer quick  because anyway  you were nice  to me and you said i was a bully little pal  maybe you won t remember  it  but you did  anyway  you bet i ll do something for you if i ever  get a chance     your friend     roy blakeley     p s  be sure to send the answer as soon as you can     we wrote the letter up on sunset rock near the camp and as soon as we  got it finished we started off to catskill  because it would go sooner  than if we mailed it in leeds  just as we were passing the pavilion  we  met connie bennett and hunt ward and vic norris     connie said   well  i suppose you know what your little birthday  present put over on us   he called skinny a birthday present  because  westy martin and i gave skinny to the elks when we first found him   i  suppose you think we were after that two hundred  too  well  you can  take your little birthday present back  it was a lemon  we got stung       if you got what you deserved   i said   you d get more than stung      he said   yes       yes   i said   y  e  s  yes  i never said you wanted the money  i know  every one of you is square  skinny too  did i ever say you were not  i  said you wanted the cross  that s what i said  and so you did  and i  tell you now that you re going to get it and skinny s going to bring it  to you  chuck him out if you want to  he should worry  if he isn t good  enough for you  he s good enough  do you see that cabin up on the hill   do you see this fellow that s with me  he belongs to the royal bengal  tigers  if anybody should ask you  and skinny s good enough for  him    he can sleep up there  he should worry  they ve got three extra cots      they d better keep their watches near them   vic norris said   take  him  you re welcome to him  nobody ever said we were crooks in our  patrol       nobody said you were   i shouted  and bert winton just had to hold me  back   but you wouldn t talk like that if mr  ellsworth was here  and  you know you wouldn t  do you suppose i d let anybody say you weren t  on the square  we re all in the one troop  but you boosted skinny  you  used him  and in a crazy fit he went out and blamed near gave his life  for you  he doesn t know two of the laws  he can t say the oath  straight  because you had his head filled with awards and medals and  things  you wanted the gold cross and now  by christopher  i m going to  see that you get it  you ll have nothing to say about it  skinny mccord  is going to bring you the gold cross just as you wanted  and you re  going to shout and cheer till you can t speak       who ll make us   connie said       i will    i told him         chapter xxvi    tells about geography and all that kind of stuff    first we tried to find skinny to take him with us  but he wasn t  anywhere around  somebody told us they thought he was off somewhere  with uncle jeb  i guess maybe uncle jeb didn t know anything about all  the talk  because that was often the way it was with him  and even if  he did know  maybe he took skinny anyway  one thing sure  i hoped it  was true  because whenever a fellow goes off with uncle jeb  he tells  him all about the trees and things like that  trees can be friends to  you and they never go back on you  that s one thing     i said   he ll be all right as long as he s with uncle jeb      bert said   yes  but we ll have to get back before camp fire  he ll be  wandering around alone  i ll take him up to our cabin  guess he ll be  all right till we get back  temple camp can be a mighty lonely place  sometimes  blakeley      just the same  all the way over to the hudson i kept thinking about  skinny and hoping he wasn t hiding away from the fellows or off all  alone somewhere  i knew they wouldn t bother with him  especially now   and i kept thinking that maybe he d go away by himself and get into  some harm  i kept thinking about how he said   i want to be alone by  myself   and he d feel that way even more now  on account of the  disgrace     i said   poor little skinny  i wish we had him along       he s with uncle jeb most likely   bert said   wonder what the old man  thinks about it  ever look into those gray eyes of his       you never catch uncle jeb saying anything till he s sure   i said    and even then  it takes him a couple of minutes to get his pipe out of  his mouth  he says when you aim always aim as if you had only one  bullet and it was the last one in the world       that s him all right   bert said      well  there s no good worrying   i told him   we ll just get back as  soon as we can       what do you say we row across and cut through nick s valley   bert  asked   it s shorter       i m game   i said   the quicker the sooner       we can follow the old creek bed   he said   know where that is  don t  you      i said   believe me  the only bed i know anything about is the one i  sleep in  i don t see how you find out so many things  especially as  you were never here before       oh  i like to just prowl around   he said   that s the way with  tigers       i notice you always have a stick  too   i said     he said   sure a stick s good company  i just root around with it       this is my third season here   i said   and i never even heard about  any old creek bed  i never heard about nick s valley either       guess you never talked much with the old farmers  hey   he asked     we rowed across the lake to nick s cove  i knew all about that  because  it was where the campers were and besides i knew about it anyway   if  you will look on the map you ll see it and you ll notice how there are  mountains there  kind of two sets of mountains with a space between  i  made that map so you could see just how everything happened  because   believe me  we were going to have  some  adventure  only we didn t know  it     we rowed way up into the end of nick s cove and pulled the skiff part  way up on shore  one thing i noticed and that was that some of the  trees around there stood in the water  i knew that was on account of  the lake being swollen  because there had been so much rain lately   even over at temple camp the water was up to the spring board  so that  when we jumped on it  it splashed right into the lake      cove is pretty big after all the rain   bert said  and then  sure  enough  he looked around and broke a branch off a tree and pulled the  twigs off it   that ll do to poke around with   he said   now come  ahead       you and your stick are like uncle jeb and his pipe   i told him     he said   now we ll wend our way through old nick s valley  it ll bring  us right out near the old creek bed  then we can follow that right down  to the river  that s the way skinny did  but i guess he just stumbled  through that way  ever hear of old nick       only on account of the name  nick s cove   i said   is he dead       oh  very much dead   he said   he died about a hundred years ago   didn t you know he was dead       believe  me   i never even knew he was sick   i told him     then he said   well  from all i can learn  old nick owned all the land  for miles around here  and he lived at the bottom of black lake       good night   i said   if i owned as much land as that  i wouldn t live  at the bottom of a lake       kind of damp  huh   he asked   but you see black lake wasn t here  then       where was it   i asked him      well it just wasn t   he said   it was dry land  the way i make it  out  it was bowl valley  and old nick lived right down in the bottom of  bowl valley  there s an old woman on the berry creek road who smokes a  clay pipe  she s about a hundred years old  she told me all about it   people around here can t even tell you where bowl valley was  they  don t know what you re talking about when you mention such a place  i  dug up a whole lot of stuff about it  old nick s got descendants living  around here now  and they don t even know about it       but you found out   i said      that s because i m an old tramp   he said  laughing sort of   i like  to sit up on barnyard fences and chin with old wives  whenever i can  manage to get away from my patrol       gee  i don t blame them for not letting you get away from them   i  said     all the while we were hiking it along between the mountains and it was  pretty wet in some places  because it was a low valley we were in      now this is nick s valley   bert said   it s all full of puddles  hey   look out for your feet  this will bring us out at the old creek bed and  we can follow that down to the hudson  look at that fish  will you  a  killie  huh  washed away in here  some rains   he poked a little killie  out from under some grass with his stick  honest  that fellow never  missed anything   sometimes i root out the funniest kinds of insects  you ever saw with a stick   he said   it s a kind of a magic wand  ever  talk with a civil engineer       believe me   i said   the only civil engineer i ever talked with  did  most of the talking  he wouldn t let us play ball in his lot  he was an  uncivil engineer  that s what  he  was      bert said   well  there was a civil engineer here with a troop from out  west somewhere  he was a scoutmaster  he took me on a couple of good  hikes  we found some turtle shells over through there  a little farther  along  and when he took a squint at the land he saw how a little  valley  all grown up with weeds and brush  ran along east and west  he  said that was where the creek once flowed and it didn t come within a  mile of the lake  savvy  the place where the lake is now used to be  bowl valley  when the creek changed its bed and cut through a couple of  miles south  it just filled up bowl valley and there you are  black  lake  presto chango  funny how old dame nature changes her mind now and  then       that s just the way it is with girls   i said     bert said   well  and that scoutmaster said she d be changing her mind  again some day  too  he said the topography around here is pretty  shaky  whatever that means       oh  boy   i said   break it to me gently  do you mean that some fine  day we ll wake up and find black lake has sneaked off       that s just about it   he said      do you call that fair and square   i asked   after mr  temple bought  the lake and gave it to temple camp  believe me  it  ought  to be  called black lake  it isn t very white  that s one sure thing       that may not happen for a thousand years   bert said         chapter xxvii    tells about how we tried to stop it raining    jumping jiminy  that was a new one on  me   lakes moving around like  people that live in flats   good night   and where would temple camp  be  i d like to know  and just after we paid four dollars and eighteen  cents to put up a springboard      if you wouldn t mind   i said   i d like to know how that could  happen  because if it s going away i m going to stalk it       do you know what erosion is   he said      not guilty   i told him      well   he said   it s earth being eaten away  kind of       by who   i asked   he must have some appetite       by the water   he said   that s what causes changes in topography       all right   i said   i ll take your word for it  but will the lake be  there when we get back  because i ve got some eel lines out      he said   oh  yes  it won t move till may first    thank goodness for  that   i told him     i guess maybe you d better look at the map now  hey  it isn t much of a  map  but you should worry  if you don t take a good look at it  pretty  soon you won t know where you re at  i guess you can squint out the  valley between the mountains  that s nick s valley  everything around  there belonged to old nick  if he didn t own the moon  it was because  he couldn t reach it     now  that s just where we went through  see  and it was all full of  puddles  young lakes  i couldn t draw them with a pencil  but they were  there  i can prove it  because i got my feet wet  pretty soon bert  said   here s where you ought to have your scout staff with you   and  just then i stumbled down among a lot of brush      now you re in it   he said      in what   i asked him      in the bed   he said      you call this a bed   i asked him   i like a brass bed better       if you d only had your staff  you could have felt ahead       i can feel a head now   i told him   and it s got a good bump on it       well   he said   you re right in the hollow where the old creek used  to flow  let s push along through it a little ways and see what we can  dig up      you couldn t see that it was a hollow just looking at it  but you had  to go down into it and then you knew  it was all grown up with bushes  and we just went along through it  the same as if we were pushing  through a jungle  all of a sudden i felt something crunch under my  foot  and when i picked it up  i saw it was a fish s backbone      see   bert said   what did i tell you      it seemed funny to be squirming our way along where a creek used to  flow before it changed its mind and decided to flow into bowl valley    maybe it changed its mind and made the lake because it knew the scouts  were coming  hey   i asked   that was a good turn       it was a good  long  turn   he said   and nobody around here seems to  know anything about this old creek bottom  we just stumbled into it the  same as you did  that s some bump you ve got       sure  my topography is changed   i told him     he said   old nick fought in the revolutionary war  he owned all this  land around here right through to the lake  i mean bowl valley  his  house was at the bottom of bowl valley       what do you say we fish it up some day   i asked him      all this was his farm   bert said   see that old silo there  i guess  that s what it was  or something like it       maybe he hid muskets or powder from the redcoats there  hey   i said     now if you ll look at the map  you ll see just where we were  i was  right on the edge of that ring i made  do you see the ring  well  that  ring was really a round hole in the ground just beside the old creek  bottom  gee  i wish you could have seen that hole  because you can t  make a hole on a map     it was about fifty feet deep and about thirty feet wide  i guess  and  it was all walled in with masonry  it looked like a great well  bert  thought it had something to do with the farm that used to be there   because quite near it  there was an old foundation  maybe it was some  kind of a silo  i don t know     i said   i d like to get down in that       what for   bert said   there s nothing but puddles at the bottom  how  would you ever get out       couldn t we drop one of those saplings into it and i could shin up  that   i said  because i saw two or three saplings lying around  i  suppose they blew down in the storms lately      what would be the use   he asked   you can see what s down there  if  we re going to get those letters onto a mail train  we ve got to  hustle      that was enough for me  because i cared more about skinny than i did  about all the old creek bottoms and holes in the ground this side of  jericho  so i just said   righto   and we started following the old  creek bed  till pretty soon the bushes were so thick that we hit up  north of it a little ways and hiked straight over to the houseboat     when we got to the house boat we lowered the skiff and rowed across to  catskill and mailed the letters  then we went up the street for a  couple of sodas  bert bought some peanut brittle  too  i m crazy about  that  then we went to another store and got some post cards  some of  them had pictures of temple camp on them  i sent home about six  all  the while it was getting dark and pretty soon it began to rain  so i  said   let s go and get a couple more sodas till it holds up   we drank  two sodas each  but even still it didn t hold up      we can t make it hold up that way   bert said   i don t believe twenty  sodas would do it  the way it s raining now       i guess you re right   i said   but  anyway  i m willing to try  twenty  if you say so      no fellow could ever say  i  was a quitter         chapter xxviii    tells about how dame nature changed her mind    maybe you ll laugh at that stopping a shower with sodas  but once on my  way home from school i stopped in vander s drug store to get a soda   and wait for the rain to stop  when i was finished it hadn t stopped   so i got another soda  a strawberry  even after that the rain didn t  stop and i was just going to start out anyway  when a man who was in  there said   why don t you try one more   so i did  a pineapple  and by  the time i had finished that  the rain had stopped  so that proves it     but that day i m telling you about  i guess it wouldn t have stopped  even if we had stayed in catskill a couple of hours drinking sodas  we  sat on one of the benches in the waiting room of the wharf where the  albany boats stop  and watched it rain  it was so thick that we could  hardly see across the river  merry christmas  didn t it come down  we  saw the big day boat go up and all her lights were burning  it was so  dark on the river  i guess we waited a couple of hours      it s all on account of the old what s his name  st  swithin   i said    i bet he was the head of an umbrella trust      bert said   oh  i don t know  i kind of like rain  it s all part of the  scout game   that was just like him  he had some use for everything     i guess it must have been about supper time when it held up enough for  us to start across  anyway  i know i was hungry  but that was no proof  it was supper time  sometimes i ve been hungry in the middle of the  night  i guess st  swithin stopped to have his supper  anyway  it began  pouring again as soon as we got across      anyway  we got the letters mailed   i said   what do i care  let it  rain       i m willing   bert said   as long as we can t stop it   we were both  feeling good  even if we were wet      suppose lieutenant donnelle writes and says he doesn t know anything  about the money   i said  because now the excitement of getting the  letters ready and all that was over  i began to feel a little shaky     bert said   well  if it s a case of  supposing   suppose we start  home      we hiked it back the same way we had come  all the way in a pelting  rain  it came down in sheets  and pillowcases  when we hit into the old  creek bed  the water was running through it just the same as if it was  a regular creek  it was right up to the top of the bushes that grew  there and dragging them sideways  as it rushed along      well  what do you know about that   i said     bert just stood looking at it and then he said   that s no rain water       sure it is   i said   what else do you suppose it is    something s  wrong   he said     all of a sudden he reached in through the wet bushes and pulled  something out   look at that   he said     it was a sort of a little college pennant on a stick      those fellows went to catskill didn t they   bert asked me  kind of  quick     i told him   yes  i thought so       lucky for them   he said   that s off their tent  come on  hurry up      we didn t try to go through the old creek bottom  but even alongside it  we began coming to big puddles  and pretty soon we were wading through  water up to our waists  even a hundred feet away from it  the land was  like a lake and we just plodded and stumbled through water  i knew now  that the rain itself could never have done that  pretty soon we must  have got over into the old creek bed  because we stumbled and went  kerflop in  and the next thing we knew  we were swimming      let s get out of this  but try to keep near it   bert said   so we ll  know where we re going  this has got me rattled  i don t know what s  happened or where we re at  i don t even know if we re north or south  of the creek bed      it was pretty hard keeping near the hollow  because all the land was  flooded and we had to feel each step  but if we got away from it   good  night   we didn t know where we might end  only the trouble was  it  kept getting worse and worse the farther we went  and it nearly toppled  us over backwards  it was flowing so strong     pretty soon bert stopped and said   listen      we were both standing in the water up to our waists  and i was  shivering  it was so cold      do you hear the sound of water rushing   he asked me     i listened and heard a sound far off like a water fall      what is it   i asked      search  me    bert answered   but we re in bad here  let s head for  the mountains      now i didn t know what had happened  except that the whole country was  under water  when it comes to the lay of the land i can usually tell  where i m at  but when it comes to the lay of the water   good night    and believe me  there s nothing that changes the looks of things like  water      i think those are the mountains that make nick s valley   i said    let s try to get over that way       there s a waterfall coming down out of a crevice between them   bert  said   i know what s happened  the valley is flooded      you see we were in the low fields west of those mountains  i can t tell  you just where  but somewhere  there were hollows in the fields so  sometimes we were walking and sometimes we were swimming  it was the  outside of the mountains that we saw  as you might say  i mean the side  away from the valley  so the water coming out through a cleft proved  that the water must be pretty high inside  i mean in nick s valley  i  guess you ll see what i mean if you ll look at the map     but  believe me  it wasn t easy to get to those mountains  seeing them  was one thing and getting to them was another  we just plodded around   stumbling off little hills that were under water and we didn t seem to  get anywhere  after a while we came out on higher land where there  wasn t much water except puddles      some cruise  hey   i said      shh  listen   bert said   you can hear it plainer now  look over  there      now as near as i can tell you we must have been standing near the north  side of the old creek bottom and we must have been pretty close to the  old silo  or whatever you call it  but we didn t know that then   believe  me   we didn t know anything  except that we were wet  we were  standing on a little sort of a hill and the water was washing up almost  to our feet  besides it was getting dark     but anyway  this is what we saw  and if you just make believe that  you re standing on a little hill near that old pit and looking south  toward black lake  you ll see just what we saw  as you might say  we  saw the water just pouring through nick s valley and coming toward us  and going pell mell into the old creek bed  now that s the best way i  can tell it to you  i guess the little hill we were on acted kind of  like a back stop maybe  anyway  that s what bert said  because the  water only beat against it and then went tumbling back into the creek  bed and down toward the hudson  it was down that way that it overflowed  mostly and flooded the fields we had been plodding through      one thing  we had a grandstand view   i said     and believe me  that was true  the water just came pouring and rushing  between those mountains  and sometimes we could see trees  and things  we thought might be parts of houses coming along  one big white thing  we saw  and we knew it was a tent  black lake was coming out to meet us  through nick s valley         chapter xxix    tells about how we looked into the pit    i never saw anything like that before and it  it didn t exactly scare  me  but it made me feel sort of funny  it gave me the creeps to see  right in front of me like that  how lakes and valleys and all the land  could be changed and me standing there watching it  it seemed as if the  earth was being made all over again  as you might say      that s where we came through only a little while ago   i said   how  will it be inside where the lake was  is      especially it seemed queer like  because it was getting dark fast and  the sound of the water rushing and the sky all black made everything  seem awful gloomy      is temple camp all right  do you suppose   i asked bert      guess so   he said   that s over on the south shore  but hanged if i  know how we re going to get there or anywhere else  guess we ll just  have to stand here like the statue of liberty      i said   listen to the water       it isn t so high in the valley   bert said   it must have been worse a  couple of hours ago   then all of a sudden he said      shh  listen       i hear it   i said      no  not the water   he said   listen  do you hear a sound like  groaning      i listened  and as sure as i was standing there  i heard a low sound   as if someone was groaning far away      that isn t the water  is it   bert asked     sure it isn t   i told him   and it isn t from up through nick s  valley  because  look  the wind is blowing from us that way      i held up my scout scarf to show him how it blew toward the valley  and  again we heard the groans  long and low  sort of      it s somewhere right around here   bert said  then all of a sudden he  said   look      just in back of us  not more than twenty or thirty feet off  was the  pit i could see it plain  because the stone work came up a couple of  feet or so above the ground  right close to it was a canoe all smashed  in  i could see now that a couple of hours or so earlier  the water  must have poured through there when it first overflowed the creek     we listened again and could hear the groaning plain      i don t know who it is   bert said   but that s the gold dust twins   canoe  come on      we plodded over through the mud and water to the pit and looked over  the edge  it was pretty dark down there  but i could see that there was  only a little water in the bottom of it  not much more than before      that s funny   bert said   it must have overflowed in there when it  first splashed down into the creek bed      he felt in his pocket and took out a flashlight and held it down the  hole  but it was wet and wouldn t light      look down at the bottom  over at the left side   he said   do you see  something      at first it looked like a bundle all covered with mud  then i saw  something white on it  it was a face  it didn t budge  just lay there   and it seemed awful white on account of the bottom being almost dark      it s skinny   bert said  in a kind of whisper     i just said   yes      i couldn t say anything more  because i was all trembling         chapter xxx    tells about how tigers leap    of course  we didn t stop to think about it then  but i knew that when  the water first came rushing through nick s valley  it must have been  dashed right into the pit  there was skinny s body to prove it   afterward  when it got flowing into the creek bottom and spreading out  over the fields below  i could see how it wouldn t flow into that hole   but you can see for yourself  if you look at the map  that in the first  rush it  must  have done that  gee  i m no civil engineer  but anyway   i could see that  anyway  we didn t stop to think about that  or the  canoe either  but only just skinny      see if the paddle s anywhere around   bert said  his voice was awful  funny  sharp kind of  as if he meant business      what do you want that for   i asked him  all excited      look and see  do as i tell you   he just said     it was in the smashed canoe and i just stood there holding it      what ll i do with it   i asked him      just hold it   he said  then he said   now  blakeley  there s only one  way to get down there and that s to jump  it s pretty deep  but the  main question is   is it wide enough   if it is  well  i m a tiger and  i ought to manage it      i didn t know then  but i found out afterward that when a tiger makes a  leap out of a tree he rolls over when he hits ground and turns a sort  of summersault  so as to break the shock  there s a certain way to do  it  that s all i know  but i knew when he said it  that the royal  bengal tigers from ohio were like the others away out in india  in more  ways than i ever thought about     i said   bert  you can t do it  tigers are        shut up   he said   and listen        even if you did   i said   no  i  won t  shut up   you  listen  even  if you did  how could you get out  have some sense  i ve followed you  all the time  but now you ve got to listen  i like you better than any  fellow  even westy  and   please  wait a minute  even skinny  it s too  late  bert      he said   blakeley  we have two chances  just two  you know the third  law  i don t tell you what you ve got to do  blakeley  that s your  business  but listen   he put his hand on my shoulder and his voice  was all husky  he said   blakeley  if i don t make it  you ll have my  body to ease the shock for you  people  people will be here to morrow    you ll get out  it s getting  in  we have to think about  if i don t  make it  try to land on your feet  a little forward  like this  see   and duck your head and do a summersault forward  see  if you don t want  to  it s none of my business  only i m telling you how  here   he said   and he threw a lot of things out of his pockets   you give them to my  patrol       keep them   i said   i ll get them when i come down  if that s  necessary  it s  it s you and i and skinny  bert  sink or swim  live  or die  it s the three of us  i m ready          chapter xxxi    tells about the old passageway    honest  as sure as i m sitting here  i would have gone down first    after the way that fellow spoke to me  it just sent thrills through me   and only a couple of days before  i didn t like him and i thought he  didn t trust skinny     i grabbed hold of him and i said   bert  i  just a second   please   i  have to tell you  if i don t see you again  i mean so i can speak to  you  i have to tell you  you re a hero       but he jerked my hand off his sleeve  he didn t say anything  but just  jerked my hand off his sleeve  and i stood there holding the paddle   and i could hear the water rushing in the valley  and i was breathing  hard and all trembling     i called   bert  are you all right  bert   but he didn t answer  then i  went to the edge and i was all shaking from head to foot  but i was  ready  it was all dark down there and i couldn t see  anyway  i was  ready      bert   i called  and i just waited  i could hear the water rushing  through the valley and sometimes sounds like trees breaking  and i  heard a tree toad moaning  it seemed funny to hear that      bert   i called  i felt cold  and my wrists were all tingling   bert      then i stuck the paddle in the mud and hung my hat on the end of it   just then i heard a voice  it sounded strained and not like bert s  as  if it couldn t speak on account of pain      don t  jump  stay       i waited a few seconds and then called   if  you re  hurt  i m coming  anyway       don t  jump   he kind of groaned   i m all right  just a strain  don t  jump      i sat on the edge waiting  i was just counting the seconds  i was  afraid he d never speak again     then he said   all right  kiddo  just strained my wrist       are you  sure    i called down   dip it in the water  slap some mud on  it  is he dead      i knew now that he must be all right  because i heard him move  for  about half a minute he didn t answer  then he called up      he s alive  but he isn t conscious       how about  you    i said      alive and conscious   he said   don t worry      then for about a minute he didn t speak      do you want the paddle   i called      nope  chuck it   he said   this is a place of mystery  know where the  water went  there s a passageway down here  it s big enough to crawl  through  ouch       tell me the truth   i said   you re hurt       i m in a very critical condition from a swollen wrist   he said   shut  up  will you  there s a secret passageway or something or other down  here  where do you suppose it goes       hanged if  i  know   i said   what about skinny       he s breathing  that s all  i  know   he said     for a couple of minutes i sat on the edge thinking and i could hear him  down there  i didn t know what he was doing     then i called   you know rebel s cave  don t you  above the shore south  of nick s cove  near the outlet  maybe it comes out there  the passage   i mean       what makes you think so   he called      i don t say i think so   i said   only there s a kind of a passageway  that goes into the hills there  it starts in the cave  none of us ever  followed it  because it s so dark and wet  a fellow found an old musket  stock there once       what do you say   he called   there s no time to lose  that s sure   shall i try it  it would take an hour to flood this pesky old hole   even if i could stop up the passage      then all of a sudden i knew why he had told me to be ready with the  paddle  it was so i could open a little trench through the muddy land  and start the water flowing into the pit  that way he d get to the top  with skinny      but you can t stop up the passageway   i said   the water flowed  through it and went out somewhere  maybe through the cave and back  into the lake  if it s big enough you could do the same  both of us        stay where you are   he shouted   and don t be a fool  do you suppose  i want to carry two fellows through there  one s enough  by heck  i m  going to try it  it s the only thing to do       suppose it shouldn t bring you out anywhere   i said      suppose it should   he fired back at me     then he said   now  blakeley  i ll tell you what to do  i m going to  start through this place with the kid  he s alive  that s the most i  can tell you  it must come out somewhere and i ll bank on its coming  out where you say  if it doesn t and        don t talk like that  bert   i said   it s  got  to  if  you  want it  to  what is it you want me to do      he said   i want you to beat it up through the mountains that close in  nick s valley  that way you ll get to the lake  don t expect to see  nick s cove  because it s off the map  when you get to the lake  find  somebody  get over to camp if you can  i don t care how  maybe the boat  we left in the cove is cast up there  you can t tell  anyway  keep your  head and don t get excited  the lake is there  it ll be lower than it  was  but all the water below the valley level will be there  get some  people and take them to rebels  cave or whatever you call it and just  wait       is that all i shall do   i asked him      what else can you do  just wait there  or two or three of you might  come in with lanterns to meet me       suppose you re not there   i said  all trembling      well  if i m not there  you ll know i m with skinny anyway  and if  anybody ever digs up our bones  they won t know who s who  hurry up  now  beat it  and remember you re a scout      but suppose        you leave that to me   he said         chapter xxxii    tells about what i discovered in rebels  cave     all righto  so long   i heard him say     after a few seconds i called   are you all right      and i heard him say  as if his voice was muffled and far away   all  right  so far      i said to myself   poor little kid  he isn t very heavy  that s one  thing   then i started off     it wasn t hard to swim across the old creek bed  because the water was  flowing easier now  and pretty soon i was hiking it up through the  mountains  now  the way i went was through those mountains west of  nick s valley  and i went south toward the lake  you look at the map  and you ll see just the way i went     the woods are pretty thick up in those mountains and a couple of times  i got rattled about which way to go  but most of the time i could look  down and see the valley and the water in the bottom of it  just like a  river  it wasn t rushing any more and i guessed that whatever happened   the worst of it was over     pretty soon i came out where i could look down and see the lake all  spread out before me  it was there all right but first i didn t get the  hang of things  because nick s cove wasn t there at all  there was just  a kind of a river flowing from where nick s cove used to be  right  through the valley  there were lots of trees  all uprooted  down there   too  and the place was so different that i couldn t even tell where the  gold dust twins  tent had been  anyhow  it wasn t there any more  that  was sure  all around the lake was a kind of gray border and i guess it  showed how much the water had gone down  but  gee  there was enough  lake left to satisfy anybody  a scout that wouldn t be satisfied with  what was left must be a hog  but  oh  boy  when that flood started  it  must have piled up in nick s valley  anyway  i could see temple camp  all safe across the water  but the spring board was way up in the air    gee  it looked awful funny     there were half a dozen or so of the temple camp boats with fellows in  them  flopping around near the old cove  it was almost dark  but i  could see them plain  i guess they had rowed across just to look around  and see how things looked there  a couple of hours before they would  have been carried right through on the flood  but when i looked down it  was pretty calm there     i shouted to them and started down the mountainside for the shore  i  could see westy and pee wee and a couple of portland scouts in one of  the boats  all the while i was coming down i kept shouting and when i  got to the shore  there were half a dozen boats to meet me  mr  elting  and uncle jeb were in one of them  besides  i could see half a dozen  fellows plodding around on shore  i knew they were looking for gold  dust camp      don t bother hunting for those fellows   i shouted  all out of breath    they re all right  they re down at catskill or somewhere  bert winton  started through the passageway from an old pit  he s got skinny  take  me in and row down to rebels  cave  anybody got a lantern      i guess they thought i was crazy  appearing from up in the mountains  like that and shouting about pits and passageways and rebels  cave  but  as soon as mr  elting and uncle jeb took me into their boat  i told  them about all that happened     uncle jeb just looked at mr  elting and mr  elting looked awful  serious  then uncle jeb shook his head and said   it daon t come out  through rebels  cave  i reckon  i ain t never  explored  rebel s cave   but it daon t come out thar  nohow      i was just trembling all over when i heard him say that      it was the only way he could do  anyway   i said   it must come out  somewhere      mr  elting said   we re not blaming you  my boy  nor winton  either    then he said  kind of serious   let me go ashore  uncle jeb  some of  you row over to the cave  here  some of you boys  come along with me   who wants to volunteer to go back through the mountains  george   he  said  he s in a boston troop  that fellow george    you row across and  get some lanterns  quick  you go with him  harry  get your fists on  those oars  hurry up  bring some rope and an aid kit  you stay with  uncle jeb  roy      gee  i can hardly tell you how things happened  the next second fellows  were hurrying back and forth  getting in and out of boats  while the  one boat skimmed across to the camp landing     in a half a minute mr  elting and about a dozen scouts were standing on  the cove shore  waiting for the boat to come back  and meanwhile we  rowed down along the south shore to where the cave is  it s about half  way down to the outlet  you can see about where it is  several other  boats went down there with us  westy was in one of them and i made him  come in our boat  because now that bert was gone  maybe dead  and  skinny  too  i just felt as if i d like to have one of my patrol near  me  i just felt that way  besides  westy was my special chum and after  all i liked him best of any  when you re feeling kind of shaky  that s  the time you like to have one of your own patrol with you  you bet     soon we heard the boat coming back and could see the lanterns bobbing    pull hard   i heard mr  elting call from the shore  it sounded awful  clear in the night  the fellows in the boat rowed straight for us and  gave us an aid kit and a couple of lanterns      that you  blakeley   i heard a fellow say  it was young mr  winter   he s mr  temple s secretary  and he always spends his vacations at  temple camp   who s there   he asked      uncle jeb and westy and i   i said   i don t know who s in the other  boats  everybody  i guess      they didn t stop but a second and they pulled for where mr  elting and  the fellows were waiting  i could hear their voices and see the  lanterns rocking  as they hiked up the side of the mountains      maybe i ought to have gone with them   i said      they ll find the place  i reckon   uncle jeb said   naow let s pull  ashore and root around      the fellows in the other boats waited  just rowing around close to  shore  while uncle jeb and westy and i climbed up to the cave  it was  higher above the lake than it was before  on account of the water  escaping and we had to scramble up through a lot of mud     i was so excited i couldn t keep still and i just stumbled into the  cave and stood there for a couple of seconds  holding the lantern  it  was as dark as pitch and smelled like earth  i kind of had a feeling  that it was a grave  i was sorry i had ever shouted down to bert winton  that maybe the passageway came out there  anyway  i held the lantern  into the passage way  it was a sort of an opening between two big rocks  inside  then i squeezed myself in and went ahead about thirty or forty  feet  i guess  and that was every bit as far as i could go  the  passageway just fizzled out against a great big rock  it didn t lead  anywhere at all     then  all of a sudden  a cold feeling came over me and my fingers just  loosened and i dropped the lantern  it sort of scared me when i heard  the glass crash on the ground  for about half a minute i couldn t  budge  i just couldn t go out and tell westy and uncle jeb that it was  all up with bert winton  i just couldn t do it  because i knew i was to  blame for shouting that down to him like a fool     if i had been a good scout i would have  known  that passage didn t  lead anywhere  look how bert was always finding things out and how he  knew all about the country around there  i could just kind of see him  poking around with his stick  and i just couldn t call and i felt sick   as if i was going to fall right down      it was me that killed him   i cried  and i heard a voice say    killed  him       it was just an echo  i guess         chapter xxxiii    tells about how westy and i waited    uncle jeb and westy came in and saw how it was and there wasn t  anything more to do  so we went back to the boat  the fellows who were  waiting around in the other boats said it wasn t my fault  but anyway   i knew it was     uncle jeb said   wall  naow  you take it kinder hard  roay  remember  thars two strings ter this here bow  as the feller says  we got another  party uv good scouts ter hear frum yet  you jest come over ter camp  n  get a cup uv hot coffee      i said i didn t want any hot coffee and that i was just going to wait  around with westy  i just wanted to be with westy  so uncle jeb went  back in one of the other boats and westy and i just rowed around  together  at the spot where the others had started up the mountain  a  couple of boats were pulled up so that the fellows could cross when  they got back  it was pitch dark up the mountainside and i looked up to  see if i could see any lights that might be their lanterns      they can t get back for an hour yet   westy said   don t let s get too  close to the new outlet  it may be running pretty strong  even yet      i said   i don t care a lot what happens to me now       well   i  do   westy said      i know i haven t seen much of you in the last couple of days   i told  him   but i don t want you to think it s because i don t care any more   it was mostly because i was trying to help skinny  anyway  it s all  over now  how did the fellows treat him to day  if they d known it was  his last day  they d have treated him decent  i bet       i didn t see him   westy said   i was hunting for you most all the  afternoon       i m going to stick by you closer after this   i said   it was only  because bert winton was  sort of  you know        i know   westy said   everybody fell for him  i m not blaming you       but anyway  i m glad i ve got you now   i told him   we were always  good friends  that s one sure thing  i d feel mighty lonesome if i  didn t have you       i never got jealous   westy said   i always knew how it was with us  i  just went stalking with the ravens  it was so kind of slow       it won t be that way any more   i told him  and i just almost had to  gulp  gee  i don t know why   only a couple of nights ago i was  flopping around like this with bert winton and now he s gone  he was a  hero  that s sure  and you and i are together again       we heard you while we were at camp fire   westy said      did you mind   i asked      no  i didn t mind   he said      it s funny how two fellows get to be chums   i said     westy didn t say anything  only just rowed around  after a while he  said   he knew how to feather  that fellow did  i guess his troop will  go home now  hey       maybe he turned and went back through the passage and they ll find him  all safe in the pit   westy said      nope   i told him   the lake s different  everything is changed   skinny won the cross and he s dead  and bert is dead  it doesn t make  any difference what the camp thinks about skinny now  because he won t  know it  and even if they re sore still  bert won t know it  they won t  be back  everything is changed       you just said you and i are not changed   westy said     then we just rowed around and neither one of us said anything  it was  awful dark and still      how do you suppose skinny happened to get there   i asked westy      the flood carried him through   he said      but how did he happen to be in the cove  it couldn t have carried him  through if he hadn t been in the cove   i said      guess we ll never know that   i told him     then we rowed around some more and neither of us said anything      look up there and see if you think that s a lantern   westy said   after a while      yes  it is   i said   they re coming back   and then my heart began to  thump      i bet they ve got them and that everything s all right   westy said    i kind of think so by the way the lantern is swinging      pretty soon we saw another light and then another one  and then i could  hear some of the fellows talking and hear twigs crunch under their feet  as they scrambled down  i didn t dare to call them  but westy called      any news  are they all right       who s there   a fellow called      two fellows from bridgeboro troop   westy shouted   have you got them   any news      just then a fellow came scrambling down and stood on the shore   the  whole blamed pit has fallen in   he said   it s just a pile of rocks  and mud  it s filled up to within six or eight feet of the surface   just collapsed  must have been some flood over that way          chapter xxxiv    tells about the strange figure    i didn t want to see them and i didn t want to hear anything more  i  just said   i knew it   to westy  but all the while i knew i had been  hoping all to myself  and now i couldn t even do that      i don t want to talk to them   i said   let s row along the north  shore and go home the long way  i don t want to go back yet  i just  want to stay on the lake with  you       westy said   just as you say       row along the north shore   i said   i d rather be here in the dark       just as you say   he said  awful nice and friendly like                                                 we could hear them rowing across and talking  the lanterns looked like  two little stars  one fellow said it would take a week to clear out the  pit  i heard mr  elting say   it must have happened as soon as he  crawled into that passage  because the passage surely didn t go far       now are you satisfied   i said to westy   you see how i m to blame  i  though it could be a mile long       winton thought so too   westy said      i wouldn t listen to anything against him  not now   i said  anyway  i  knew he couldn t be saved  i just did  then i said   westy  bert and i  were going to square skinny  we were going to prove he didn t take the  money  and we were going to see he got the cross  i never heard you say  what you thought  all i know is what everyone in camp thinks  but  listen  if a fellow is willing to give up his life  as bert did  trying  to prove a fellow innocent  if he s just willing to give up doing  everything else  he sat on the top of his troop cabin  he did  and said  to me        don talk   westy said   just sit still and let me row you around  hear  that night hawk       then doesn t that prove that he s innocent   i asked him   any fellow  with any sense can see that  you needn t tell me what you think  but  the  the gold cross isn t dead  it isn t  and a fellow can  he can win  it after he s dead  and those elks        listen   westy said   there s somebody on shore       what do i care   i said     he said   i know  but maybe it s the gold dust twins  if they came home  through the open country  they d be sure to hit the lake at the wrong  spot  maybe they re looking for their camp  let s get closer in   anyway      i didn t care much what he did  if it hadn t been for the gold dust  twins there would never have been any trouble  i knew that      i don t care where you go   i said      a good turn is a good turn   westy said   maybe everything has  changed  but good turns haven t changed  their own tent is gone  their  canoe is smashed  you said so yourself  and they re on the opposite  side from temple camp  you know our signboard over there    welcome to  friend or stranger         come on in and get them   i said   i don t care  i don t care about  anything  why did he ever try to paddle across in all that rain  that  was the beginning of all the trouble  a couple of bungling tenderfeet       as we rowed in and skirted the shore  i could see a dark figure  following along at the edge      who are you  what are you doing there   westy asked      want to get across   the person said and his voice sounded kind of  husky      what for   westy asked him     i guess he didn t answer  anyway  i didn t hear him  because i wasn t  paying much attention  westy rowed in and the fellow stepped out on a  rock in the water and waited     i saw he had a stick in his hand         chapter xxxv    tells about a new camp     that you  kiddo   he called      bert   i said      give us a lift over  will you      i just said   what  is it you  bert  say yes  say it s you       well  then  it s me   he said   hold her steady  my leg is stiff  all  right  shall i push off      he stood there in the boat and he was lame and his left hand was  hanging in his scout scarf that was made into a sling  in the lantern  light i could see the yellow and black stripes  and he pushed against  the stone with the stick that he had in his free hand  and started the  boat off     all i could say was just  bert   and i held the lantern close to him as  he sat down  there was a long cut on his face and he didn t have any  hat or jacket on and his trousers were all torn and dirty      where  did  you  where is skinny   i asked him      ever see a tiger use a crutch before   he said   i m a punk tiger    what d ye say       royal  royal bengal   westy said      the kid is down near the hudson shore   bert said  in that easy way he  had   he s at camp mccord  he s come up in the world since you saw  him       bert   i said   tell me  tell us  quick       not much to tell   he said   except skinny and i are both on the job   we re in the hands of the gold dust twins       the which   i blurted out      that s them   he said   and if you ever want to guy those fellows  you d better not do it when i m around  they re fourteen karat gold  dust  that s what  skinny walked around to their camp this morning  to  ask them not to believe that he took the money       poor little codger   westy said      oh  he isn t so poor   bert said   he s in soft with that pair  he  went around and asked them  please  not to believe it   please   do you  get that   please   he asked them not to take the money if anyone gave  it to them  because it  really wasn t theirs   that s him  they kept  him to lunch and told him they believed him and that nobody could cram  any money down their throats with a ramrod  hey  what do you think of  that       they may be green campers  but they re the whitest green campers i  ever heard of   i said      you said it   bert shouted   they told skinny to stay right there with  them and never mind about the fellows over at camp  they told him he  could have the tent and the flag and the canoe instead of the cross   and to just stay and make himself at home  when they started for the  races down below catskill  they left him sitting in the canoe  happy    with a capital h      after that you know what happened  skinny and the canoe and the whole  shebang went pell mell through the valley  lucky the twins weren t  there  when i got to catskill with skinny  who should we meet but the  twins and i told them everything that happened  how you and i rescued  skinny and all that      i said   how on earth did you get to catskill with him       well  what do you think those twins did  you have three guesses  they  bought a tent in catskill and a lot of canned stuff  one of them  telegraphed his father for more stuff  and money  i guess  and we re  camping out in a nice little grove right near the hudson  good fishing  and a row across whenever you want an ice cream soda  ought to appeal  to  you   hey  you notice i say we  that s us  camp mccord is the name  of the place and        but how about rescuing skinny   i asked him   how did you get him to  catskill  how about        shut up   he said   camp mccord is the name of the place and there  skinny s going to stay till the elk patrol of the bridgeboro troop  marches down in a body and hands him the gold cross  those are the gold  dust twins  orders       but bert   i said   that isn t the way they present the cross  you  have to have a special meeting and the scoutmaster        scoutmaster be hanged   he said   the elk patrol is going to march  down to camp mccord and hand the gold cross to skinny  we re just  waiting for a letter  scout bennett is going to do the handing  we  haven t made up our minds yet whether we ll have him kneel down or  not          chapter xxxvi    tells about what bert told me    he seemed different from the way he was before  he was all excited when  he talked  and i could see he was just crazy about those new plans     i said   but tell us how you rescued skinny       don t bother your head about trifles   he said   the passage came out  in the old creek bed in the high land east of the flood  i ll tell you  about it later  listen  do you know what those fellows were doing  they  may be rotten scouts  blakeley  but they re a   sports  they re having  a pennant made in catskill  they re going to fly it over the tent  it  says camp mccord       i don t see how you did all this so soon   i told him   i wish you d  tell me about the rescue       row quicker   he said   i ve got to see my patrol and get some duds  and beat it back by the road  they ll understand  it ll only be a few  days       bert   i said   i m going with you  westy and i are       he said   now don t begin that  we ve had one flood already  isn t that  enough  do you want everybody leaving camp  the trustees won t stand  for that  i can speak to my scoutmaster  but  you  can t because yours  is away  now don t spoil everything   please   come down and see us  to morrow  both of you  and we ll give you a couple of home made  doughnuts       will the twins make them       never you mind  come down to morrow and give us the once over  just  follow the shore up from pike s landing  you ll see a khaki colored  tent in among the trees  that s us  they re putting up the tent now       have you got drainage   westy asked him  kind of funny      they re digging a regular panama canal around that tent   he said      bert   i told him   you know the rule        now don t begin about rules  listen  your scoutmaster is away  about  every fellow in temple camp thinks skinny is just a miserable little  thief  he went over to see those fellows because  well you know why   they took him in  and  by jinks  he s going to stay there and so am i    till this thing is fixed up  blakeley and westy   he said  and i could  see he was pretty serious now   i went into that passageway with that  kid on my back  i was ready to crawl a mile and drag him along if i had  to  as it turned out  the passage was about a couple of hundred feet  long and came out in the old creek bed  like i said  up above the flood  area  blakeley  when i saw the light of day  or the light of night  rather  because anything was lighter than that black hole  and when i  laid that skinny little kid down  he doesn t weigh fifty pounds   blakeley  i just said to myself    by the great eternal  i m going to  stick to him like glue    that s what i said  even then i didn t know  he had been over to plead with those fellows and ask them  please  not  to believe he was a thief  when i heard that        illustration  i went into that passageway with that kid on my back       i know  bert   i told him   you re right      i m not thinking about myself   he said   my troop understands me  and  they understand skinny  he could bunk with us  or with you fellows  but  this is better       i hope nobody ll raise a kick   westy said     bert said   a kick  we re the ones to raise a kick  haven t i got  anything to say about it  i  couldn t  bring the kid here  i m not a  horse  so i did the next best thing  i carried him down the old creek  bed a ways  to where the water flowed into it  it was flowing easy  then  i laced a couple of broken off branches together and made the  craziest raft  you  ever saw  then i laid the kid on it and held his  head and poled with the other hand and that way we got down to the  hudson  i intended to get him to some house down there and then notify  camp  he was a little better by then and a fellow stayed with him near  the shore  while i rowed over to catskill for some iodine and stuff   would you believe it  i ran plunk into the gold dust twins in the drug  store  they were drinking sodas  they ve got you beaten seven ways at  that game  well  i told them all about the flood and how i found skinny  and how their camp was carried away  and they didn t seem to take it  hard at all  they just laughed and said it was part of the game      oh  blakeley   he said   then was when the fun started  telegrams  one  of them had to buy out a peanut stand for skinny  and then for a tent   we rooted out that old sail maker from bed  and made him sell us a  tent  they gave him an order for a flag   camp mccord   mind you   laugh  i just followed them around  they re two of the gamest sports  you ever saw  we went back to the landing in a taxi with cans of food  rolling all over the floor    go faster    one of them shouted to the  taxi man   or i ll fire a can of pickled beets at your head   we hired  a motor boat to take us over and then they retired from the game  some  whirligig  take it from me      illustration  map   this map shows you how the water broke through  frick s cove and flowed into the old creek bed        but they wouldn t pick out the place for a camp   bert said   they  made me do that   we don t want to be drowned out again   they said   honest  westy  those two fellows are down there now  digging a drain  ditch and carrying it way over to the hudson    safety first   that s  what they said  and skinny s sitting there with a bandage around his  head  eating peanuts      as soon as bert got out of the boat  he started right off up the hill  for tigers  den  as they called it  we could see him stumbling up the  path  limping to favor his leg      he ll go back by the road  i suppose   i said     westy and i just sat in the boat watching until we couldn t see him any  more  then he said       some  scout  hey          chapter xxxvii    tells about how i visited camp mc cord    of course  everybody in camp said that bert winton was a wonder  they  couldn t help saying that  his own troop didn t seem to think so much  about it  one of them said to me that he guessed bert was having the  time of his life  they were funny in that way  those tigers  they  didn t seem to get excited over him at all  none of them went around  shouting     the next morning everybody was talking about bert  all the time fellows  kept going over in boats to see the remains of nick s cove  and most  all they talked about was bert  some of them said  skinny wasn t worth  it  they meant being rescued like that  i could see they all thought  that he took the money  some said he was crazy  some of them thought he  knew about the money and just swam out for that     the elks didn t seem to care much  connie told a fellow that he thought  they had a peach  but it turned out to be a lemon  i guess he thought  that was funny  i told vic norris about how bert held skinny tight and  he said bert was some lemon squeezer  it made me mad and i just walked  away     i don t know what would have happened if mr  ellsworth had been there   i guessed he had the money still  because i knew he was called away in  a hurry  i didn t know whether he had sent for the cross or not     i don t know what the directors thought  i guessed maybe they decided  not to do anything till mr  ellsworth got back  anyway  skinny stayed  where he was  george bent  he s in a troop from washington  told me  that mr  storer went down to the hudson early in the morning to see how  everything was  i guess maybe he did  because temple camp would be  responsible for skinny until he was sent away  george said they gave  mr  storer a doughnut down there  and that it hurt him  i don t know  whether they threw it at him or gave it to him to eat  either way it  might have hurt him  anyway  i was glad skinny was away on account of  the way the fellows felt about him     the next afternoon westy and i hiked down to see the new camp  i have  to admit they had everything fine  those gold dust twins were older  than most of the fellows at camp and now that they had something  special to be interested in  i could see that they were pretty game      we re going to fight it out on these lines if it takes all summer    that s what one of them said     and the other one said   that s us   skinny forever       they seemed to be getting a lot of fun out of it anyway  i don t  believe either one of them knew much about the gold cross  but they  were going to see skinny win  it was funny to hear them talk about  scouting  the big one  the one called reggie  asked me if we had a  badge for dancing  can you beat that  he said he thought he might make  a stab for it  the other one thought that stalking meant picking corn  off the stalk   good night      they seemed to like bert a lot  but i guess it was skinny s going over  to see them that got them interested  when he asked them  please  to  believe in him and not take the money  that was what clinched it    that s what  i  think  anyway  that s what bert told me  he said that  was what started camp mccord     skinny was all bunged up but  oh  boy  you should have seen the scout  smile when he saw me  if that smile had been any longer it would have  cut his head off  he said he was a hero  and that he had a camp of his  own now  poor little duffer  he didn t mean to be boasting  it was only  that funny way he had     westy and bert and i took a little walk and i said   the only trouble  is  suppose we shouldn t get the letter  maybe the money doesn t belong  to the lieutenant  then what       well then  we ll find out who it does belong to  that s what   bert  said   camp mccord doesn t strike its colors as easily as all that  mr   what s his name back      i told him no  mr  ellsworth wasn t back yet  then i said   maybe  lieutenant donnelle was sent away  maybe he had to go to south africa  on account of the league of nations  i read that the zulu s were having  a war       you re a regular calamity jane   bert said   can t you think of  something better than that to worry about          chapter xxxviii    tells about the scout pace    we had it fixed that as soon as i got a letter i would start right down  to camp mccord with it  and  oh  boy  didn t i hang around  administration shack  where the camp mail was sorted  i guess my patrol  thought i was crazy and i bet that robin in the maple tree wondered  what had become of me  gee  you can say i was a calamity jane if you  want to  but honest  i had lieutenant donnelle sent all over the world   one minute i was saying he was dead  and the next minute i was saying  he had gone to russia  and the next minute i was saying the money  wasn t his at all  then i was saying that he d be mad  because i told  bert about him and wouldn t send any answer at all  then i d get to  thinking about bert and that would kind of cheer me up  because he was  so sure     three days went by and no letter came  every time they handed me a  letter i d be shaky all over till i saw who it was from  and then i d  just be all down and out when i d see it was from my mother or my  father  even the letters with my allowance in didn t make me feel good   so you can see from that how anxious i was     all the fellows around camp didn t say much about skinny  they thought  he was just a little thief  but anyway  they weren t the kind of  fellows to be always talking about it  they had something else to do   they talked a lot about bert though  and said he was a kind of a crank  about skinny  but anyway  they admitted that he was a hero  gee  they   had  to do that     all the while i didn t go down to see bert  and he didn t come up to  camp  i just didn t want to go unless i had the letter  reggie hiked up  one day and wanted to know if he could borrow a pair of smoked glasses    the fellows here don t smoke   doc carson told him  it was a shame to  guy him  he was such a nice fellow  but oh  boy  i had to laugh to see  him start back with that pair of big auto goggles on  but anyhow  all  the fellows admitted that the gold dust twins were all right  they were  terrible bunglers when it came to scouting  and they even laughed at  themselves  that was the best part of it  but you know what a tin horn  sport is  well  they weren t that  anyway  they had one of those long  fancy brass things with a wax taper to light their camp fire with   honest  it was a scream  i guess it was used in the parlor at home  to  reach the chandelier with     well  it got to be tuesday and no letter came  oh  wasn t i  discouraged  i just started out through the woods  because i didn t  want to see anybody  all of a sudden  who should i meet but pee wee  he  motioned to me to keep still  because he was stalking a hop toad  even  though i didn t feel much like laughing  i had to laugh      why don t you track an angleworm some day   i said     he said   what s the matter with you lately       nothing much   i told him      you don t hang out with the fellows at all   he said   we re having a  lot of thrilling adventures       thrilling  hey   i said  and i just had to laugh  because it was the  same old pee wee with his hair s breadth escapes and thrilling  adventures  and all that stuff      well   i said   you want to be careful  it s pretty dangerous business  stalking hop toads       i came all the way from catskill scout pace   he said     i said   bully for you       i did it in fifty two minutes   he said   scout pace is my middle  name  are you worrying about anything       i m worrying because i don t get a letter  kid   i said   if it  doesn t come to morrow        don t you worry   he said   it ll come to morrow  i ll fix it for  you       you re one bully little fixer   i said  because he was always talking  about fixing things    but if uncle sam doesn t bring it   you  can t   but  anyway  you and i are going to have a good hike  you little raving  raven   i said   just as soon as we can  i know i haven t seen much of  you  pee wee  but it isn t because i don t like you      he just said    hsh   and went off on tiptoe through the woods   stalking his hop toad  he s a mighty nice little fellow  pee wee is   and he s a bully little scout  scout pace and good turns  those are his  specialties  he just stalks hop toads on the side                                                 late that night mr  ellsworth came back  the bus brought him up from  catskill  i didn t see him  but early in the morning on my way over to  wait for the mail  i met vic norris and hunt ward of the elks     vic norris said   this ll be the end of camp mccord  mr  e  is going to  take skinny to bridgeboro this morning       oh  is that so   i said   skinny is with the gold dust twins  and they  have nothing to do with temple camp       skinny is in mr  ellsworth s care   hunt ward said      pretty soon he ll be in the reformatory s care   vic blurted out      yes   i said   and all because you had his head all turned with  swimming  before he s even passed his second class tests  you were glad  enough to use him  you were glad enough to see his poor little skinny  legs kicking in the water  just so as you could get something out of  it  now you throw him down  those gold dust twins are better scouts  than you are  they are  you re not fit to stay in the same camp with  bert winton  you re in my own troop  but i tell you that  you leave mr   ellsworth out of it       who says so   vic shouted      i say so   i told him   you don t hear mr  ellsworth around saying  mean things about skinny  do you  you leave mr  ellsworth out of it  it s none of your business what he does  even if skinny does go back   the least you can do is keep still about it  you don t hear those  tigers around talking  do you  i guess not  or my patrol either  you  keep your mouths shut about skinny      then i went over to administration shack to wait for the mail to be  sorted  the reason i didn t say more to vic and hunt was just because i  was getting discouraged  and in my heart i thought maybe skinny would  have to go  i knew that camp mccord was no use if mr  ellsworth said he  must go back     i was glad i didn t say any more  because anyway  there was no letter  there         chapter xxxix    tells about how camp mc cord didn t strike its colors    there were a lot of us hanging around administration shack  and i heard  a couple of fellows say that mr  ellsworth was going down in the bus to  catch the eleven ten train  they said he was going to stop at camp  mccord for skinny   he s likely to get a home made doughnut thrown at  his head   one of them said  and they all laughed  i just couldn t  listen to them     after the mail was distributed and i saw there wasn t anything for me   i just went in and said to slaty  i said   are you  sure  there isn t  anything  would you mind looking again   i knew it wasn t any use and i  guess he did too  but anyway  he looked and said no     then i started back to silver fox cabin  i guess i never felt worse  than i did then  first i thought i d just go and beg mr  ellsworth not  to take skinny away from camp mccord  anyway  even if he couldn t have  the cross  i was hanging my head and just kind of wandering along and  wondering what i d say to bert and the twins  i could just sort of see  that new flag with camp mccord on it  and i could hear bert saying    camp mccord doesn t strike its colors as easily as all that   anyway   what more could i do  i knew mr  ellsworth would be nice to me  but  that he wouldn t do anything just because  i  wanted him to  i said to  myself   it s all up  nobody can do anything now  skinny was born  unlucky  poor little kid       all of a sudden i stumbled plunk into pee wee as he came pell mell  around the corner of the big pavilion      what in    i began       i ve got it for you  i ve got it for you    he shouted   forty nine  minutes  scout pace   i beat my record   i thought maybe it wouldn t  come in the reg  in the reg  in the reg    he was so out of breath he  couldn t talk      there s a sec  there s a sec  there s a second train  here       and then he handed me a letter      there  there are  two   he said   this  one s  for you      my hand trembled so i could hardly open the envelope  and  honest  i  could hardly speak to him  i just blurted out   pee wee  you re the  bulliest little scout in this camp  you and your scout pacing  you re  just the best little scout that ever was  give me your hand  you bully  little raving raven  talk about good turns  oh  pee wee  you re just       honest  i couldn t finish  and i stood there with my eyes all sort of  wet  and watched him start up again scout pace      see you later   he called back   i want to make administration shack  in fifty minutes      that was him all over     this was the letter and  oh  boy  you bet i ll always keep it  because  that was my lucky day  even since then  wednesday has been my lucky  day  when i get a good stalking snapshot it s always on a wednesday     skeezeks  old pal     yours received  have sent letter to your superior officer or whatever  you call him  will be up after my two hundred buckarinos next week   could you put me up for a couple of nights  i ll show you how to roast  potatoes french style  and we ll have a hike     everything o k   so don t worry  you re a little brick     in a hurry     h d     believe me  i read that letter about seven times  but even then i  wouldn t go to see mr  ellsworth  because i wanted to wait till the  other letter was sent over to him from the shack  i guess i waited  about half an hour  because i wanted to give him a chance to read his  seven times too  then i went to his tent where i knew he d be getting  ready to start away     i just said kind of sober like   can i take your grip over to the bus  for you  mr  ellsworth      oh  boy  you ought to have seen him      guess you ll have to root around and find another good turn for  to day  roy   he said   something has happened      i just said very sober like  because i m not afraid of him    did  skinny take any more money   he said   here  read this  you little  silver fox  and then clear out and give me a chance to get my wits  together  you re right and i m wrong as you usually are  i mean as i  usually am  i don t know what i mean  here  read this and then let s  see your scout smile  you little rascal      this is how the letter read     mr  e  c ellsworth  temple camp     dear sir       may i ask you to go to the trouble of forcing open the second locker in  my father s house boat and rescuing a sum of money which i carelessly  left there  i think you will find it in an old pair of trousers  belonging to me  the amount is a little over two hundred dollars  i  would greatly appreciate it if you will hold this in safe keeping till  i have a chance to visit your camp  i hope you will not consider that i  am presuming upon a very slight acquaintance  in asking you to do me  this service     sincerely yours     lieutenant harry c  donnelle  stationed at camp dix  wrightstown  n  j     oh  boy  i wish i could tell you about everything  i don t know what  mr  ellsworth told the elks  i should worry about that  he knew how to  handle them  you can bet  oh  bibbie  but he s one peachy scoutmaster   pretty soon everybody in camp was talking  but i didn t pay any  attention  a fellow from virginia came up and told me they were going  to have the spring board fixed  what do you know about that  i said    get out from under and don t bother me  i have something else to think  about      i didn t eat much dinner  maybe you won t believe it  but i didn t   right afterward i started down to the hudson  i saw a woodchuck s  tracks  but i didn t bother with them  i should worry about woodchucks   i didn t even stop in the village to have a soda  i got some ice cream  in a paper  so i could eat it going along  and  oh  boy  when i saw  that new flag in among the trees  didn t i just shout   camp mccord    it said  in big red letters  oh  they were dandy fellows  those gold  dust twins  then i thought of what bert said about camp mccord not  striking its colors  i noticed they didn t have their door to the  south  but anyway  that didn t matter  the north is all right    sometimes     i just went running in there pell mell      hurrah for camp mccord   i shouted   you were right about not striking  your colors  but i ll strike you  all right  you old bengal tiger   and  i gave bert winton a thump that nearly knocked him over  good night      don t you know enough to have your door open to the south or east or  west  what s the difference   i just yelled   hurrah  lieutenant  donnelle is coming to get his two hundred and i m going to make him  stay till skin  i mean alfred  gets the cross  three cheers for the  gold dust twins  and anybody who says        just a minute   bert said   calm down  you re talking in chunks       why shouldn t i talk in chunks  i d like to know   i said     then i told them all about it      it s going to be just as you said   i told them   we re going to make  the elks come down here and give him the cross  when it comes  mr   ellsworth says all right  oh  but he was fine about it he said it s  only fair  isn t he some scoutmaster  but you don t have to be in the  scouts       the fellow they called reggie just came over and put his hand over my  shoulder  awful nice   yes  you do   he said   you have to be in the  scouts  we won t hear any talk against the scouts here      oh  but he was one fine fellow  i don t care if he didn t know anything  about digging a drain ditch and all that  but anyway  i just can t tell  you all we said     and one thing  you should have seen skinny  that s all i ve got to  say  you ought to have seen him     after a little while  when the rumpus was over  bert and i walked over  to the shore of the river and sat down and just looked across at  catskill and the big hills in back  i kind of felt as if i d like to be  alone with him a little while     i said   you did it all  bert  the whole camp is crazy about you       those campers are bully scouts   he said     i said   yes  but  you   if it wasn t for  you         if it wasn t for pee wee  skinny would be on that train   he said     we listened and could hear the west shore train coming along and could  see the smoke blowing away into the mountains  it seemed as if that  train didn t care for anything or anybody  pretty soon it would be in  the hot city and the people on it would go through big gates and across  in ferries and up the streets all filled with people  and everything  would be hot and stuffy     but skinny wouldn t be on it     we saw it stop at the station in catskill and we heard the bell ring  and saw it start again and go scooting along the shore and far away   till we couldn t see it any more  only the smoke     but anyway  skinny wasn t on it      kind of  as you might say  pee wee can even beat a train  going scout  pace   i said      it ll go winding and turning in and out along the shore   bert said    but pee wee can beat it on good turns       yop   i said     after that we didn t say anything for about five minutes     then i said   one thing sure   you  ought to get the gold cross      he didn t say anything  only broke a stick off a bush and began marking  on the grass with it      what do i want with the cross   he said      it s a big honor   i told him      sure   he said      you deserve it for what you did   i told him   you ought to  want   it  you ought to want to have it  on account of your patrol       nice fellows  eh   he said      well then  why don t you take more interest in it for  their  sake       ever notice how blue the hudson is above poughkeepsie   he said     i didn t say anything  just looked at the river  then all of a sudden a  thought came to me     i said   bert  you ve got the cross already  haven t you  why didn t  you tell me       dunno  didn t think of it  i guess   he said      tell me how you won it  bert   i said    please  tell me      but he just kept poking around with the stick and wouldn t tell me      look at that worm   he said  and he held one up on his stick   good  fishing bait around here  hey  what d ye say we go back      that was just like him   just exactly like him         illustration   let go  i ve got him              he added as the train rushed around a sharp curve and nearly  threw him from his chair      i hope we get to ashton on time   remarked tom rover   i want to take  a look around the grounds before it gets dark       that s tom  wanting to see it all before he sleeps   cried sam rover  with a grin   you look out  tom  that you don t get into disgrace the  first thing  as you did when we went to putnam hall don t you remember  that giant firecracker  and how josiah crabtree locked you up in a  cell for setting it off       ugh  will i ever forget it   groaned tom  making a wry face   but  i got the best of old crabtree  didn t i   he continued  his face  brightening      wonder if we ll make as many friends at college as we did at putnam  hall   remarked dick rover   those were jolly times and no mistake   think of the feasts  and the hazings  and the baseball and football   and the rackets with the pornell students  and all that       speaking of hazing  i heard that some of the hazing at the college  we re bound for is fierce   came from sam rover      well  we ll have to stand for what comes  sam   answered his big  brother   no crying quit  here       right you are  dick   said tom   at the same time if  great caesar s  ghost  what s up now      as tom uttered the last words a shrill whistle from the locomotive  pierced the air  then came the sudden gripping of the air brakes on  the car wheels  and the express came to a stop with a shock that  pitched all the passengers from their seats  tom and sam went  sprawling in a heap in the aisle and dick came down on top of them      hi  get off of me   spluttered sam  who was underneath      what s the matter  have we run into another train   asked tom as he  pushed dick to one side and arose      i don t know   answered the older brother   something is wrong   that s certain       are you hurt  sam   asked tom as he helped the youngest rover to his  feet      no  not much   was the panting reply   say  we stopped in a hurry all  right  didn t we      with the shock had come loud cries from the other people in the car   and it was found that one young lady had fainted  everybody wanted to  know what was the matter  but nobody could answer the question  the  colored porter ran to the platform and opened the vestibule door  tom  followed the man and so did sam and dick      freight train ahead  off the track   announced tom   we ran into the  last car       let us go up front and see how bad it is   returned dick   maybe this  will tie us up here for hours       oh  i hope not   cried sam   i want to get to the college just as  soon as possible  i m dying to know what it s like       we can be thankful we were not hurt  sam   said his older brother    if our engineer hadn t stopped the train as he did we might have had  a fearful smashup       i know it   answered sam soberly  and then the boys walked forward to  learn the full extent of the damage done and what prospects there were  of continuing their journey     to my old readers the lads just mentioned will need no special  introduction  but for the benefit of those who have not read the  previous volumes in this  rover boys series  let me state that the  brothers were three in number  dick being the oldest  fun loving tom  coming next and sam the youngest  they were the sons of one anderson  rover  a rich widower  and when at home lived with their father and an  aunt and an uncle on a beautiful farm called valley brook     from the farm  and while their father was in africa  the boys had been  sent by their uncle randolph to school  as related in the first book  of the series  called  the rover boys at school   at this place   called putnam hall  they made many friends and also a few enemies and  had  the time of their lives   as tom often expressed it     a term at school had been followed by a short trip on the ocean  and  then the boys  in company with their uncle  went to the jungles of  africa to rescue mr  rover  who was a captive of a savage tribe of  natives  after that came trips out west  and to the great lakes  and  to the mountains  and  returning to school  the lads went into camp  with the other cadets  then they took another long trip on land and  sea and led a crusoe like life on an island of the pacific ocean      i think we d better settle down now   said dick on returning home  from being cast away  but this was not to be  they took a house boat  trip down the ohio and the mississippi rivers  had a number of  adventures on the plains and then found themselves in southern waters   where they solved the mystery of a deserted steam yacht     they returned to the farm and to putnam hall  and for a time matters  went along quietly  on account of attending to some business for his  father  dick had fallen somewhat behind in his studies  and tom and  sam did their best to catch up to him  and  as a consequence  all  three of the youths graduated from putnam hall at the same time      and now for college   sam had said  and all were anxious to know  where their parent intended to send them next but instead of settling  this question mr  rover came forward with a proposition that was as  novel as it was inviting  this was nothing less than to visit a spot  in the west indies  known as treasure isle  and made a hunt for a  large treasure secreted there during a rebellion in one of the central  american countries      a treasure hunt  just the thing   dick had said  and his brothers  agreed with him  the lads were filled with excitement over the  prospect  and for the time being all thoughts of going to college were  thrust aside     from mr  rover it was learned that the treasure belonged to the estate  of a mr  stanhope  who had died some years before  mr  stanhope s  widow was well known to the rover boys  and dick thought that dora  stanhope  the daughter  was the finest girl in the whole world  there  was also another relative  a mrs  laning  the late mr  stanhope s  sister  who was to share in the estate  and she had two daughters   grace and nellie  two young ladies who were especial favorites with  sam and tom      oh  we ve got to find that treasure   said tom   think of what it  means to the stanhopes and the lanings       they ll be rich  and they deserve to be   answered his brother sam   it may be added here that the rovers were wealthy  so they did not  begrudge the treasure to others     a steam yacht was chartered and a party was made up  consisting of the  rovers  several of the boys  school chums  mrs  stanhope and dora and  mrs  laning and grace and nellie  the steam yacht carried a fine crew  and also an old tar called bahama bill  who knew the exact location of  the treasure     before sailing it was learned that some rivals were also after the  treasure  one of these was a sharper named sid merrick  who had on  several occasions tried to get the best of the rovers and failed  with  merrick was tad sobber  his nephew  a youth who at putnam hall had  been a bitter foe to dick  tom and sam  sobber had sent the rovers a  box containing a live poisonous snake  but the snake got away and bit  another pupil  this lad knew all about the sending of the reptile and  he exposed tad sobber  and the latter  growing alarmed  ran away from  the school     the search for the treasure proved a long one  and sid merrick and tad  sobber did all in their power to keep the wealth from falling into the  hands of the rovers and their friends  but the rovers won out in the  quest and sailed away with the treasure on board the steam yacht  the  vessel of their enemies followed them  but a hurricane came up and the  other ship was lost with nearly all on board      well  that s the end of sid merrick and tad sobber   said dick when  he heard this news   if they are at the bottom of the atlantic ocean  they can t bother us any more   but dick was mistaken in his surmise   it was true that sid merrick had been drowned  but tad sobber was  alive  having been rescued by a schooner bound for london  and he  was now on his way back to the united states  more bitter than ever  against the rovers  and with a determination to do all in his power  to bring dick  tom and sam to grief and gain possession of the money  which he and his uncle had claimed belonged to them instead of to the  stanhope estate     on arriving at philadelphia from the west indies the treasure was  deposited in a strong box of a local trust company  from it the  expenses of the trip were paid  and the sailors who had aided in the  search were suitably rewarded  later on the balance of the treasure  was divided according to the terms of mr  stanhope s will  this placed  a large sum of money in the hands of mrs  stanhope  both for herself  and dora  and also a goodly amount in the hands of mrs  laning for  herself and grace and nellie     the stanhopes had always been fairly well off  but not so the lanings   john laning was a farmer  and this sudden change to riches bewildered  him      why  mother   he said to his wife   whatever will you and the gals do  with the money       several things  john   she answered   in the first place  you are not  going to work so hard and in the next place the girls are going to  have a better education       well  i m not afraid of work   answered the farmer   about  eddication  if they want it  well  it s their money and they can have  all the learnin  they want       dora is going to a boarding school and nellie and grace want to go  with her   went on mrs  laning      where is dora going       to a place called hope seminary  her mother knows the lady who is the  principal       well  if it s a good place  i reckon the gals can go too  but it will  be terrible lonesome here without  em       i know  john  but we want the girls to be somebody  now they have  money  don t we       sure we do   answered mr  laning readily     so it was arranged that the three girls should go to hope seminary   located several miles from the town of ashton  in one of the central  states  in the meantime the rover boys were speculating on what  college they were to attend  yale was mentioned  and harvard and  princeton  and also several institutions located in the middle west      boys  wouldn t you like to go to brill college   asked their father  one day   that s a fine institution  not quite so large as some but  just as good   and he smiled in a peculiar manner      brill  where is that   asked dick      it is near the town of ashton  about two miles from hope seminary   the school dora stanhope and the laning girls are going to attend    and mr  rover smiled again      brill college for mine   said sam promptly and in a manner that made  his brothers laugh      sam wants to be near grace   said tom      well  don t you want to be near nellie   retorted the youngest rover      of course i do  and i reckon dick won t be angry at being where he  can occasionally see dora   went on the fun loving rover with a sly  wink   of course it s nice enough to write letters and send boxes of  chocolates by mail  but it s a good deal better to take a stroll in  the moonlight and hold hands  eh  dick       is that what you do   asked dick  but his face grew very red as he  spoke      never in the wide  wide world   cried tom      i leave that for my sentimental brothers  big and little       who is sentimental   exclaimed sam   maybe i don t remember you and  nellie on the deck of the steam yacht that moonlight night        aw  cut it out   muttered tom  he turned to his father  who had been  called from the room for a moment   if you think brill college a good  one  dad  it will suit me       and it will suit me  too   added sam      i mentioned brill for two reasons   explained mr  rover   the one was  because it is near hope seminary and the other is because i happen to  know the president  dr  john wallington  quite well  in fact  we  went to school together  he is a fine gentleman  as fine a fellow as  captain putnam  and i am sure his college must be a good one       if it s as good as dear old putnam hall  i shall be well content    answered dick      then you are satisfied to go there  dick       yes  sir      so it was settled and arrangements were at once made for the three  boys to go to brill  fortunately it was found that their diplomas  from putnam hall would admit them to the freshmen class without  examination  all of the boys wrote letters to the girls and received  answers in return     the college was to open two weeks before the seminary  so that to  journey to ashton together would be out of the question      well  we ll see the girls later  anyway   said dick   i hope they  like it at hope and we like it at brill  then we ll have some splendid  times together       right you are   answered sam  and tom said the same     at last came the day for the boys to leave home  trunks and dress suit  cases were packed  and not only their father but also their uncle  randolph and their aunt martha went to the depot to see them off      now be good and take care of yourselves   said mr  rover on parting      learn all you can   added uncle randolph   remember that knowledge is  better than wealth       oh  i m going to cram my head full of learning this trip   answered  tom with a grin      take care of yourselves and don t get sick   was aunt martha s  warning   if you do  get a doctor right away   and then she gave each  of the boys a warm  motherly kiss and a hug  she thought the lads the  very best in all this wide world     the train came and the boys were off  after a two hours  ride they  had to change to the main line and got into the parlor car already  mentioned  then they had dinner in the diner and went back to the  other car to read and to look at the scenery  thus several hours  slipped by  when of a sudden came the jar and shock that told them  something out of the ordinary had happened           chapter ii    at the sanderson house      when the rover boys reached the head of the train they found an  excited crowd beginning to collect  the locomotive of the express had  cut into the last freight car a distance of several feet  smashing a  number of boxes and barrels and likewise the headlight of the engine   nobody had been hurt  for which everybody was thankful  but the  engineer of the express was very angry      why didn t you send a man back with a flag or put a torpedo on the  track   he demanded of the freight train conductor      did send a man back   was the answer   but he didn t go back far  enough  hadn t time  this happened only a few minutes ago       you can t expect me to stop in a hundred feet   growled the engineer   as a matter of fact he had not stopped in many times that distance      well  i did what i could   grumbled the freight conductor     by making inquiries the rover boys learned that the freight train had  jumped a frog at a switch and part of the cars were on one track and  part on another  two trucks were broken  and nobody could tell how  long it would take to clear the track upon which the express stood      may be an hour  but more likely it will be six or eight   said one of  the brakemen to tom   this section of the road is the worst managed of  the lot       and how far is it to ashton   asked dick      about twelve miles by the railroad       then walking is out of the question   came from sam   i shouldn t  mind hoofing it if it was two or three       the railroad has to run around the hill yonder   went on the train  hand   if you go up the tracks for a quarter of a mile you ll come to  a country road that will take you right into ashton  and the distance  from there isn t more than seven or eight miles       any houses on that road   asked tom      of course  farmhouses all along       then come on   went on tom to his brothers   we can hire a carriage  to take us to ashton and to the college  some farmer will be glad of  the chance to earn the money       let us wait and see if the train moves first   answered dick      she won t move just yet   answered the brakeman with a sickly grin     the boys stood around for a quarter of an hour and then decided to  walk up to the country road that had been mentioned  their trunks were  checked through  but they had their dress suit cases with them      we ll have to carry these   said sam dolefully      let us see if we can t check them   returned his big brother  but  this was impossible  for the baggage car was locked and they could not  find the man who had charge of it      oh  well  come on   said tom   the cases are not so heavy  and it is  a fine day for walking   and off he started and his brothers followed  him     it was certainly a fine day  as tom said  it was early september   clear and cool  with a faint breeze blowing from the west  on the way  they passed an apple orchard  laden with fruit  and they stopped long  enough to get some      i declare this is better than sitting in that stuffy car   remarked  sam as he munched on an apple   i am glad to stretch my legs       if we don t have to stretch them too long   remarked dick      say  i wonder if we ll pass anywhere near hope seminary   cried tom    it may be on this road       what of it   returned his younger brother   the girls are not here  yet  won t be for two weeks       oh  we might get a view of the place anyway  sam       i want to see brill first   came from dick   if that doesn t suit  us    he ended with a sigh      oh  it will suit  you can bet on it   cried sam   father wouldn t  send us there if he wasn t sure it would be o k  he s as much  interested as we are      walking along the highway  which ran down to a little milk station  on the railroad  the three boys soon discovered a farmhouse nestling  between some trees and bushes  they threw their baggage on the grass  and walked up to the front door     they had to knock several times before their summons was answered   then an old lady opened the door several inches and peeped out      what do you want   she demanded in a cracked voice      good afternoon   said dick politely   can we hire somebody to drive  us to ashton  we were on the train  but there has been a smash up  and  we        land sakes alive  a smash up  did you say   cried the old lady      yes  madam       was my son jimmie killed       nobody was killed or even hurt       sure of that  my son jimmie went to crawford yesterday an  was coming  back this afternoon  sure he wasn t on that train       if he was he wasn t hurt   answered dick   can we hire a carriage to  take us to ashton       how did it happen  that accident       the express ran into the end of a freight train       land sakes alive  the freight  maybe it was the one we sent the cows  away on  was there any cows killed  do you know       i don t think so       well  tell me the particulars  will you  i don t go out much an  so i  don t hear nuthin   but an accident  ain t it awful  but i always  said it was risky to ride on the railroad  i told jimmie so a hundred  times  but he would go to crawford an  now maybe he s a corpse  you  are sure you didn t see a tall  thin young man  with a wart on his  chin  that was cut up       what do you mean  the wart or the young man   asked tom  who was  bound to have his fun      why  the young man o  course  although i allow if he was cut up the  wart would be  too  poor boy  i warned him a hundred        can we hire a carriage here or not   demanded dick  the talk was  growing a little tiresome to him      no  you can t   snapped the old lady   we never hire out our  carriage  if we did it would soon go to pieces       is there anybody who can drive us to brill college  we ll pay for the  service  of course       no  but you might get a carriage over to the sanderson place       where is that   asked sam      up the road a piece   and the old lady motioned with her head as she  spoke   but now  if my son jimmie was in that accident        good day  madam   said dick and walked away  and sam and tom did the  same  the old lady continued to call after them  but they paid no  attention      poor jimmie  if he isn t killed in a railroad accident  he ll be  talked to death some day   was sam s comment      don t you care  we know that jimmie s got a wart  anyway   observed  tom  and he said this so dryly his brothers had to laugh   always add  to your fund of knowledge when you can   he added  in imitation of his  uncle randolph      i hope we have better success at the next farmhouse   said sam    i don t know that i want to walk all the way to ashton with this  dress suit case       oh  we re bound to find some kind of a rig at one place or another    said dick   all the folks can t be like that old woman      they walked along the road until they came in sight of a second  farmhouse  also set in among trees and bushes  a neat gravel path   lined with rose bushes  ran from the gate to the front piazza      this looks nice   observed sam   some folks of the better sort must  live here      the three boys walked up to the front piazza and set down their  baggage  on the door casing was an electric push button      no old fashioned knocker here   observed dick as he gave the button a  push      well  we are not wanting electric push buttons   said tom   an  electric runabout or a good two seat carriage will fill our bill      the boys waited for fully a minute and then  as nobody came to answer  their summons  dick pushed the button again      i don t hear it   said sam   perhaps it doesn t ring       probably it rings in the back of the house   answered his big  brother     again the boys waited  and while they did so all heard talking at a  distance      somebody in the kitchen  i guess   said tom   maybe we had better go  around there  some country folks don t use their front doors excepting  for funerals and when the minister comes      leaving their dress suit cases on the piazza  the rover boys walked  around the side of the farmhouse in the direction of the kitchen   the building was a low and rambling one and they had to pass a  sitting room  here they found a window wide open to let in the fresh  air and sunshine      now  you must go  really you must   they heard in a girl s voice   i  haven t done a thing this afternoon  and what will papa say when he  gets back       oh  that s all right  minnie   was the answer in masculine tones    you like us to be here  you know you do  and  remember  we haven t  seen you in a long time       yes  i know  mr  flockley  but        oh  don t call me mr  flockley  call me dudd       yes  and please don t call me mr  koswell   broke in another  masculine voice   jerry is good enough for me every time       but you must go now  you really must   said the girl      we ll go if you ll say good by in the right kind of a way  eh  dudd    said the person called jerry koswell      yes  minnie  but we won t go until you do that   answered the young  man named dudd flockley      wha  what do you mean   faltered the girl  and now  looking through  the sitting room window and through a doorway leading to the kitchen   the rover boys saw a pretty damsel of sixteen standing by a pantry  door  facing two dudish young men of eighteen or twenty  the young men  wore checkered suits and sported heavy watch fobs and diamond rings  and scarf pins      why  you ll give us each a nice kiss  won t you   said dudd flockley  with a smile that was meant to be alluring      of course minnie will give us a kiss   said jerry koswell   next  saturday i m coming over to give you a carriage ride       i don t wish any carriage ride   answered the girl coldly  her face  had gone white at the mention of kisses      well  let s have the kisses anyway   cried dudd flockley  and  stepping forward  he caught the girl by one hand  while jerry koswell  grasped her by the other      oh  please let me go   cried the girl   please do  oh  mr  flockley   mr  koswell  don t  don t  please       now be nice about it   growled dudd flockley      it won t hurt you a bit   added jerry koswell      i want you to let me go   cried the girl      i will as soon as    began dudd flockley  and then he gave a sudden  roar of pain as he found himself caught by the ear  then a hand caught  him by the arm and he was whirled around and sent into a corner with a  crash  at the same time jerry koswell was tackled and sent down in a  heap in another corner  the girl  thus suddenly released  stared at  the newcomers in astonishment and then sank down on a chair  too much  overcome to move or speak           chapter iii    like knights of old      the rover boys had acted on the impulse of the moment  they had seen  that the girl wanted the two dudish young men to leave her alone  and  stepping into the kitchen  dick had tackled dudd flockley while tom  and sam had given their attention to jerry koswell      you cowards   cried dick  confronting flockley   why can t you leave  a young lady alone when she tells you to       they ought to be kicked out of the house   added tom      you  you    spluttered dudd flockley  he did not know what to say  he  gathered himself up hastily and jerry koswell followed   who are you    he demanded  facing dick with clenched fists      never mind who i am   was the reply of the oldest rover   aren t you  ashamed of yourself       this is none of your affair   came from koswell      well  we made it our affair   answered tom  he turned to the girl  i  hope we did right   he added hastily      why  er  yes  i think so   faltered the girl  she was still very  white and trembling   but  but i hope you didn t hurt them       see here  minnie  are you going to stand for this   growled dudd  flockley   it ain t fair  we re old friends  and        you had no right to touch me  mr  flockley   answered the girl   i  told you to let me go  i  i thought you were a  a  gentleman   and now  the tears began to show in minnie sanderson s eyes      i am a gentleman       you didn t act like one       oh  come  don t get prudish  minnie   put in jerry koswell   we  didn t mean any harm  we        i want you to leave this house   said the girl  with a sudden show  of spirit   you had no warrant to act as you did  it  it was  was  shameful  leave at once   and she stamped her small foot on the floor   her anger was beginning to show itself and her face lost its whiteness  and became crimson      we ll leave when we please   muttered dudd flockley      so we will   added jerry koswell     on the instant dick looked at his brothers  and the three advanced on  the two dudish looking young men      you do as the young lady says   said dick in a cold  hard voice   i  don t know you  but you are not wanted here  and that is enough  go    and he pointed to the door      see here    blustered flockley  but he got no further  for dick  suddenly wheeled him around and gave him a shove that sent him through  the doorway and off the back porch      now the other fellow   said the oldest rover  but before tom and  sam could touch jerry koswell that individual ducked and ran after  flockley  then both young men stood at a safe distance      we ll fix you for this   roared flockley   we don t know who you are   but we ll find out  and        maybe you want a thrashing right now   came from tom impulsively    i m in fighting trim  if you want to know it   and he stepped out  of the house  with sam at his heels  dick followed  at this hostile  movement flockley and koswell turned and walked hurriedly out of the  garden and down the country road  a row of trees soon hiding them from  view      they are as mad as hornets   observed sam   if they belong anywhere  near ashton we ll have to look out for them       right you are   answered tom   but i am not particularly afraid      having watched the two young men out of sight  the three rover boys  returned to the farmhouse  minnie sanderson had now recovered somewhat  and she blushed deeply as she faced them      oh  wasn t it awful   she said   i  i don t know what you think of  it  they had no right to touch me  i thought they were gentlemen  they  have called here several times  but they never acted that way before       then we came in the nick of time   answered dick   will you allow me  to introduce myself   and he bowed   my name is dick rover and this  is my brother tom and this my brother sam  you are miss sanderson  i  suppose       yes  minnie sanderson       we are strangers here  we were on the train  but there was a little  accident and we were in a hurry to get to ashton  so we got off and  walked up this road  thinking we could hire somebody to drive us to  brill college       oh  do you go to brill   and the girl s eyes opened widely      we don t go yet  but we are going       then  then you ll meet mr  flockley and mr  koswell again       what  are they students there   cried tom      yes  this is their second year  i believe  i know they were there  last spring  for they called here      sam gave a low whistle      we are making friends first clip  aren t we   he murmured to his  brothers     the boys related a few of the particulars of the accident and their  experience at the farmhouse near the railroad      oh  that s old mrs  craven   cried minnie sanderson   she would talk  you out of your senses if you d let her  but about a carriage  i don t  know  if papa was here       at that moment came the sound of carriage wheels on the gravel path  near the barn      there is papa now   cried minnie sanderson   you can talk to him  i  guess he ll take you to the college quick enough       how did those two young fellows get here   asked sam      i don t know  and please  that is  you won t say anything to my  father about that  will you  it would make him very angry  and i don t  know what he d do       we ll not say a word if you wish it that way   answered dick      i don t think they ll bother me again after the way you treated  them   added the girl     she led them toward the barn and introduced her father  a fat and  jolly farmer of perhaps fifty  mr  sanderson had been off on a short  drive with one horse and he readily agreed to take them to brill  college for two dollars      just wait till i put in a fresh team   he said   then i ll get you  over to the college in less than an hour and a quarter      while he was hooking up he explained that he had been to a nearby  village for a dry battery for the electric doorbell      we don t use the bell much  but i hate to have it out of order   he  explained      that s why it didn t ring   said sam to his brothers     the carriage was soon ready and the three dress suit cases were piled  in the rear  then the boys got in and mr  sanderson followed      good by   called the boys to minnie sanderson      good by   she returned sweetly and waved her hand      maybe we ll get down this way again some day   said dick      if you do  stop in   returned the girl     the farmer s team was a good one and they trotted out of the yard  and into the road in fine shape  dick was beside the driver and his  brothers were in the rear  the carriage left a cloud of dust behind as  it bowled along over the dry country road      first year at brill   inquired mr  sanderson on the way      yes   answered dick      fine place  no better in the world  so i ve heard some folks say  and  they had been to some of the big colleges  too       yes  we ve heard it was all right   said tom   by the way  where is  hope seminary       about two miles this side of brill       then we ll pass it  eh   came from sam      well  not exactly  it s up a bit on a side road  but you can see the  buildings  very nice  too  although not so big as those up to brill   i ll point  em out to you when we get there       do you know any of the fellows at brill   questioned tom  nudging sam  in the ribs as he spoke      a few  minnie met some of  em at the baseball and football games  and  once in a while one of  em stops at our house  but we are most too far  away to see much of  em      presently the carriage passed through a small village which the boys  were told was called rushville      i don t know why they call it that   said mr  sanderson with a  chuckle   ain t no rushes growing around here  and there ain t no rush  either  it s as dead as a salted mackerel   and he chuckled again    but there s one thing here worth knowing about   he added suddenly      what s that   asked dick      the jamison place  it s haunted       haunted   cried tom   what  a house       yes  a big  old fashioned house  set in a lot of trees  it ain t been  occupied for years  and the folks say it s haunted  and nobody goes  near it       we ll have to inspect it some day   said sam promptly      what  you   cried the fat farmer      sure       ain t you scared       no   answered the youngest rover   i don t believe in ghosts       well  they say it s worth a man s life to go in that house   especially after dark       i think i d risk it       so would i   added tom      we ll pay the haunted house a visit some day when there is no session  at the college   said dick  it will give us something to do       hum   mused the farmer   well  if you do it you ve got backbone   that s all i ve got to say  the folks around here won t go near that  jamison place nohow      the road now became hilly  with many twists and turns  and the farmer  had to give his entire attention to his team  the carriage bounced up  and down and once sam came close to being pitched out      say  this is fierce   he cried   how much more of it       not more n a quarter of a mile   answered mr  sanderson   it is  kinder rough  ain t it  the roadmaster ought to have it fixed  some of  the bumps is pretty bad      there was one more small hill to cross  and then they came to a level  stretch  here the horses made good time and the farmer  let them out   in a fashion that pleased the boys very much      a fine team and no mistake   said dick  and this pleased mr   sanderson very much  for he was proud of but two things  his daughter  minnie and his horses      there is hope seminary   said mr  sanderson presently and pointed to  a group of buildings set in among some large trees   that s a good  school  i ve been thinking of sending my daughter there  only it s a  pretty long drive  and i need her at home  you see   he explained    minnie keeps house for me  has ever since my wife died  three years  ago      the boys gazed at the distant seminary buildings with interest  and as  they did so dick thought of dora stanhope and tom and sam remembered  the lanings  all thought how jolly it would be to live so close  together during the college term      now we ve got only two miles more   said mr  sanderson as he set  his team on a trot again   i ll land you at brill inside of fifteen  minutes  even if the road ain t none of the best      the country road ran directly into the town of ashton  but there was  a short cut to the college and they turned into this  soon the lads  caught sight of the pile of buildings in the distance  they were set  in a sort of park  with the road running in front and a river in the  rear  out on the grounds and down by the stream the rover boys saw a  number of students walking around and standing in groups talking     with a crack of his whip mr  sanderson whirled from the road into the  grounds and drove up to the steps of the main building      this is the place where new students report   he said with a smile    i ll take your grips over to the dormitory       thank you  mr  sanderson   said dick   and here are your two  dollars   and he handed the money over     while dick was paying the farmer sam turned to the back of the  carriage to look at the dress suit cases  he gave an exclamation      what s the matter   asked tom      didn t you have a suit case  tom       certainly       well  it s gone            chapter iv    what happened at the campus fence       gone       yes  gone are you sure you put it in the carriage       positive   was tom s answer   i put it on top of yours and dick s       then it must have jounced out somewhere on the road       what s up   asked dick  catching a little of the talk      tom s case is gone  he put it on top of ours  and i suppose coming  over that rough road jounced it out       one of the satchels gone  eh   came from mr  sanderson   sure you put  it in       yes  i am positive       too bad  reckon i d better go back at once and pick it up       i ll go with you   said tom     the matter was talked over for a minute and then tom and the farmer  rentered the carriage and drove off  as they did this a man came out  to meet dick and sam      new students   he asked shortly      yes   replied dick      please step this way      the doorman led them along a broad hall and into a large office  here  they signed a register and were then introduced by an under teacher  to dr  wallington  a gray haired man of sixty  tall and thin  with a  scholarly aspect  the president of brill shook hands cordially      i feel that i know you young gentlemen   he said   your father and i  were old school chums  i hope you like it here and that your coming  will do you much good       thank you  i hope so too   answered dick  and sam said about the  same  the two boys felt at once that the doctor would prove their  friend so long as they conducted themselves properly  but they also  felt that the aged president of brill would stand for no nonsense     having been questioned by the doctor and one of the teachers  the boys  were placed in charge of the house master  who said he would show  them to their rooms in the dormitory  dick had already explained the  absence of tom      your father wrote that you would prefer to room together   said  the house master   but that will be impossible  since our rooms  accommodate but two students each  we have assigned samuel and thomas  to room no     and richard to room no      next door       and who will i have with me   asked dick with interest  he did not  much fancy having a stranger      well  we were going to place a boy with you named stanley browne  a  very fine lad  but day before yesterday we received a new application  and the applicant said he desired very much to be put with the rovers   so he can go with you  if you wish it       who was the applicant   asked dick quickly      john a  powell  he said he was an old school chum of yours at putnam  hall and had been on a treasure hunt with you during the past summer       songbird   cried dick  and his face broke out in a smile   oh  that s  good news  it suits me perfectly       did you call the young man songbird   queried the house master      yes  that s his nickname       then he must be a singer       no  he composes poetry  or at least verses that he calls poetry    answered the eldest rover      i wish some more of the old putnam hall crowd were coming   put in  sam   think of having hans mueller here   and the very idea made him  grin      hans isn t fit for college yet  sam  but there may be others   added  dick hopefully     they soon reached the dormitory  located across the campus from the  main building and followed the house master up stairs and to rooms  no     and     each was bright  clean and cheerful  with big windows  looking to the southward  each contained two clothes closets  two  beds  two bookshelves  a bureau  a reading table  two plain chairs and  a rocker  the walls were bare  but the boys were told they could hang  up what they pleased so long as they did not mar the plaster      the lavatories are at the end of the hall   said the house master    and the trunk room is there  too  have you had the trunks sent up  yet       no  sir   answered dick      then let me have your checks and i will attend to it  i see the man  has already brought up your suit cases  i hope your brother has no  trouble in recovering the one that was lost       when is john powell coming   asked dick      to morrow  so he telegraphed      the house master left dick and sam and the two boys looked over the  rooms and put some of the things from their suit cases in the closets  and in the bureaus  then they walked down to one of the lavatories and  washed and brushed up  everything was so new and strange to them that  they did not feel at all at home      it will take a few days to get used to it i suppose   said sam  with  a trace of a sigh   i know i felt the same way when first i went to  putnam hall       let us go down and take a look around and watch for tom   replied his  brother   say  but i m glad songbird is coming   he added   i don t  care much for his doggerel  but john s a good fellow just the same       none better   replied sam heartily   and his poetry isn t so very  bad  always      the two brothers went below and strolled around  they found the main  building formed the letter t  with the top to the front  in this were  the offices and the classroom and also the private apartments of the  president and his family and some of the faculty  to the east of the  main building was a long  one story structure  containing a library  and a laboratory  and to the west the three story dormitory the lads  had just left  somewhat to the rear was another dormitory and beside  it a large gymnasium  with a swimming pool attached  a short distance  away was a house for the hired help and a stable and carriage sheds   down by the river was a boathouse  not unlike that at putnam hall but  larger      this is a fine layout and no mistake   observed dick with  satisfaction      did you see that fine athletic field beyond the campus   returned  sam   that means baseball and football galore      having walked around the outside of the various buildings the rover  boys made their way to the highway to watch for the coming of tom   hardly had they reached the road when they saw a crowd of six students  approaching  among the number were dudd flockley and jerry koswell      see those two  dick   whispered sam   won t they be mad when they see  us here       well  i don t care   answered dick coolly   if they say anything  let  me do the talking   and thus speaking  dick sat down on the top of a  stone fence and his brother hopped up beside him     the six students came closer  and of a sudden dudd flockley espied the  rovers  he stopped short and pulled his crony by the arm  and jerry  koswell likewise stared at dick and sam      you here   demanded flockley  coming closer and scowling at the  youths on the fence      we are   answered dick briefly      freshmen       yes       humph   and flockley put as much of a sneer as possible in the  exclamation      how did you get here   asked koswell      got a carriage at the sanderson place   answered sam with a grin      you did   cried flockley   say  you re a fresh lot  aren t you   he  went on  glaring at dick and sam   where s the third chap       none of your business   answered dick sharply      don t you talk to me like that   cried dudd flockley  and then his  face took on a look of cunning   freshmen  eh  then you don t know  what we are  we are sophs  and we want you to answer us decently       that s the talk   cried koswell   boys  these are freshmen  and on  the fence  too  we can t allow this  can we       no freshies allowed on that fence   answered another boy of the  crowd   off you go and quick      as he spoke he approached sam and tried to catch him by the foot to  pull him off  sam drew in his foot and then sent it forth so suddenly  that it took the sophomore in the stomach and sent him reeling to the  grass      at them   yelled flockley   show them how they must behave  sophs to  the front       wait   the command came from dick  and he spoke so clearly and firmly  that all the sophomores paused   is this an affair between flockley  and koswell and ourselves or is it simply two freshmen against six  sophs       why  er  have flockley and koswell anything against you two    demanded one of the boys curiously      i think so   answered dick   we had the pleasure of knocking them  both down a few hours ago  as it was a private affair  we won t go  into details       didn t do it because you were freshmen   asked another lad      not at all  we were total strangers when the thing occurred       yes  but    came from another sophomore      sorry i can t explain  flockley and koswell can if they wish  but i  advise them to keep a certain party s name out of the story   added  dick significantly  he felt bound to protect minnie sanderson as much  as possible      it s all stuff and nonsense   roared dudd flockley   they are  freshies and ought to be bounced off the fence and given a lesson in  the bargain       that s it  come and hammer  em   added jerry koswell      what s the row here   demanded a tall lad who had just come up  he  had light curly hair  blue eyes and a face that was sunshine itself      two freshies on the stone fence  holden   said one of the sophomores    we can t allow that  you know      at this frank holden  the leader of the sophomore class  laughed      too bad  fellows  but they ve got you  term doesn t begin until  to morrow and they can sit where they please until twelve o clock  midnight  after that   he turned to dick and sam   well  your blood  will be on your own heads if you disturb this fence or the benches  around the flagstaff       my gracious  frank s right  term isn t on until to morrow   cried  another student   i beg your pardon  boys   and he bowed lowly to the  rovers      gee  it s a wonder you fellows wouldn t say something before i was  kicked off the earth   growled the sophomore who had been sent to the  grass by sam      don t thank me for what i did   said sam pleasantly  and this caused  some of the other college fellows to grin      don t say a word   cried the one who had gone down   only  well  if i  catch you on the fence  it will be who s best man  that s all       aren t we to do anything to these freshies   demanded dudd flockley   he did not at all relish the turn affairs had taken      can t do a thing until to morrow   answered frank holden decidedly      bah  i believe in making a freshie toe the mark as soon as he  arrives       so do i   added jerry koswell      can t be done  against the traditions of brill   answered the class  leader   you ve got to give a freshman time to get his feet planted on  the ground  you know   he added kindly and with a smile at dick and  sam      thank you for that   answered the older rover   we ll be ready for  the whole sophomore class by to morrow       we ll see   answered holden and passed on  and the majority of the  second year fellows followed  flockley and koswell lingered behind      see here  you chaps   said flockley   what are your names       if you want to know so bad  my name is dick rover and this is my  brother sam       and who was the other fellow   asked koswell      my brother tom       three brothers  eh  and named rover   growled dudd flockley   all  right  i ll remember that  and i ll remember how you treated us up to  the sanderson place       and i ll remember it too and square up   added koswell      we ll make brill too hot to hold you   snapped flockley  and then he  turned into the gateway leading to the campus and his crony followed           chapter v    getting acquainted       dick  we have made two enemies  that s sure   remarked sam to his  brother as they watched flockley and koswell depart      it couldn t be helped if we have  sam   was the reply   you are not  sorry for what we did at the sanderson house  are you       not in the least  what we should have done was to give those chaps a  sound thrashing       they seem to have a number of friends here  probably they will do all  they can to make life at this college miserable for us       well  if they do too much  i reckon we can do something too      some new students had been standing at a distance watching the scene  described in the last chapter  now one of them approached and nodded  pleasantly      freshmen   he asked      yes   answered both of the rovers      so am i  my name is stanley browne  what s yours       dick rover  and this is my brother sam       oh  are you dick rover  i ve heard about you  my cousin knows you  real well       who is your cousin       larry colby       larry   cried dick   well  i guess he does know us well  we ve had  some great times together at putnam hall and elsewhere  so you are  larry s cousin  i am real glad to know you   and dick held out his  hand      larry is one of our best chums   said sam  also shaking hands   i  remember now that he has spoken of you  i am glad to know somebody at  this place   and sam smiled broadly  soon all three of the boys were  on good terms  and stanley browne told the rovers something about  himself      i come from the south   he said   my folks own a large cotton  plantation there  larry was down there once and we had a lot of fun   he told me of the sport he had had with you  you must have had great  times at putnam hall       we did   said sam      i thought there were three of you  from what larry said       so there are   answered dick  and told about tom and the missing  dress suit case   tom ought to be getting back   he added     stanley had been at brill for two days and had met both flockley and  koswell  he did not fancy either of the sophomores      that frank holden is all right   he said   but flockley and koswell  are very overbearing and dictatorial  i caught them ordering one of  the freshmen around like a servant  if they had spoken that way to me  i d have knocked them down   and the eyes of the southern lad flashed  darkly      where do you room   asked dick  he remembered what the house master  had said about stanley and felt that the youth would make a nice  roommate for anybody      i m in no      right next to you fellows  mr  hicks was going to put  me in with you first  but afterward said a friend of yours was going  to fill the place       yes   said dick   but you will be right next door  so it will be  almost the same thing  who is your roommate       a fellow named max spangler  i don t know much about him  as he only  came this noon  but he seems all right  here he comes now      as stanley spoke he motioned to a short  stout lad who was walking  across the campus  the boy had a distinctly german face and one full  of smiles      hello  friend browne   he called out pleasantly and with a german  accent   did you find somebody you know       i ve made myself known   answered stanley  and then he introduced the  others   they bunk next door to us   he added with a nod toward dick  and sam      hope you don t snore   said max spangler   i can go anybody but what  snores       no  we don t snore   answered sam  laughing      then i m your friend for life and two days afterward   answered the  german american lad  and said this so gravely the others had to laugh   max put the rovers in mind of their old friend hans mueller  but he  spoke much better english than did hans  getting his words twisted  only when he was excited     dick suggested that they all walk down the road to meet tom  and this  was done  the conversation was a lively one  stanley and max telling  of their former schooldays and the rovers relating a few of their own  adventures  thus the four got to be quite friendly by the time the  carriage with tom and mr  sanderson came in sight      find it   sang out sam to his brother      no   was tom s reply      you didn t   cried dick   how far back did you go       way back to rushville  i know it was in the carriage at that place   for i saw it       too bad   said sam   did you have much of value in it       not a great deal  most of my stuff is in my trunk  but the case alone  was worth six dollars  and it had my comb and brush and toothbrush and  all those things in it       want me any more   asked mr  sanderson   if you don t  i ll get home   it s past milking time now       no  i ll not need you   answered tom and hopped to the ground  a  minute later the farmer turned his team around and was gone in a cloud  of dust     tom was introduced to stanley and max  and the whole crowd walked  slowly back to the college grounds  then tom was taken to his room   the others going up stairs with him  he washed and brushed up  went to  the office and registered  and then the bell rang for supper     the dining hall at brill was a more elaborate affair than the messroom  at putnam hall  but the rovers were used to dining out in fine places   so they felt perfectly at home  dick and sam had already met the  instructor who had charge of their table  mr  timothy blackie  and  they introduced tom  stanley and max were at the same table and also a  long haired youth named will jackson  although his friends called him   spud       i don t know why they call me spud   he said to dick   excepting  because i like potatoes so  i d rather eat them than any other  vegetable  why  when i was out in jersey one summer  on a farm  i ate  potatoes morning  noon and night and sometimes between times  the  farmer said i had better look out or i d sprout  i guess i ate about   steen bushels in three weeks       phew   whistled sam   that s a good one       oh  it s a fact   went on spud   why  one night i got up in my sleep  and they found me down in the potato bin  filling my coat pockets with  potatoes  and        filling your coat pocket   queried stanley   do you sleep with your  coat on       why  i  er  i guess i did that night   answered will jackson in some  confusion   anyway  i m a great potato eater   he added lightly  later  on the others found out that spud had a vivid imagination and did not  hesitate to  draw the long bow  for the sake of telling a good story     the meal was rather a stiff and quiet one among the new students  but  the old scholars made the room hum with talk about what had happened  at the previous term  there was a good bit of conversation concerning  the last season of baseball and more about the coming work on the  gridiron  from the talk the rovers gathered that brill belonged to  something of a league composed of several colleges situated in that  territory  and that they had held the football championship four and  three seasons before  but had lost it to one of the colleges the next  season and to another college the season just past      football hits me   said dick to stanley   i d like to play  first rate       maybe you ll get a chance on the eleven  although i suppose they give  the older students the preference   was the reply     stanley had met quite a few of the other students  and after supper  he introduced the rovers and max and also spud  thus the rovers were  speedily put on friendly terms with a score or more of the freshmen  and also several of the others  one of the seniors  a refined young  man named allan charter  took the crowd through the library and the  laboratory and also down to the gymnasium and the boathouse      we haven t any boat races  for we have no other college to race  against   said the senior   the students sometimes get up contests  between themselves  though  dick dawson used to be our best oarsman   but last june a fellow named jerry koswell beat him       koswell   cried sam   i thought he was too much of a dude to row in a  race      at this remark the senior smiled faintly      evidently you have met mr  koswell   he remarked pointedly      we have   answered tom      well  he can row  if he can t do anything else       i d like to try my skill against him some day   said tom  who during  the past year had taken quite a fancy to rowing      perhaps koswell will be glad to let you have the chance   said allan  charter     a little later the senior left the freshmen  and the latter strolled  back in the direction of the college buildings  it was now growing  dark  and the rovers concluded to go up to their rooms and unpack  their trunks  which had just come in from the depot      you fellows want to keep your eyes wide open to night   cautioned  stanley  who came up with them      hazing   asked dick      so i was told       will they start in so early   asked sam      any time after midnight  i hate to think of it  but i reckon a fellow  has got to submit       that depends   answered dick   i ll not stand for everything  i ll  not mind a little hazing  but it mustn t be carried too far       that s the talk   cried tom   if they go too far  well  we ll try to  give  em as good as they send  that s all       right you are   came from sam     they unpacked their trunks and proceeded to make themselves at home as  much as possible  as dick was alone in his room  he went over to his  brothers  apartment for company  locking his door as he did so      i ll tell you what i d do if i were you  dick   said tom   stay here  to night  my bed is big enough for two on a pinch  then  if there is  any hazing  we can keep together  to morrow  if songbird comes  it  will be different      this suited the oldest rover  and he brought over such things as he  needed for the night  the boys were tired out  having put in a busy  day  and by ten o clock sam and tom were both yawning      i think i ll go to bed   said sam   if anything happens wake me up       oh  you ll wake up fast enough if they come   answered tom   but i am  going to lay down myself  but i am not going to undress yet      taking off their shoes and collars  ties and coats  the boys said  their prayers and laid down  sam was soon in the land of dreams  and  presently tom and dick followed     two hours passed and the three lads were sleeping soundly  when  suddenly tom awoke with a yell  a stream of cold water had struck him  in the head  making him imagine for the instant that he was being  drowned      hi  stop  he spluttered and then stopped  for the stream of water  took him directly in the mouth  then the stream was shifted and struck  first dick and then sam  all three of the rovers leaped from the beds  as quickly as possible  although confused from being awakened so  rudely  they realized what it meant     they were being hazed           chapter vi    a hazing  and what followed      the stream of water came from a small hose that was being played  through a transom window over the door of the room  a lad was holding  the hose  and in the dim light dick recognized the face of a youth  named bart larkspur  a sophomore who did not bear a very good  reputation  larkspur was poor and dick had heard that he was used by  flockley  koswell and others to do all sorts of odd jobs  for which  the richer lads paid him well      stop that  you   cried the oldest rover  and then  rushing to the  door  he flung it open and gave a shove to what was beyond  this was  a short step ladder upon which larkspur and several others were  standing  and over the ladder went with a crash  sending the hazers to  the floor of the hallway in a heap      get the hose   whispered tom  who had followed his brother  and while  the sophomores were endeavoring to get up  he caught the squirming  hose and wrenched it  nozzle and all  from bart larkspur s hand      hi  give me that   yelled larkspur      all right  here you are   answered tom merrily  and turned the stream  of water directly in the sophomore s face  larkspur spluttered and  shied and then plunged to one side into a fellow student standing  near  this was dudd flockley  and he was carried down on his back      play away  six   called out tom in true fireman style  and directed  the stream on flockley  it hit the dudish student in the chin and ran  down inside his shirt collar      stop  i beg of you  oh  my   screamed flockley  trying to dodge the  water   larkspur  grab the hose  knock that rascal down  why don t  somebody do something       give me that hose  you freshie   called out jerry koswell  who was  in the crowd   don t you know better than to resist your superiors  i  want you to understand        keep cool  old man  don t get excited   answered tom brazenly   ah  i  see you are too warm  will that serve to keep your temperature down    and now he turned the hose on koswell  hitting the fellow directly in  the left ear  koswell let out a wild yell and started to retreat and  so did several others      don t go  capture the hose   called out flockley  but even as he  spoke he took good care to get behind another sophomore      capture it yourself   growled the youth he was using as a shield      say  you re making too much noise   whispered another student   do  you want the proctor down on us  and turn that water off before you  ruin the building  somebody has got to pay for this  remember   he  added     as it was an unwritten law of brill that all hazers must pay for any  damage done to college property while hazing anybody  one of the  sophomores started for the lavatory where the hose had been attached  to a water faucet  but while the water still ran  tom  aided by dick  and sam  directed the stream on the sophomores  who were forced to  retreat down the hallway      now rush  em  rush  em   yelled flockley  when the water had ceased  to run   bind and gag  em  and take  em down to the gym  we can finish  hazing  em there       get into the room   whispered dick   hurry up  and barricade the  door       right you are  but no more hose water for me   answered tom  and  pulled on the rubber with all his might  it parted about half way down  the hallway  and into the room he darted with the piece in his hands   then sam and dick closed the door  locked it  and shoved a bed and the  table against the barrier  they also turned the button of the transom  window so that the glass could not be swung back as before      now they can t get in unless they break in   said dick grimly   and i  doubt if they ll dare to do that       say  maybe i m not wet   remarked sam  surveying his dripping shirt      never mind  we sent as good as we got  and more   answered tom with  a grin   let us put on our coats so we don t catch cold  no use of  putting on dry clothing until you are sure the ball is over       tom  you re a crack fireman   said dick with a smile   i ll wager  those sophs are mad enough to chew nails       what s sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander   quoted the  fun loving rover   what s the good of living if you can t return a  compliment now and then      for several minutes all was silent outside  then came a light knock  on the door  dick held his hand up for silence and the knock was  repeated      don t answer them   whispered the oldest rover      say  i want to talk to you fellows   came in low tones   this is  important       who are you   asked dick after a pause      i m larkspur  bart larkspur  i want to tell you something       well  what is it   demanded tom      your resistance to our class won t do you any good  if you ll come  out and take your medicine like men  all right  but if you resist it  will go that much harder with you       who sent you  frank holden   asked sam      what has holden to do with it   growled larkspur      we know he s the leader of your class       he is not  dudd flockley is our leader       then flockley sent you  eh   put in dick      yes  if you want to know it       well  tell flockley to mind his own business   answered dick sharply    if frank holden wants us we ll come  but not otherwise       are you hazing any of the other fellows   asked tom      we ll haze them after we get through with you   growled larkspur  and  then the rovers heard him tiptoe his way down the hall      i think this attack was gotten up by the flockley koswell crowd    was dick s comment   maybe it wasn t sanctioned by the other sophs at  all      the rovers waited a while longer and then with caution they pulled  back the bed and the table and opened the door  by the dim light in  the hallway they saw that the place was deserted  somebody had run a  mop over the polished floor  thus taking up most of the water      i guess they have given it up for to night   said dick  and his words  proved correct     after waiting a good hour the three rovers rearranged the room   hanging up some of the bedding and rugs to dry near the window  which  they left wide open  then they locked the door and went into dick s  room  which had not been disturbed  as they did this another door  opened  and stanley poked out his head  followed by max      we heard it all   said the southern lad with a chuckle   hope you  doused  em good       we did   answered tom   they didn t tackle you  did they       no  but i suppose they will later  or to morrow       i am ready for them if they come   came from max   i got this   and  he held up a long  white sack      what is it   asked sam      plaster of paris  if they tackle me i ll make  em look like marble  statues already   and the german american youth winked one eye  suggestively     despite the excitement the rover boys slept soundly for the rest of  the night  all were rather sleepy in the morning  but a good wash in  cold water brightened them greatly  while getting ready for breakfast  they looked for flockley and koswell  but those two students  as well  as larkspur  kept out of sight      they don t like the way matters turned out last night   said dick     on entering the dining room they saw the sophomores at a nearby table   flockley and koswell glared darkly  while as they passed  larkspur  put out his foot to trip sam up  but sam was on guard  and instead  of stumbling he stepped on the fellow s ankle  something that caused  larkspur to utter a gasp of pain      what did you do that for   he demanded savagely      sorry  but you shouldn t sprawl all over with your feet   answered  the youngest rover coldly  and passed on to his seat  when he looked  back  larkspur  watching his chance so that no teacher might see him   shook his fist at sam      we have got to keep our eyes wide open for that bunch   was dick s  comment   last night s affair will make flockley and koswell more sour  than ever  and larkspur is evidently their tool  and willing to do  anything they wish done      after chapel the rovers were assigned to their various classes and  given their text books  it was announced that no regular classes would  be called until the following monday morning      that gives us plenty of time to study our first lessons   said sam      yes  and gives us time to get acquainted with the college layout and  the rest of the students   added tom   do you know  i think i am going  to like it bang up here       just what i was thinking   returned dick   it isn t quite so boyish  as putnam hall was  some of the seniors are young men  but that  doesn t matter  we are growing older ourselves       gracious  i m not old   cried tom   why  i feel like a two year old  colt   and to prove his words he did several steps of a jig     only about half of the students had as yet arrived  the others being  expected that day  friday  and saturday  the college coach was to  bring in some of the boys about eleven o clock  and the rovers  wondered if songbird powell would be among them      you ll like songbird   said dick to stanley browne   he s a great  chap for manufacturing what he calls poetry  but he isn t one of the  dreamy kind  he s as bright and chipper as you find  em      the boys walked down to the gymnasium  and there sam and tom took a  few turns on the bars and tried the wooden horses  while they did  this dick talked to a number of the freshmen with whom he had become  acquainted      we are to have a necktie rush monday   said one boy   every fellow is  to wear the college colors  meet on the campus an hour before supper  time       i ll be there   said dick  he knew what was meant by a necktie rush   all the freshmen would don neckties showing the college colors  and  the sophomores  and perhaps the juniors  would do their best to get  the neckties away from them  if more than half the boys lost their  ties before the supper bell rang the freshmen would be debarred from  wearing the colors for that term     shortly before eleven o clock a shout was heard on the road  and a  number of the students made a rush in that direction  the college  coach swung into sight in a cloud of dust  it was fairly overflowing  with boys and young men  all yelling and singing and waving their hats  and caps  at the sight those on the campus set up a cheer      this is something like   cried tom enthusiastically  he wanted to see  things  warm up   as he expressed it     the coach was followed by three carriages  and all deposited their  loads at the main building steps and on the campus  there were more  cheers and many handshakes      there he is   cried sam  and rushing forward  he caught john powell  by the hand  shook it  and relieved the newcomer of his suit case      hello  sam   cried songbird  and grinned from ear to ear   hello   dick  hello  tom  say  did i surprise you   and now he shook hands  with the others      you sure did   replied dick   i was afraid i was going to have a  stranger for a roommate  your coming here suits me to a t       i didn t write to you because i wanted to surprise you   explained  songbird   i ve composed some verses about it  they start        never mind the verses now   interrupted tom   come on in and we ll  introduce you to the fellows  and then we ll listen to your story  and  we ll tell you some things that will surprise you       and i ll tell you some things that will surprise you  too   returned  john powell  as he was led away by the three rover boys           chapter vii    the arrival of songbird       so you ve made some enemies as well as some friends  eh   remarked  songbird powell  after he had been registered  taken up to his room   and had listened to what the rover boys had to tell   no use of  talking  it doesn t take you fellows long to stir things up       you said you had a surprise for us  songbird   returned tom   i m  dying by inches to know what it is       maybe it s a new poem   put in sam with a grimace at his brothers      i ve got a poem  several of them  in fact   answered songbird   but  i didn t have those in mind when i spoke  who do you suppose i met  yesterday morning  in ithaca  while i was waiting for the train       dora stanhope and the lanings   answered tom promptly      no  tad sobber       tad sobber   exclaimed the rover boys in concert      songbird  are you sure of it   demanded dick      sure  wasn t i talking to him       but  but  i thought he was lost in that hurricane  when the   josephine  was wrecked       no  it seems he escaped to a vessel bound for england  but his uncle   sid merrick  was lost  and so were most of the others  sobber just got  back from england  came in on one of the ocean liners  so he told me       how did he act   asked tom      where was he going   added sam      did he seem to have any money   came from dick     all of the rovers were intensely interested  and showed it plainly      say  one question at a time  please   cried songbird   you put me in  mind of a song i once wrote about a little boy         a little lad named johnny spark    was nothing but a question mark     he asked his questions night and day     when he was resting or at play     one minute he would tackle pa     and then he d turn and tackle ma     and then his uncle he would quiz          and let that line please end the biz      finished tom   say  songbird  please don t quote poetry when we are  waiting to hear all about tad sobber  have some pity on us       yes  tell us of sobber   added sam and dick      all right  if you don t appreciate my verses   returned the would be  poet with a sigh   well  to start with  tad sobber was well dressed   and looked as if he had all the money he needed  he wore a brown  checkered suit  so evidently he hasn t gone into mourning for his  uncle  he told me he had had a rough experience on the ocean during  the hurricane  and he blames you rovers for all his troubles       that s just like sobber   was dick s comment      he wouldn t tell me where he was going or what he was going to do   but he did let drop a remark or two about the fortune you discovered  on treasure isle  he said that he was firmly convinced that the money  belonged to him and to his uncle s estate  and that he meant some day  to make a fight for it       in the courts   asked tom   if he does that he ll get beaten  father  says the treasure belongs to the stanhope estate and to nobody else       no  he didn t say he was going to court about it  but he said he was  bound to get hold of it some day       i hope he doesn t try to get it by force   said sam   that would mean  trouble for the stanhopes and the lanings       the money is in the banks now  sam   said dick   he couldn t get hold  of it excepting on an order from those to whom it belongs       and they ll never give him any such order   added tom      do you suppose he was going to see the stanhopes and the lanings    questioned the oldest rover anxiously      he didn t say  i wanted to question him further  but a man who was  standing on a corner  some distance away  beckoned to him  and he left  me and joined the man  and the two walked off       who was the man       i don t know      the boys talked the matter over for some time  but songbird had  nothing more to tell  and at last the subject was dropped  songbird  was introduced to stanley  max  and a number of the other students   and soon he felt quite at home     that evening there was a bit of hazing  dick and tom escaped  but sam   songbird and stanley were caught in the lower hallway by a number of  the sophomores and carried bodily to the gymnasium  here they were  tossed in blankets and then blindfolded      we ll take them to the river   said one of the sophomores   a bath  will do them good       let s give  em a rubbing down with mud   cried jerry koswell  he had  some tar handy  and if the mud was used he intended to mix some of the  tar with it on the sly      that s the talk   cried larkspur  who knew about the tar  he having  purchased it for koswell and flockley  the three had at first intended  to smear the beds of the rovers with it  but had gotten no chance      give them a good dose   said dudd flockley  he had joined in the  blanket tossing with vigor     sam  songbird and stanley were being led to the river when max came  rushing up to tom and dick  who happened to be in the library  looking  over some works of travel      come on mit you   he cried excitedly in broken english   da have got  sam and stanley and dot friend of yours alretty  hurry up  or da was  killed before we git to help  em       they  who   asked dick  leaping up      sophs  down by der gym   and then max cooled down a bit and related  what he had seen      we must surely go to the rescue   cried tom   wait  i ll get clubs  for all hands   and he rushed up to his room  where in a clothing  closet lay the end of the hose he had taken away from the sophomores   with his knife he cut the section of hose into eight  clubs   and with  these in his hands he hurried below again     at a cry from dick and max the freshmen commenced to gather on the  campus  and tom quickly handed around the sections of hose  other  first year lads procured sticks  boxing gloves  and other things  and  looked around for somebody to lead them      come on   cried dick  and he sprang to the front  with tom on one  side and max on the other  the german american boy had a big squirtgun  filled with water  a gun used by the gardener for spraying the bushes     the sophomores had captured four more freshmen  and marched all of  the crowd down to the river front  when the band under dick  sixteen  strong  appeared  the latter came on yelling like indians  and  flourishing their sections of hose  and sticks and other things      let  em go  let  em go   was the rallying cry  and then whack  whack   whack  down came the rubber clubs and the sticks on the backs of the  second year students      fight  em off   came from the sophomores      chase  em away   yelled dudd flockley  but hardly had he spoken when  max discharged the squirtgun  and the water took flockley in the eye   causing him to yell with fright and retreat  then max turned the gun  on larkspur  soaking the latter pretty thoroughly     attacked from the rear  the sophomores had to let go their holds on  their victims  and as soon as they were released sam  songbird and the  others ran to the right and the left and joined the force under dick     all told  the freshmen now numbered twenty three  while the sophomores  could count up but fourteen  the second year students were hemmed in  and gradually forced nearer and nearer to the bank of the river      let up  let up   yelled several in alarm   don t knock us overboard       it s nothing but mud here  i don t want my new suit spoiled   cried  one      i can t swim   added another      i ve got an idea   whispered tom to the others near him   shove  em  in the mud and water  or else make  em promise not to take part in the  necktie rush       that s the talk   replied dick  he caught hold of the sophomore in  front of him   all shove  fellows   and the second year students were  gradually forced to the very edge of the river at a point where there  was a little water and a good deal of dark  sticky mud  of course  they fought desperately to push the freshmen back  but they were  outnumbered  as already told      now  then  every fellow who will promise not to take part in the  necktie rush monday will be allowed to go free   said dick loudly    the others must take their ducking in the water  and mud       let me go   roared dudd flockley   i m not going to have this suit  ruined       i don t want to get these patent leathers wet   cried jerry koswell   who had on a new pair of shiny shoes      then promise   cried sam  and  promise    promise   came from many  others     without delay several of the sophomores promised  and they were  allowed to depart  then the others began to show fight  and three  managed to escape  among them being dudd flockley  the others were  forced into the water and mud up to their knees  then they cried out  in alarm  and while two finally escaped  the others also promised to  keep out of the necktie contest      just wait   snarled jerry koswell as he at last managed to pull  himself out of the sticky mud   just wait  that s all   his  patent leather shoes were a sight to behold      not so much fun when you are hazed yourself  is it   asked sam  coolly      we ll give it to  em yet   put in bart larkspur   lots of time  between now and the closing of the term   and then he and koswell ran  off to join dudd flockley  the three went to their rooms and cleaned  up as best they could  and then took a walk down the road in the  direction of rushville      it was that dick rover who led the attack   said dudd flockley   do  you know what i think  i think he is going to try to make himself  leader of the freshies       just what i thought  too   answered larkspur   and if that s the fact  we ought to do all we can to pull him down       tom rover is the fellow i am going to get after   came from jerry  koswell  he had not forgotten how tom and sam had sent him to the  floor in the presence of minnie sanderson     the three students walked a distance of half a mile when they saw  approaching them a trampish looking man carrying what looked to be a  new dress suit case  they looked at the fellow rather sharply and he  halted as he came up to them      excuse me   he mumbled   but did any of you gents lose this case       why  it must be rover s case   cried flockley  nearly every one in  the college had heard about the missing baggage      i found it in the bushes alongside the road   went on the tramp    thought it might belong to some of the college gents       let me look at it   said koswell  and turned the case around   yes   it s rover s   he added  seeing the initials and the address      better take it up to the college   put in larkspur      wait  i ll take it up   said jerry koswell suddenly   this belongs to  a poor chap   he added to the tramp   he won t be able to reward you   but i will  here s a quarter for you   and he passed over the silver  piece      much obliged   said the tramp   want me to carry it up to the  buildings       no  i ll do that   said koswell  and then he winked at his cronies   the tramp went on and the three watched him disappear in the distance      what did you do that for  jerry   asked flockley with interest  he  surmised that something new was afoot      oh  i did it for the fun of the thing   answered koswell coolly   but  maybe i can work it in somehow against that rover bunch  anyway  i ll  try            chapter viii    the colors contest      the next morning tom was much surprised to find his missing dress suit  case standing in front of his room door      hello  how did this get here   he cried as he picked up the baggage      what s that   asked sam  who was just getting up      look   answered his brother  and brought the case in   somebody must  have found it and left it here while i was asleep       very kind  whoever he was   said sam   are the contents all right      instead of answering tom placed the suit case on a chair and started  to unlock it      hello  it s unlocked   he murmured   i thought i had it locked      he shoved back the clasps and threw the case open  the contents were  much jumbled  but he had expected this from the fact that the bag had  been jounced out of the carriage      i guess the stuff is all here   he said slowly  turning over the  clothing and other things   somehow  i thought i had more in the case   though   he added presently      don t you know what you had       well  er  i packed it in a hurry  you know  i wanted to go fishing   and so i got through as soon as i could  oh  i guess it s all right      tom was too lively a youth to pay much attention to his personal  belongings  often he hardly knew what suit of clothing he had on or  what sort of a necktie  the only times he really fixed up was when  nellie laning was near  why he did that only himself  and possibly  nellie  knew     sunday passed quietly  some of the boys attended one or another of the  churches in ashton  and the rovers went with them  dudd flockley and  his cronies took a walk up the river  and reaching a warm  sunny spot   threw themselves down to smoke cigarettes and talk      well  what did you do about the dress suit case  jerry   asked  flockley with a sharp look at his crony      returned it  as you know   was the answer  and jerry winked  suggestively      i d have flung the bag in the river before i would give it to such a  chap as tom rover   growled larkspur      you trust me  larky  old boy   answered jerry koswell   i know what  i m doing       humph       i said i returned the case  but i didn t say i returned all that was  in it       what do you mean by that   demanded flockley   if you ve got a  secret  out with it      koswell looked around to make certain that no outsider was near      i kept a few things out of the bag  some things that had tom rover s  name or his initials on them       and you are going to    went on flockley      i am going to use  em some day  when i get the chance       good   cried flockley   i ll help you  jerry       and so will i   added larkspur   if we work it right we can get tom  rover in a peck of trouble      on monday morning the college term opened in earnest  and once again  the rovers had to get down to the  grind   as sam expressed it  but  the boys had had a long vacation and were in the best of health  and  they did not mind the studying      got to have a good education if you want to get along nowadays   was  the way dick expressed himself   if you don t learn you are bound  to be at the mercy of anybody who wants to take advantage of your  ignorance       dick  what are you going to do when you get out of college   asked  tom      i don t know  go into business  i imagine       oh  he ll marry and settle down   chimed in sam   he and dora will  live in an ivy covered cottage like two turtle doves  and       sam got no further  for a pillow thrown by dick caught him full in the  face and made him stagger      sam is thinking of what he and grace are going to do   said dick    and you and nellie will likely have a cottage across the way   he  added  grinning at tom      really   murmured tom  and got as red as a beet   say  call it off    he added   do you know we have the necktie rush this afternoon       it won t amount to much   answered sam   too many sophs out of it       don t you believe it   said dick   remember  the juniors come into  this as well as the sophs       say  i ve thought of a plan   cried tom   greatest ever  i m going to  patent it   and he commenced to dance around in his excitement      what s loose   asked songbird  coming up at that moment  followed by  some others   tom  have you got a pain in your inwards       no  an idea  it s about the same thing   responded tom gaily   we  want to get the best of the second and third year fellows during the  necktie rush  and i think i know how we can do it  we ll all sew our  neckties fast      for a moment there was silence  and then  as the others caught the  idea  they commenced to laugh      that s it   cried sam   i ll sew mine as tight as a drum       i ll rivet mine on  if that will do any good   added dick      sure thing   came from songbird  and he commenced to recite        oh  the sophs and the juniors will try    to steal from the freshies each tie         but they will not win         for we ll fight them like sin          and bust  em right plumb in the eye    finished tom   oh  say  but will you all sew your neckties fast       sure       and we ll tell the rest to do so  too   added another freshman who  was present     the news soon circulated  and was kept from all but the first year  students     it must be confessed that many of the students found it hard to fix  their minds on their lessons that afternoon  one boy  max spangler   brought on a great laugh when the following question was put to him      what great improvement in navigation did fulton introduce       neckties   answered max abstractedly      neckties   queried the instructor in astonishment      i  er  i don t mean neckties   stammered the german american student    i mean steamboats      when the afternoon session was over the students hurried to their  various rooms  the sophomores and the juniors who were to take part  in the contest talked matters over  and as far as possible laid out a  plan of action  it was decided that the largest and heaviest of the  second and third year students were to tackle the smallest freshmen  first  while the others were to hold the rest of the first year men at  bay      we ll get fifteen or twenty neckties first clip that way   said one  of the sophomores   and it doesn t matter who we get them from  a  little chap s tie counts as much as that of a two hundred pounder      in the meantime the freshmen were busy following tom s advice and  sewing their ties fast to their collars  shirts  and even their  undershirts  then dick  who had  unconsciously almost  become a  leader  called the boys into an empty recitation room      now  i ve got a plan   said he   we want to bunch up  and all the  little fellows and lightweights get in the center  the heavy fellows  can take the outside and fight the others off  understand       yes       that s a good idea       forward to the fray   yelled stanley   and woe be to him who tries to  get my tie  his blood be on his own head   he added tragically      forward   cried sam   and let our watchword be   die  but no tie        now don t get excited   said dick   take it coolly  and i m certain  that when the time is up we ll have the most of our ties still on      it was the custom to go out on the campus at a given time  and when  the chapel bell sounded out the hour dick led the freshmen forward   they came out of a side door in a body and formed around the flagstaff  almost before the sophomores and juniors knew they had appeared     the seniors took no part  but three had been  told off  to act as  referees  and they stood around as if inspecting the buildings and the  scenery  the instructors  who also knew what was coming  wisely kept  out of sight      come on  and at  em   called out dudd flockley  and this cry was  quickly taken up by all the others who were to take part in the  contest      hello  they know a thing or two   said frank holden  who was the  sophomore leader in the attack   they ve got the little fellows in the  middle      as tightly as possible the freshmen gathered around the flagstaff   each wore a necktie of the college colors and it was fastened as  tightly as strong thread could hold it      at  em   was the yell of the second and third year lads   tear  em  apart  pull the ties from  em      and then they leaped in at the big freshmen  and on the instant a  battle royal was started  down went four boys on the campus  rolling  over and over  others caught each other by the hands and shoulders and  wrestled valiantly     dick and tom were in the front rank  with sam directly behind them   dick was caught by frank holden  and the two wrestled with might and  main  frank was big and strong  but dick managed to hold him so that  all the sophomore leader could do was to get his finger tips on the  sought for necktie     flockley tackled tom  and much to his surprise was tripped up and sent  flat on his back  mad with sudden rage  flockley scrambled up and let  out a savage kick for tom s stomach  but tom was too quick for the  sophomore  and leaped to one side      foul   cried tom      don t do that again   called one of the seniors to dudd   if you do  you ll be ruled out   kicking and punching were prohibited by the  rules  all the boys could do was to wrestle and throw each other  and  either try to pull the neckties away or hold on to them     on and on the battle waged  each minute growing hotter  many of the  students were almost winded  and felt that they could not endure  the struggle much longer  dick  tom and sam managed to keep their  neckties  although sam s was torn loose by two sophomores who held him  as in a vise until stanley came to his assistance  when the time was  half up eleven neckties had been captured  two of them almost torn to  shreds      at  em   yelled frank holden   we haven t begun yet       hold  em back   was dick s rallying answer   don t let  em get near  the little fellows      again the contest raged  and this time with increased bitterness  in  the melee some few blows were exchanged  but it must be admitted that  one side was about as much to blame for this as the other  three  additional neckties were captured  making fourteen in all  as  thirty seven freshmen were in the contest  the sophomores and juniors  had to capture five more neckties to win      only three minutes more   sang out one student  looking at his watch    at  em  rip  em apart       three minutes more   yelled dick   hold  em back and we ll win      the enemy fought with increased fury  and one more necktie was  taken  the collar and collar band coming with it  but then of a sudden  the chapel bell tolled out the hour      time s up   was the cry      and we win   came from a score of freshmen in huge delight      look out  look out   cried several small youths in the center of the  crowd     crack  it was the flagstaff  and all looked in that direction  the  pole  old and decayed  was falling  it looked as if it would crush all  who stood in its path           chapter ix        tom in trouble       look out  the flagpole is coming down       stand from under  or you ll be killed      crack  came from the pole  and now many saw that it was breaking off  close to the ground  some of the students had clung to it during the  contest  and the strain had been too much for the stick  which was  much rotted just where it entered the ground     those on the outside of the crowd ran away with ease  but not so those  who were hemmed in  two of the smallest of the freshmen  billy dean  and charley atwood  could not move fast enough  and one fell over the  other  and both went down      save me   gasped one of the lads      don t let the pole come down on me   screamed the other     the flagstaff was falling swiftly  and dick and many others saw that  it would fall directly across dean and atwood unless its progress was  stayed      hold it up  hold it up   yelled dick   hold it up  or they ll be  killed      he put up his hands to meet the pole  which was coming down across  the front of the campus  tom did likewise  and so did frank holden   stanley brown  and several others  including an extra tall and  powerful senior     it was a heavy weight  and for the moment the boys under it thought  they would have to let it go  over came the pole  and when it rested  on the boys  hands the top overbalanced the bottom and struck the  ground  sending the lower end into the air  as this happened billy  dean and charley atwood were hauled out of harm s way  then the pole  was dropped to the campus with a thud     for several seconds all who stood near were too dazed to speak  then  a cheer arose for those who had held the flagstaff up long enough for  the small youths to be rescued      say  that was a close shave   exclaimed sam  he  like a good many  others  was quite pale      it was indeed   said a senior who had come up   the fellows who held  the pole up deserve a good deal of credit       dick rover suggested it   said songbird   good for you  dick   he  added warmly     the falling of the flagstaff sobered the whole party of students  yet  the freshmen were jubilant over the fact that they had won in the  colors contest      and we ll wear the colors this term   cried tom proudly      so we will   called out others in a chorus   we ll wear  em good and  strong  too   and they did  the very next day some of the lads came  out with neckties twice the ordinary size  and with hat bands several  inches wide  all  of course  in the brill colors     billy dean and charley atwood were much affected by what had occurred   and quickly retired from the scene  but later both of the small  students thanked dick and the others for what had been done for them   the broken flagstaff was hauled away by the laborers of the place  and  inside of a week a new pole  much larger than the old one  and set in  concrete  was put up     for several days after the contest over the colors matters ran along  smoothly at brill  the rover boys made many more friends  and because  of his work during the necktie rush dick was chosen as the leader of  the freshmen s class      on friday i am going to fix tom rover   said jerry koswell to dudd  flockley   just wait and see what i do  and keep your mouth shut       i ll keep my mouth shut right enough   answered dudd   but what s in  the wind       i m going to pay off professor sharp for some of his meanness  and  pay off tom rover at the same time       give me a map of the proceedings  i m too tired to guess riddles   jerry       well  you know how sharp called me down to day in english       sure       well  i ve learned that he just received a new photograph of some  lady  i think his best girl  he has it on the mantle in his room  i m  going to doctor that picture  and i m going to lay the blame on tom  rover       how will you do it       by using something i got out of rover s dress suit case       oh  i see       sharp will suspect rover at once  because he and rover had a few  words yesterday       good  i hope he catches it well  rover  i mean   answered dudd  flockley     saturday was more or less of a holiday at brill  and the three rover  boys planned to go to town  incidentally  they wished to learn if dora  stanhope and the laning girls had as yet arrived at hope seminary   they had received no letters from the girls since coming to brill  and  were growing anxious     tom was dressing to go to town when there came a knock on his door   and one of the proctors presented himself      thomas rover  you are wanted at the office immediately   said the  man      what for   asked tom      don t ask me  ask professor sharp   answered the proctor  and looked  at tom keenly     wondering what could be the matter  tom finished dressing  and in a  few minutes presented himself at the office  president wallington and  professor sharp were both waiting for him      so you ve come at last  have you  you young rascal   cried abner  sharp angrily   how dare you do such an outrageous thing       gently  professor   remonstrated the president of brill   you are not  yet certain        oh  he did it  i am sure of it   spluttered professor sharp   i  declare i ought to have him locked up       did what   demanded tom  who was much mystified by what was going on      you know well enough  you young reprobate   stormed the instructor      see here  professor sharp  i m neither a rascal nor a reprobate  and  i don t want you to call me such   cried tom  growing angry himself      you are  and i will have you to understand        i am not  and if you call me bad names again i ll  i ll  knock you  down   and tom doubled up his fists as he spoke      rover  be quiet   exclaimed doctor wallington  so sternly that both  tom and professor sharp subsided   i ll have no scene in this office   you must behave yourself like a gentleman while you are here   professor  you must not call a student hard names       but this outrage  sir   spluttered the instructor      we ll soon know the truth of the matter       i d like to know what you are talking about   said tom   i haven t  committed any outrage  so far as i know       didn t you do this   cried abner sharp  and thrust under tom s nose  a photograph of large size  the picture had once represented a fairly  good looking female of perhaps thirty years of age  but now the hair  was colored a fiery red  and the end of the nose was of the same hue  while in one corner of the dainty mouth was represented a big cigar   with the smoke curling upward  under the photograph was scrawled in  blue crayon   ain t she my darling       the representation struck tom as so comical that he was compelled to  laugh outright  he simply couldn t help it  it was just such a joke  as he might have played years before  perhaps on old josiah crabtree   when at putnam hall      ha  so you are even willing to laugh in my face  are you   almost  screamed abner sharp  and rushing at tom he caught the youth and shook  him roughly   do you  er  know that this lady is my  my affianced  wife       let me go   cried tom  and shook himself loose   excuse me  sir  i  know i hadn t ought to laugh  but it looks so  so awfully funny   and  tom had to grin again      rover   broke in the president of brill sternly   aren t you ashamed  to do such a thing as this       why  er  what do you mean  sir       just what i said       oh   a light began to break in on the fun loving rover s mind   do  you think i did this       didn t you       of course he did   fumed professor sharp   and now he is willing to  laugh over his dastardly work       i didn t do it  sir   said tom firmly      you are certain   it was the head of the college who asked the  question      yes  sir  i never saw that picture before       but i have the proof against you   fairly shouted abner sharp   it is  useless for you to deny your guilt       i say i am not guilty       isn t this your box  rover      as professor sharp uttered these words he brought to light a german  silver case which tom had picked up in a curiosity shop in new york   the case had his name engraved on it  and contained pencils  crayons   and other things for drawing      where did you get that   demanded the youth      never mind where i got it  isn t it yours       yes       ha  do you hear that  doctor wallington   cried abner sharp in  triumph   he admits the outfit is his       so i see   said the president of brill  and if anything his face  grew a trifle more stern   then you admit your guilt  rover   he  questioned      what  that i defaced the photograph       yes       no  sir  didn t i say i had never seen the picture before       this photograph was in professor sharp s room  on the mantel  the  room was locked up  and the professor carried the key  this box was  found on the table  beside some books  you had some difficulty with  the professor a day or two ago in the classroom       i didn t touch the picture  and i haven t been near professor sharp s  room   answered tom stoutly   if i was there  would i be fool enough  to leave that box behind  with my name engraved on it  and if the door  was locked how would i get in       did you lend the box to anybody       no  the fact is  i  er  i thought i had left the box home  i  oh       well       i think maybe the box was in my dress suit case  the case i lost  but  it wasn t in the case when it was left at my door that morning       oh  nonsense   muttered professor sharp   he is guilty  sir  and he  might as well own up to it first as last       i have told the strict truth   cried tom hotly   i am not in the  habit of telling falsehoods       have you any other proof against rover  professor sharp       not now  but i may be able to pick up more later       hum  this is certainly a serious matter  rover  you will go to your  room and remain there until i send for you again       can t i go down to town   asked tom      not for the present  i intend to get to the bottom of this affair   if i possibly can  if you are innocent you shall not suffer  but at  present it looks to me as if you were guilty  you may go       but  sir        not another word at present  i have other matters to attend to  i  shall call on you later  but remain in your room until i send somebody  for you      an angry answer arose to tom s lips  but he checked it  in the college  doctor wellington s word was law  and he knew he would only make  matters worse by attempting to argue  with a heavy heart he turned   gazed coldly at professor sharp  and left the office           chapter x    songbird makes a discovery       it s all up with me   said tom to his brothers when he met them in  the hall   i can t go to town       why not   asked sam      got to remain in my room until doctor wallington sends for me       what have you been doing  tom   came from dick      nothing   and then tom told of what had occurred in the office  his  brothers listened with much interest      this is the work of some enemy   said sam quickly      and the one who got hold of the dress suit case   added dick   tom   do you suspect any one       only in a general way  koswell  flockley  larkspur  and that crowd       it s too bad       say  but that picture was a sight   cried the fun loving rover  and  gunned broadly   no wonder old sharp was mad  i d be mad myself   especially if it was a photo of my best girl       i hope the doctor doesn t keep you in the room all day   said sam      you and dick might as well go to town without me   returned tom with  a sigh that he endeavored to suppress   your staying here won t do me  any good       what will you do       oh  read or study  it will give me a chance to catch up in my latin   i was a bit rocky in that yesterday  i can bone away until the  president sends a special message for me       want us to get anything for you   questioned dick      yes  a good fat letter from  well  a fat letter  that s all       postmarked cedarville  and in nellie laning s handwriting   came from  sam slyly      i didn t know they postmarked letters in handwriting   answered tom  innocently      oh  you know what i mean       sure  sam  for i know you re looking for a letter  too  well  run  along  children  and play   said tom  and a minute later sam and dick  set off for ashton     tom did not feel as lighthearted as his words would seem to indicate   he knew that the charge against him was a serious one  and he saw no  way of clearing himself  the finding of the box with his name on it  seemed to be proof positive against him      no use of talking  the minute i get to school i seem to get into  trouble   he soliloquized   wonder if they ll put me in a cell  like  old crabtree did at putnam hall  if they do i ll raise a kick  sure as  eggs are unhatched chickens      tom sat down to study  but he could not fix his mind on his lessons   then he heard somebody come along the hallway and turn into the next  room      must be songbird  or else one of the servants   he thought   guess  i ll take a look   if it was songbird  he could chat with his friend  for a while     he went to the next room  as he opened the door he saw songbird  with  his back toward him  the so styled poet was waving his arms in the air  and declaiming        the weeping winds were whispering through the wood       the rolling rill ran  round the ragged rock     the shepherd  with his sunny  smiling face       was far away to feed his flitting flock     deep in the dingle  dank and dark          i thought i heard an old crow bark    finished tom   say  songbird  how much is that poetry by the yard  or  do you sell it by the ton   he went on     at the sound of tom s voice the would be poet gave a start  but he  quickly recovered  he scowled for a moment and then took on a look of  resignation      you ve spoiled one of the best thoughts i ever had   he said      don t you believe it  songbird   answered tom   i ve heard you make  up poetry worth ten times that  don t you remember that little sonnet  you once composed  entitled  who put ink in willie s shoes   it was  great  grand  sublime       i never wrote such a sonnet   cried songbird   ink in shoes  indeed   tom  you don t know real poetry when you see it       that s a fact  i don t  but  say  what s on the carpet  as the iceman  said to the thrush       nothing  i thought i d write a few verses  that s all  thought you  were going to town with sam and dick       can t   and once again tom had to tell his story  he had not yet  finished when songbird gave an exclamation      it fits in   he cried      fits in  what   asked tom      what i heard a while ago       what did you hear       heard flockley  koswell and larkspur talking together  koswell said  he had fixed you  and that you were having a bad half hour with the  president       where was this       in the library  i was in an alcove  and they didn t see me  i was  busy reading some poetry by longfellow  fine thing  went like this        never mind  chop out the poetry now  songbird  what more did they  say       nothing  they walked away  and i  er  i got so interested in making  up verses i forgot all about it until now       i wish you had heard more  do you know where they went to       no  but i can look around if you want me to       i wish very much that you would  i can t leave  or i d go myself      a few more words followed  and then songbird went off to hunt up the  flockley crowd  on the campus he met max spangler      yes  i saw them   said the german american student in answer to a  question   they are down along the river  just above the boathouse       thank you       i ll show you if you want me to   went on max      you might come along  if you have nothing else to do   answered  songbird     the two walked toward the river  and after a few minutes espied  flockley and the others sitting on some rocks  in the sun  talking  earnestly      i want to hear what they are saying   said songbird   i have a  special reason   and at max s look of surprise he told something of  what had happened      if koswell is that mean he ought to be exposed   said max   i don t  blame him for playing a trick on old sharp  but to lay the blame on  tom  why  that s different       will you come along       if you want me to       i don t want to drag you into trouble  max       i dink i can take care of myself   answered the german american  student     the pair passed around to the rear of the spot where flockley and his  cronies were located  here was a heavy clump of brushwood  so they  were able to draw quite close without being seen     the talk was of a general character for a while  embracing football  and other college sports  and songbird was disappointed  but presently  jerry koswell began to chuckle      i can t help but think of the way i put it over tom rover   he  exclaimed   i ll wager old sharp will make him suffer good and  proper       maybe they ll suspend rover   said bart larkspur   but that would be  carrying it pretty far  wouldn t it       they won t suspend him  but he ll surely be punished   came from dudd  flockley   by the way  are you sure it was a photo of sharp s best  girl       yes  but she isn t a girl  she s a woman  and not particularly  good looking at that   answered jerry koswell      well  sharp isn t so very handsome   answered larkspur   his nose is  as sharp as his name       i suppose rover will wonder how somebody got hold of that case of  pencils and crayons   remarked flockley   if he        hello  max   cried a voice from behind the bushes  and the next  moment a stout youth landed on max spangler s back  carrying him down  with a crash in the brushwood   what are you doing here  anyway      at the interruption the whole flockley crowd started to their feet   and turning  beheld not only max and the boy who had come up so  suddenly  but also songbird  the latter was nearest to them  and  koswell eyed him with sudden suspicion      what are you doing here   he demanded  while max and his friend were  wrestling in a good natured way in the bushes      oh  i ve been listening to some interesting information   answered  songbird      playing the eavesdropper  eh   came from flockley with a sneer      if so  it was for a good purpose   answered the would be poet warmly      say  jerry  you want to look out for him   cried larkspur warningly    he rooms with dick rover  remember  they are old chums       i know that   said koswell  he faced songbird again   how long have  you been here   he cried angrily      that is my business  koswell  but i heard enough of your talk to  know how you tried to put tom rover in a hole  it s a mean piece of  business  and it has got to be stopped       bah       you can  bah   all you please  but i mean what i say  to play a joke  is one thing  to blame it on a fellow student who is innocent is  another  as the poet shelley says  but what s the use of wasting  poetry on a chap like you  max  you heard what was said  didn t you      by this time the german american student was free of his tormentor  a  happy go lucky student named henry cale  he nodded to songbird      yes  i heard it   he said  and gave koswell a meaning look      fine business to be in  listening around corners   sneered larkspur      say that once more and i ll punch your head   cried max  doubling up  his fists      what are you fellows going to do   questioned koswell  he was  beginning to grow alarmed      that depends on what you fellows do   returned songbird      why  er  do you think i am going to the doctor and  er  confess       you have got to clear tom rover       our word is as good as yours   said larkspur      then you are willing to tell a string of falsehoods  eh   said  songbird coldly      i didn t say so       but you meant it  well  larkspur  it won t do  i know about this  and  so does max  koswell has got to clear tom rover  and that is all there  is to it       will you keep quiet about me if i clear rover   asked jerry koswell  eagerly      that depends on what tom rover says  i am going right to him now and  tell him what i heard       and i ll go along   said max  he turned to henry cale   you will have  to excuse me  henry  this is a private affair of importance       sure   was the ready answer   i wouldn t have butted in if i had  known something was doing   and henry walked off toward the college  buildings      just tell tom rover to wait  we ll fix it up somehow   cried jerry  to songbird and max as the pair departed   it s all a  er  a mistake   i m  er  sorry i got rover into it  really i am       no doubt of it  now   answered songbird significantly   evildoers are  usually sorry  after they are caught            chapter xi    how tom escaped punishment      dick and sam were good walkers  so it did not take them long to reach  ashton  while covering the distance they talked over tom s dilemma   but failed to reach any conclusion concerning it      it s too bad   said sam   especially when the term has just opened   it will give tom a black eye       i don t think he ll stand for too much punishment  being innocent   sam  he ll go home first       i was thinking of that  but we don t want to be here with tom gone      arriving at ashton  the boys hurried to the post office  the mail for  the college was in  and among it they found several letters from home  and also epistles from dora stanhope and the laning girls      here s one for tom  that will cheer him up a bit   said dick  holding  up one addressed in nellie laning s well known hand     the boys sat down in an out of the way corner to read their letters   dick had a communication of ten pages from dora  and sam had one of  equal length from grace  then there was one for all the boys from  their father  and another from their aunt martha      the girls are coming next wednesday   said dick   i hope we can get  down to the depot when they arrive       don t forget poor tom  dick       yes  isn t it too bad       nellie will cry her eyes out if he is sent away       oh  we ve got to fix that up somehow      having read the letters carefully  the boys went to one of the stores  to make some purchases  and then drifted down to the depot  a train  was coming in  but they did not expect to see anybody they knew  as a  well dressed young man  carrying a suit case  alighted  both gave an  exclamation      dan baxter      the individual they mentioned will need no introduction to my old  readers  during their days at putnam hall the rover boys had had in  dan baxter and his father enemies who had done their best to ruin  them  the elder baxter had repented after dick had done him a great  service  but dan had kept up his animosity until the rovers imagined  he would be their enemy for life  but at last dan  driven to  desperation by the actions of those with whom he was associating   had also repented  and it was the rovers who had set him on his feet  again  they had loaned him money  and he had gotten a position as a  traveling salesman for a large wholesale house  how he was faring they  did not know  since they had not seen or heard of him for a long time      hello  you here   cried dan baxter  and dropped his suit case on the  depot platform   thought you were at the college       came down for an airing   answered dick  he held out his hand   how  goes it with you  dan       fine  couldn t be better   baxter shook hands with both boys  and  they could not help but notice how clean cut and happy he appeared   quite in contrast to the careless  sullen dan of old      come on business   inquired sam      yes       what are you selling   asked dick      i am in the jewelry line now  representing one of the biggest houses  in the united states  i was going through to cleveland  but i made up  my mind to stop off here and see you  i heard from one of the old boys  that you were here       i am sure i am glad to see you  dan   said dick   and glad to know  you are doing well       maybe you ll be a member of the firm some day   added sam with a  smile      i don t know about that  i m willing to work  and the traveling suits  me first rate  they pay me a good salary  too  thirty dollars per week  and all expenses       good enough   cried dick      i came to see you fellows   went on dan baxter in a lower voice   i  haven t forgotten what you did for me when i was on my uppers  it was  splendid of you  i realize it more every day i live  my father is  with me now  that is  when i m home  we are happier than we ever were  before       that s good   murmured sam      i want to see you all  where is tom       up to the college   sam did not deem it necessary to go into  particulars      i d like to see him  too  i ve got something for each of you       what is that       before i tell you i want you to promise you ll accept it  and by the  way  you got that money back  didn t you       yes       well  will you accept what i want to give you  i want to show you i  appreciate your kindness       we didn t expect anything  dan   said dick      oh  i know that  dick  but please say you ll take what i have for  you  it isn t so very much  but it s something       all right  if you want it that way   answered the oldest rover   seeing that his former enemy was very much in earnest     dan baxter put his hand in an inner pocket and brought forth three  small packages      this is for you  dick  and this for you  sam   he said   the other is  for tom  they are all alike      the two rovers undid the packages handed to them  inside were small  jewelry cases  and each contained a beautiful stickpin of gold   holding a ruby with three small diamonds around it      say  this is fine   murmured sam      dan  we didn t expect this   said dick      but you said you d accept   pleaded baxter   they are all alike  as  i said before  i had the firm make them to order  so there is nothing  else like them on the market  the three diamonds represent you three  brothers  and the ruby  well  when you look at that you can think  of me  if you want to  and another thing   went on baxter  his face  flushing a trifle   the pins are settled for  they didn t come out  of my stock  i mention this because  because    the young traveling  salesman stopped in some confusion      dan  we know you are not that kind   said dick hastily      well  i was  but i m not that kind any longer  everything i do is as  straight as a string  i paid for those stickpins out of my wages  i  hope you will all wear them       i certainly shall   said dick   i shall prize this gift very highly       and so shall i   added sam     dan baxter had heard something about their search for the fortune on  treasure isle  and as they walked over to the hotel for lunch the  rovers gave him some of the details  in return he told them of some  of his experiences on the road while representing a carpet house and  another concern  as well as the jewelry manufacturers  he told them of  several of the former pupils of putnam hall  including fenwick better  known as mumps  who he said was now working in a chicago hotel      you boys can rest assured of one thing   said dan baxter during the  course of the conversation   if i can ever do you a good turn i ll do  it  no matter what it costs me       that is very kind to say  dan   answered    dick   and let me say  if we can do anything more for you we ll do  it      the three youths spent several hours together and then sam and dick  said they would have to get back to college  secretly they were  worried about tom      well  please give the pin to tom   said baxter   and if you feel like  it  write me a letter some day   and he told them of the cities he  expected to visit during his next selling tour  then the rovers and  their one time enemy separated      not at all like the old dan baxter   was sam s comment      he is going to make a fine business man  after all   returned dick    well  i am glad of it  and glad  too  that he and his father are  reconciled to each other      sam and dick had covered about half the distance back to brill when  they saw a figure striding along the country road at a rapid gait      why  say  that looks like tom   cried sam      it is tom   returned his big brother      do you suppose he has run away       i don t know  perhaps the doctor has suspended him       hello   called tom as he came closer   thought i d find you in town  yet  come on back and have some fun       what does this mean  tom   demanded dick  coming to a halt in front  of his brother  he saw at a glance that tom looked rather happy      what does what mean  my dear richard   asked the fun loving rover in  a sweet  girlish voice      you know well enough  did you run away       no  walked away       without permission   asked sam      my dear samuel  you shock me   cried tom in that same girlish voice      see here  let us in on the ground floor of the sphinx   cried dick  impatiently      i will  kind sirs   answered tom  this time in a deep bass voice   i  went to the room and remained there about an hour  songbird went out  on a still hunt  max with him  the two overheard jerry koswell and his  cronies talking  learned jerry did the trick  came back and told me   and        you told the president   finished sam      not on your collar button   answered tom   i waited  the president  sent for me  i went  he tried to get me to confess  and then the  telephone rang  and that did the biz       say  tom  are you crazy   demanded dick      crazy  yes  i m crazy with joy  who wouldn t be to get free so  easily       but explain it   begged sam      i can t explain it  as i said  the president tried to make me  confess  and of course i had nothing to confess  when the telephone  rang i heard one voice and then two others  one after another  i think  they belonged to koswell  flockley and larkspur  but i am not sure   the voices talked to doctor wallington about ten minutes  he got mad  at first and then calmed down  i heard him ask   in professor sharp s  room   and somebody said  yes   four times he asked for names  but i  don t think he got them  then he went out of the office and was gone  about a quarter of an hour  when he returned he said   now  on your  honor  for the last time  rover  did you mar that photograph   and i  said  no   good and hard  then he said he believed me  and was sorry  he had suspected me  and he added that i could go off for the rest of  the day and enjoy myself  and here i am       and you didn t squeal on koswell   company   asked sam      nary a squeal       do you imagine they confessed       i think they told the president over the  phone that i was innocent   maybe the three swore to it  but i don t think they gave their names       what did they mean about sharp s room       i was curious about that  and i found out from one of the servants   sharp found an envelope under the door  it contained a five dollar  bill  and on it was written in a scrawl   for a new photograph        koswell   company got scared mightily   mused dick   well  i am glad   tom  that you are out of it       and as a token of your escape we ll present you with this   added  sam  and brought forth the package from dan baxter  tom was much  surprised  and listened to the story about the former bully of putnam  hall with interest      good for dan   he cried   i ll write him a letter the first chance i  get       and here s a letter from nellie   said dick   and one from father   and another from aunt martha       hurrah  that s the best yet   exclaimed tom   i ve got to read  em  all  sit down and rest   and he dropped down on a grassy bank and his  brothers followed suit           chapter xii    in which the girls arrive       you may be sure of one thing  tom   remarked dick while he and his  brothers were walking back to brill  some time later   jerry koswell  has it in for you  you had better watch him closely       i intend to do so   answered tom   but there is another thing which  both of you seem to have forgotten  that s about the dress suit case   did koswell find it  and if so  did he take anything else besides the  box of pencils and crayons       he ll never admit it   put in sam   not unless you corner him  as  songbird did about the photo       he ll have to tell where he got the box  sam       i doubt if you get any satisfaction      and sam was right  as later events proved  when tom tackled koswell  the latter said positively that he knew nothing of the dress suit  case  he said he had found the box on a stand in the hallway near  professor sharp s door  and had used it because it suited his purpose      but you saw it had my name on it   said tom      no  i didn t  it was rather dark in the hall  and all i saw was that  it contained pencils and crayons   answered jerry koswell      well  i don t believe you   answered tom abruptly   you did it on  purpose  and maybe some day i ll be able to prove it   and he walked  off  leaving koswell in anything but a comfortable frame of mind     tom was curious to see how professor sharp would act after the affair   during the first recitation the instructor seemed ill at ease  but  after that he acted as usual  tom half suspected the professor still  thought him guilty      well  it was a pretty mean thing to do   soliloquized the fun loving  rover   if anybody did that to a picture of nellie i d mash him into a  jelly      all of the rovers were awaiting the arrival of the girls with  interest  and each was fearful that some poor recitation might keep  him from going to meet them at the ashton depot on wednesday  but   luckily  all got permission to go to town  and they started without  delay as soon as the afternoon session was ended      where bound   asked songbird  in some surprise  as he saw them  driving off in a carriage dick had ordered by telephone      going to meet dora and nellie and grace   answered dick   do  you  er  want to come along       oh  sure  i ll see them all home myself   answered the would be poet  with a wink of his eye   no  thank you  i know enough to keep out  of somebody else s honey pot  give them my regards   he added  and  strolled off  murmuring softly        if them love me as i love thee     how happy thee and i will be      the boys got down to the depot ahead of time  and were then told that  the train was fifteen minutes late  they put in the time as best they  could  although every minute seemed five      hello  there is dudd flockley   exclaimed sam presently  and pointed  to the dudish student  who was crossing the street behind the depot      maybe he came down to meet somebody  too   said tom   more than  likely there will be quite a bunch of girls bound for the seminary      at last the train rolled in  and the three rovers strained their eyes  to catch the first sight of their friends      there they are   shouted dick  and pointed to a parlor car  he ran  forward  and so did his brothers  the porter was out with his box  but  it was the boys who assisted the girls to alight  and dick who tipped  the knight of the whisk broom      here at last   cried dick   we are so glad you ve come       thought the train would never get here   added sam      longest wait i ve had since i was able to walk   supplemented tom      oh  tom  you big tease   answered nellie merrily  and caught him by  both hands      yes  we are late   said dora a bit soberly  she gave dick s hand a  tight squeeze  they looked at each other  and on the instant he saw  that she had something to tell him      how long it seems since we saw you last   said grace as she took  sam s hand  then there was handshaking all around  and all the girls  and boys tried to speak at once  to learn how the others had been  since they had separated after the treasure hunt      we ll have to look after our trunks   said dora   there they are    and she pointed to where they had been dumped on a truck      i ll take care of the baggage   said tom   just give me the checks       and we ve got to find a carriage to take us to hope   added grace      all arranged   answered sam   we are going to take you up  dick is  going to take dora in a buggy  and tom and i are going to take you and  nellie in a two seated  the baggage can go in a wagon behind       but i thought there was a seminary stage   began grace      there is  and if you d rather take it        oh  no  the carriage ride will be much nicer   and grace looked at  sam in a manner that made his heart beat much faster than before      do you know  it seems awfully queer to be rich and to be going to a  fine boarding school   said nellie   i declare  i m not used to it  yet  but i m glad on papa and mamma s account  for neither of them  have to work as hard as they did       papa is going to improve the farm wonderfully   said grace   he is  going to put up a new barn and a carriage house and a new windmill for  pumping water  and he has bought a hundred acres from the farm in the  back  and added  oh  i don t know how many more cows  and we ve got a  splendid team of horses  and the cutest pony you ever saw  and next  year he is going to rebuild the wing of the house and put on a big  piazza  where we can have rocking chairs and a hammock        yum  yum   murmured sam   the hammock for mine  when i call       built for two  i suppose   remarked dick dryly      dick rover   cried grace  and blushed      he ll want it for himself and dor    began sam      here comes tom   interrupted dick hastily   all right about the  baggage   he asked loudly      all right  the trunks and cases will go to the seminary inside of an  hour   answered tom   so we might as well be off ourselves  we can  drive slowly  you know       well  you can go ahead and set the pace   answered his elder brother     the buggy and the carriage were already on hand  and soon the boys and  girls were in the turnouts  and tom drove off  with dick following     as they did so they saw dudd flockley standing near  eyeing them  curiously  they had to drive close to the dudish student  who was  attired in his best  and he stared boldly at dora and the laning  girls      what a bold young man   was dora s comment after they had passed      he s a student at brill   answered dick   not a very nice kind   either   dick was much put out  for he did not like any young man to  stare at dora     ashton was soon left behind  and carriage and buggy bowled along  slowly over a country road lined on either side with trees and bushes  and tidy farms  under the trees dick allowed his horse to drop into a  walk  and managed to drive with one hand while the other found dora s  waist and held it      dick  somebody might see you   she half whispered      well  i can t help it  dora   he answered   it s been such a long  time since we met       yes  it seems like years and years  doesn t it       and to think we ve got to go through college before  before we can        yes  but dick  isn t it splendid that we are going to be so close to  each other  why  we ll be able to meet lots of times       if the seminary authorities will let you  i understand they are very  strict       oh  well  we ll meet anyhow  won t we       if you say so  dear       why  yes  dear  that is  oh  now see what you ve done   knocked  my hat right down on my ear  now  you mustn t  one is enough  just  suppose another carriage should come up  with somebody in it from the  seminary       i ve got my eye open   answered dick   but just one more  and then  you can fix your hat  they ve got to make some allowance for folks  that are engaged   he added softly  as he pressed her cheek close to  his own      are we engaged  dick   she asked as she adjusted her hat      aren t we   he demanded   why  of course we are       well  if you say so  but  but  i suppose some folks would think we  were rather young       well  i m not so young as i used to be  and i m growing older every  day       so am i  i am not near as young as i was when we first met  on that  little steamboat on cayuga lake  when you and tom and sam were going  to putnam hall for the first time       no  you re not quite so young  dora  but you are just as pretty  in  fact  you re prettier than ever       oh  you just say that       i mean it  and i m the happiest fellow in the world this minute    cried dick  and caught her again in his arms  once more the hat went  over on dora s ear  but this time she forgot to mention it  truth to  tell  for the time being she was just as happy as he was     but presently her face grew troubled  and he remembered the look she  had given him at the depot      something is on your mind  dora   he said   what is it       dick  do you know that tad sobber is alive  that he escaped from that  dreadful hurricane in west indian waters       yes  i know it  but i didn t know it until a few days ago  when  songbird powell came to brill he said he had met sobber in ithaca       he came to see mamma       i was afraid he would  what did he say       he came one evening  after supper  it was dark and stormy  and he  drove up in a buggy  mamma and i and the servants were home alone   although nellie had been over in the afternoon  he rang the bell  and  asked for mamma  and the girl ushered him into the parlor  he asked  the girl if we had company  and he said if we had he wouldn t bother  us       guess he was afraid of being arrested       perhaps so  he told the girl he was a friend from new york  i went  down first  and when i saw him i was almost scared to death  i thought  i was looking at a ghost       naturally  since you thought he had been drowned  it s too bad he  scared you so  dora       he said he had come on business  and without waiting began to talk  about the treasure we had taken from the isle  he insisted upon it  that the treasure belonged to him  since his uncle  sid merrick  was  dead  when my mother came in he demanded that she give him some money  and sign some papers       what did your mother do       she refused  of course  then he got very wild and talked in a  rambling fashion  oh  dick  i am half inclined to think he is crazy    and dora shuddered      what did he say after your mother refused to do as he wished       he got up and walked around the parlor  waving his hands and crying  that we were robbing him  that the treasure was his  and that the  rovers were nothing but thieves  then mamma ordered him out of the  house and sent the girl to get the man who runs the farm for us  but  before the man came sobber went away  driving his horse as fast as he  could       have you heard from him since       yes  the next day we got an unsigned letter  in it sobber said that   by hook or by crook  he intended to get possession of the treasure   and for the rovers to beware            chapter xiii    the rowing race      having told so much  dora went into all the particulars of tad  sobber s visit to the stanhope homestead  she told of how sobber had  argued  and she said he had affirmed that the rovers had falsified  matters so that the stanhopes and the lanings might benefit thereby      what he says is absolutely untrue   said dick   father went over  those papers with care  and so did the lawyers  and the treasure  belongs to you and the lanings  and to nobody else       don t you think sid merrick fooled sobber   asked the girl      perhaps  but i guess tad was willing to be fooled  they set their  hearts on that money  and now tad can t give it up  in one way i am  sorry for him  and if a small amount of cash would satisfy him and set  him on his feet  i d hand it over  we put dan baxter on his feet that  way       oh  but baxter isn t sobber  dick  sobber is wild and wicked  i was  so afraid he would attack mamma and me i hardly knew what to do  and  his eyes rolled so when he talked       did he go to the lanings       no       probably he was afraid of your uncle  mr  laning won t stand for any  nonsense  i suppose your mother is afraid he ll come back       yes  and to protect herself she has hired one of the farm men to  sleep in the house  the man was once in the army  and he knows how to  use a gun       then that will make sobber keep his distance  he is a coward at  heart  i found that out when we went to putnam hall together       but you must beware of him  dick  he may show himself here next       it won t do him any good  all i ve got here is a little spending  money  no  i don t think he ll show himself here  more than likely  he ll try to hire some shyster lawyer to fight for the treasure in the  courts  but i don t think he ll be able to upset your claim      they had now reached hope seminary  and the conversation came to an  end  the boys helped the girls to alight  and said good by  then they  drove back to ashton  where the buggy was left at the livery stable   and all piled into the carriage for the college  on the way dick told  his brothers about tad sobber      dora is right  he is a bad egg   said sam   i wouldn t trust him  under any consideration       he is too much of a coward to attack anybody openly   was tom s  comment   but as dick says  he may hire some shyster lawyer to take  the matter into the courts  it would be too bad if the fortune was  tied up in endless litigation       he s got to get money to fight with first   said dick      oh  some lawyers will take a case like that on a venture       that s true      several days passed quietly  and the rover boys applied themselves  diligently to their studies  for they wished to make fine records at  brill      we are here to get a good education   was the way dick expressed  himself   and we want to make the most of our time       as if i wasn t boning away to beat the band   murmured tom  reproachfully      i d like to take the full course in about two years   came from sam      college studies are mighty hard   broke in songbird  who was working  over his chemistry   i don t get any chance to write poetry any more       for which let us all be truly thankful   murmured sam to tom      ten minutes more   announced dick  looking at his watch   then what  do you say to a row on the river       suits me   cried tom      all right  then  now clear out  and  silence      a quarter of an hour later the rover boys and songbird walked down to  the river  there were plenty of boats to be had  and dick and tom were  soon out  songbird and sam received an invitation to go for a ride in  a gasolene launch owned by stanley      suits me   cried the would be poet   i can row any time  but i can t  always ride in a motor boat       same here   said sam     a number of craft were on the river  including one containing jerry  koswell and bart larkspur  koswell scowled as he saw tom and dick  rowing near by      we ll give  em a shaking up   he said to his crony  and turned their  rowboat so that it bumped fairly and squarely into the craft manned by  tom and dick  the shock was so great that dick  who had gotten up to  fix his seat  was nearly hurled overboard      see here  what do you mean by running into us   demanded the oldest  rover on recovering his balance      sorry  but it couldn t be helped   answered koswell   why didn t you  get out of the way       we didn t have to   retorted sam   and if you try that trick again  somebody will get his head punched       talk is cheap   sneered larkspur      say  i heard you fellows have been boasting of how you can row   went  on koswell after a pause      we haven t been boasting  but we can row   answered tom      want to race       when       now       i don t know as i care to race with a chap like you  koswell    answered dick pointedly      you re afraid       no  i am not afraid       let us race them   whispered tom to his brother   i am not afraid of  them       oh  neither am i  tom       well race you to rock island and back   said koswell  after  consulting larkspur      all right   answered dick      want to bet on the result   questioned koswell  he was usually  willing to bet on anything      we don t bet   answered tom      and we wouldn t with you  if we did   added dick   i don t think you  are in our class  koswell  and you never will be  at the same time   since you are so anxious to row against us  we ll race you  and beat  you      this answer enraged jerry koswell  and he dared the rovers to wager  ten dollars on the race  they would not  but others took up the bet   and then several other wagers were made     rock island was a small  stony spot half a mile up the stream  so  the race would be about a mile in length  frank holden was chosen  as referee and umpire  and all of the contestants prepared for the  struggle      your boat is lighter than that of the rovers   said holden to koswell  and larkspur   you really ought to give them some lead       no  this is an even start   growled koswell      very well  but it doesn t seem quite fair      it was soon noised around that the race was to take place  and the  river bank speedily became lined with students anxious to see how the  contest would terminate      now  tom  take it easy at the start  but finish up strong   cautioned  dick      i feel like pulling a strong stroke from the first   answered tom    let us do it  and leave them completely in the shade       no  we must first try to find out what they can do       say  you ve got to beat  em   came from sam  as the launch came  close   if they win you ll never hear the end of it       they re not going to win   answered dick  quietly but firmly      all ready   asked frank holden  as the boats drew up side by side  near the boathouse float      we are   sang out tom      ready   answered jerry koswell      go   shouted frank     four pairs of oars dropped into the water simultaneously  and away  shot the two craft side by side  there was no disguising the fact  that koswell and larkspur were good oarsmen  and what was equally  important  they had done much practicing together  on the other hand   while dick and tom could row well  they had pulled together but twice  since coming to brill      you ve got your work cut out for you   shouted songbird   but never  mind  go in and win      for the first quarter of a mile the two row boats kept close together   occasionally one would forge ahead a few inches  but the other would  speedily overtake it  then  however  the rover boys settled down to a  strong  steady stroke  and forged a full length ahead      see  see  the rovers are winning   shouted max in delight      that s the way to do it   cried stanley   keep it up  you re doing  nobly       show  em the way home   added songbird      pull  jerry  pull   bart   screamed dudd flockley to his cronies    don t let them beat you      before long the island was reached  and the rovers rounded it a length  and a half ahead  this made jerry koswell frantic  and he called on  larkspur to increase the stroke      all right  i m with you   was the short answer     the increase in the stroke speedily told  and inch by inch the second  boat began to overhaul the first then tom made a miss  sending a  shower of water into the air  at this the craft containing koswell and  larkspur shot ahead      hurrah  that s the way to do it   yelled flockley in delight   even  money on the green boat       take you   answered spud jackson promptly   how much       a fiver       all right       steady  tom   cautioned dick   now  then ready       yes       then bend to it  one  two  three  four      again the rover boys went at the rowing with a will  increasing their  stroke until it was six to the minute more than that of koswell and  larkspur  the latter were frantic  and tried to do likewise  but found  it impossible  inch by inch the rovers  craft went ahead  now it was  half a length  then a length  then two lengths      say  there is rowing for you   was the comment of a senior   just  look at them bend to it       yes  and look at the quick recovery   added another fourth year  student     from two lengths the rovers went three lengths ahead  then koswell  missed a stroke  and tumbled up against larkspur      hi  what are you doing   spluttered larkspur in disgust      cou  couldn t hel  help it   panted jerry  he was all but winded  for  the pulling had been too much for him      the rovers win  the rovers win   was the shout that went up  and in  the midst of the hubbub dick and tom crossed the line  winning by at  least six lengths  koswell and larkspur were so disgusted that they  did not even finish  but stopped rowing and turned away from the  float      the rovers win   announced frank holden   a fine race  too   he  added   let me congratulate you   and he waved his hand pleasantly to  dick and tom      i got a pain in my side  and that made me miss the stroke   said  jerry koswell lamely   some day i ll race them again  and win  too       you should have won this time   growled dudd flockley when he was  alone with his cronies   i dropped twenty dollars on that race       i never thought they could row like that   was larkspur s comment   i  don t think i want to row against them again      dick and tom were warmly congratulated by all their friends  it had  been a well earned victory  and they were correspondingly happy   koswell was sourer than ever against them  and vowed he would  square  up  somehow  and larkspur agreed to help him  dudd flockley was glum   for his spending money for the month was running low  and it was going  to be hard to pay the wagers he had lost           chapter xiv    william philander tubes      on the following saturday the rover boys went down to ashton in the  afternoon  they had arranged for the hire of a large touring car  with  a competent chauffeur  and were to take dora and the laning girls out  for a ride to another town called toddville  here they were to have  supper at the hotel  returning to ashton in the evening     lest it be thought strange that the girls could get permission from  the seminary authorities to absent themselves  let me state that  matters had been explained by mrs  stanhope and mrs  laning to the  principal of hope  so dora and her cousins were free to go out with  the rovers whenever they could go out at all      we ll have the best time ever   cried tom enthusiastically   i hope  you ordered a fine supper over the telephone  dick       i did   was the reply   just the things i know the girls like       and a bouquet of flowers   added sam  he knew that grace loved  flowers      yes  i didn t forget them  sam      the boys arrived in ashton a little ahead of time  and while waiting  for the chauffeur of the car to appear they walked down to the depot  to see if there would be any new arrivals on the saturday special     when the train pulled into the depot a tall  well dressed youth  with  an elaborate dress suit case and a bag of golf sticks  descended from  the parlor car and gazed around him wonderingly      are you  ah  sure this is  ah  ashton   he inquired of the porter      yes  sah   was the brisk answer      not a  ah  very large place  is it  now   drawled the passenger      look who s here   burst out tom as he hurried forward      why  it s tubbs  william philander tubbs   ejaculated sam     and sure enough  it was tubbs  the most dudish pupil putnam hall had  ever known  and one with whom the cadets had had no end of fun      my dear old buttertub  how are you   called out tom loudly  and  caught the new arrival by the shoulder   how are you  and how is the  wife  and the eight children       why  ah  is it really tom rover   gasped tubbs  he stared at tom and  then at dick and sam   what are you  ah  doing here  may i inquire   but please   he added hurriedly   don t call me buttertub  and don t  say i have a wife and children  when i haven t   and tubbs looked  around to see if anybody had overheard tom s remark      we go to school here   said dick as he shook hands   brill college       well  i never   gasped the tall dude   brill  did you say       that s it   put in sam      i am going there myself       you   roared tom   hail columbia  happy land  that s the best yet   tubblets  we ll have dead loads of fun  did you bring your pet poodle  and your fancywork  and those beautiful red and yellow socks you used  to wear       i hope you didn t forget that green and pink necktie you used to  have   came from sam   and the blue handkerchief with the purple  variegated border       i  ah  i never had those things   stormed tubbs   oh  say  do you  really go to brill   he questioned  with almost a groan in his voice      sure as you re born   answered dick   we ll be glad to have you  there  william philander  you ll be a credit to the institution  we  have a few fellows who dress well  but you ll top them all  i know  it       do you  ah  really think i can  ah  i will be as well dressed as  the  ah  as anybody   asked the dude eagerly  he was a fair scholar   but his mind was constantly on the subject of what to wear and how to  wear it      oh  you ll lead the bunch  and all the girls at hope will fall dead  in love with you   answered tom      hope  what do you mean       that s the seminary for girls  fine lot of girls there  waiting to  see you  philliam willander       william philander  please  so there is a girls  school here  eh   that s  ah  very nice  yes  i like the girls  i always did  but  tom   please don t call me  ah  buttertub  i think it s horrid  don t you  know       all right  washtub  anything you say stands still   answered tom  cheerfully   i wouldn t hurt your feelings for a million warts       there is the carriage for brill   said sam  pointing it out      are you going with me   asked the dude      no  we are not going back until this evening   explained dick   we ll  see you later       only one other student going with you   added tom mischievously    he s kind of queer  but i guess he won t hurt you   he had seen an  innocent  quiet youth  named smith  getting into the college turnout      queer   asked tubbs      yes  gets fits  or something like that  he won t hurt you if you keep  your hand to your nose       my  ah  my hand to my nose       yes   went on tom innocently   you see  he has an idea that folks are  smelling things  so if you keep your hand to your nose he will know  you are not smelling anything  so he ll keep quiet       i don t  ah  know as i like that   stammered william philander      carriage for the college   called the driver  approaching  and before  he could say anything the rovers had tubbs in the turnout      mr  smith  mr  tubbs   said dick  introducing the students  smith  bowed  and so did tubbs  then the hand of the dude went up to his nose  and stayed there      good by  see you later   cried tom      be careful   warned sam  and tapped his nose      i  i think i d  ah  rather walk   groaned tubbs      it s too far   answered dick  then the carriage rolled away  as it  passed out of sight they saw william philander with his hand still  tight on his olfactory organ      wonder what smith will think   remarked dick after the three brothers  had had a good laugh over the sight      he ll certainly think tubblets queer   answered sam      tubby will be a barrel of fun   said tom   i m mighty glad he s come   it will aid to brighten up our existence considerably      the rover boys were soon on their way to where they were to meet the  girls  at a point on the road some distance from hope seminary  soon  the whole crowd was in the big touring car  and away they skimmed over  a road which  if it was not particularly good  was likewise by no  means bad      and where are we going   asked dora  for that had been kept a secret      to a town about twenty miles from here   said dick   we are to have  supper there  at the hotel       how nice   came in a chorus from the girls     i just love automobiling   said nellie   i wish i had a car       i ll get you one   said tom  and added in a whisper   just wait till  we are settled down we ll have the finest auto rides that        tom rover   cried nellie  and then blushed and giggled   oh  look at  the beautiful autumn leaves   she added  to change the subject  but a  second later she gave tom an arch look that meant a good deal  they  seemed to understand each other fully as well as did dick and dora     the ride to toddville was one long to be remembered  they talked and  sang  and the boys told of the meeting with tubbs and the joke played   and this set the girls almost in hysterics  for they were acquainted  with the dude  and knew his peculiarities     when they arrived at the hotel the spread was almost ready for them   and by the time they had washed and brushed up all felt rather hungry   there was a fine bouquet on the table  and in addition a tiny one at  each plate      oh  how nice   cried grace      let me pin this on you   said dora to dick  and fastened the small  bouquet in his buttonhole  the other girls performed a like service  for tom and sam     the meal was served in a private dining room  so all felt free to  act as if they were at home  they talked and cracked jokes to their  hearts  content  and the boys told their best stories  they also grew  serious at times  talking of home and their folks      mamma hasn t heard another word from tad sobber   said dora to dick      and i hope he never appears again   answered the oldest rover     the meal was about half finished when one of the waiters came to dick  and said the chauffeur would like to speak to him      very well   answered the oldest rover  and excusing himself to the  others  he went out into the hallway      i ve just got a telephone message from raytown   said the chauffeur    my brother has been hurt at a fire there  and they want me  i don t  know what to do  i might send for another man to run the car  but  you ll have to wait until he comes  would you be willing to do that       i might run the car myself   answered dick  he could see that the  chauffeur was much worried over the news he had received      could you do that  sir  if you could it would help me out a whole  lot  my brother has a wife and two little children  and she ll be  scared to death if bill is injured       then go right along  only see to it that the car is in good working  order   answered dick  and then he followed the chauffeur to the shed  where the automobile was stored  and had the peculiar working of that  make of car explained to him  as my old readers know  dick had driven  a car before  and understood very well how to do it     as there was no particular need for hurrying  and as it promised to be  a fine moonlight night  the rover boys and their company did not leave  the hotel until nearly eight o clock  then dick lit the lamps of the  machine and ran it around to the piazza  and the others bundled in      are you sure you can run this car  dick   asked dora a bit timidly      oh  yes  dora  it is of a make that i have run before  only the other  was a five seat instead of a seven  but this one runs the same way       dick is a born chauffeur   said sam   wait till you see him let the  car out to sixty miles an hour       mercy  i don t want to run as fast as that   cried grace      we d all be killed if anything should happen   added nellie      don t you worry  dick will crawl along at three miles per   drawled  tom   the moonlight is too fine to run fast  besides  dora is going to  sit in front with him       i ll make the run in about an hour and a half   said dick   and that  is fast enough  we don t want to get back too early       might go around the block   suggested sam      around the block would mean about fifteen miles extra   said dora   who knew all about country  blocks       i don t know the roads  so i ll keep to the one we came on   answered  dick   all ready  then off we go   he added  and started on low speed   which he soon changed to second and then high   this is something  like   he cried as he settled back with his hands on the wheel      keep your eyes on the road  and not on dora   cautioned tom      say another word and i ll drag you from nellie and make you run the  car   retorted dick  and then tom shut up promptly     mile after mile was covered  and dick proved that he could run the big  automobile fully as well as the regular driver  the moon was shining  brightly  so that it was very pleasant  the party sang songs and  enjoyed themselves immensely     they were still two miles from ashton when they came to a turn in the  road  here there were a number of trees  and it was much darker than  it had been  dick slowed up a trifle and peered ahead     suddenly the front lamps of the machine shone down on something in the  roadway that sent back a strange sparkle of light  dick bent forward  and uttered an exclamation of dismay  he turned off the power and  jammed on both brakes      what s the matter   cried sam and tom in a breath  and the girls gave  a scream of fear     bang  came a report from under the car     one of the tires had burst           chapter xv    an automobiling adventure       what did you run over   asked sam      look for yourself   returned his big brother   this is an outrage  i  wish i could catch the party responsible for it   he added bitterly     dick had stopped the touring car in the midst of a quantity of broken  glass bottles  the glass covered the road from side to side  and had  evidently been put there on purpose      say  do you think that chauffeur had anything to do with this    demanded tom      hardly   answered dick   if his story about the fire was not true  he d know he d be found out       maybe it was done by some country fellow who is running an auto  repair shop   suggested sam   i ve heard of such things being  done  when business was dull       well  we ll have to fix the tire  that is all there is to it   said  the oldest rover   might as well get out while we are doing it   he  added to the girls      lucky you stopped when you did   said tom as he walked around the  machine   if you hadn t we might have had all four tires busted       what a contemptible trick to play   said dora as she alighted      can you mend the tire   asked nellie as she  too  got out  followed  by her sister      oh  yes  we can mend it  or rather put on another   said dick   but  we ll examine all the tires first   he added  taking off a lamp for  that purpose     it was found that each tire had some glass in it  and the bits were  picked out with care  while this was going on dick suddenly swung  the lamp around so that its rays struck through the trees and bushes  lining the roadway      look  look   he cried   there is somebody watching us       the fellow who is guilty   added sam      catch him   came from tom  and he made a quick rush forward      say  we ve got to get out of here   came in a low voice from among  the trees   run for all you are worth       i told you to get back   said another voice  come on this way      a crashing through the brushwood back of the trees followed  dick held  up the lamp and threw the rays in the direction of the sounds  he and  his brothers caught a glimpse of two boys or men hurrying away      stop  or i ll shoot   cried tom  although he had no weapon at his  command  but this cry only made the fleeing ones move the faster      sam  you stay with the girls   said dick quickly   tom and i can go  after those rascals       all right  but take care  they may be dangerous   answered the  youngest rover     tom had picked up a good sized stone  now he hurled it ahead into the  bushes  a cry of alarm followed  but whether he hit anybody or not he  could not till     holding the lamp so that it would light up the scene ahead  dick  and tom ran through the grove of trees and then into the thicket of  brushwood beyond  they could hear two persons working their way along   and knew they must be the fellows they were after  once they caught  sight of the rascals  but the evildoers lost no time in seeking cover  by running for another patch of undergrowth      say  this is fierce   cried tom as he stepped into a hole and tumbled  headlong      well  it s just as bad for those fellows   answered dick grimly      yes  but i reckon they are not dressed up as we are   tom had on his  tuxedo and a white tie  and dick was similarly attired  but over the  dress suit each wore a linen coat  buttoned close up to the neck     the two youths kept on until  much to their surprise  they came out on  a back road that was almost as good as the highway they had left  here  was a rail fence  and as they halted at this tom pointed down the road  a distance      somebody on wheels   he cried   turn the light on  em      dick did as requested  and to their astonishment they beheld two  young fellows on bicycles  they had their heads bent low over the  handlebars  and were streaking along at top speed  soon a bend of the  road hid them from view      those are the chaps who put that glass in the roadway   said tom      i believe you   answered his brother   they came up here on their  wheels and walked through the woods to do it  the question is  who are  they       they are enemies of ours   was the prompt answer      yes  but how did they know we were coming this way  and in the auto       they might have overheard us talking to songbird or stanley       can they be flockley and koswell       more likely koswell and larkspur  flockley hasn t the backbone to do  a thing like this  he s too much of a dude      dick and tom took a look around the vicinity  by the light of the  lamp they saw where the others had leaped the fence and mounted their  bicycles      they are the guilty ones  i am sure of that   said dick   i wish we  had seen their faces      the youths went back to the auto and told of their adventure  sam and  the girls listened with interest to what they had to say      those boys must be very wicked   said nellie   if we had been running  fast we might have had a serious accident       shall you accuse them of it   asked dora      i don t know  i ll think it over   answered dick      the cut up tire has got to be paid for   said tom   whoever is guilty  ought to be made to foot the bill      while dick and sam jacked up the axle of the automobile and put on a  new tire  inner tube and shoe combined  sam set to work and cleaned up  the roadway  throwing all the glass into the bushes  then the new tire  was pumped up and tested      now we are all right again   said dick      i am glad we had to mend but one   said tom  he felt pretty dirty  from the job  but he was not going to tell the girls     all entered the touring car again  and dick turned on the power  he  ran slowly at first to test the new tire      all o k    he announced presently  and then they went spinning along  as before  but the  edge  had been taken off the ride  and they did  not seem as free hearted and full of fun as they had been before the  mishap     it was after ten o clock when the seminary was reached  and the girls  found one of the under teachers waiting for them      young ladies  you were told to be in at ten   said the teacher  severely   it is now half after       we had an accident   answered dora  and told what it was      you must not stay away later than the time originally allowed   said  the teacher severely   remember that after this  please   and then she  dismissed the girls     when the boys got to the garage where the automobile belonged they  told the man in charge about the chauffeur and of what had happened on  the road  the garage manager could hardly believe the story about the  broken glass      you ll have to pay for that tire   he said coldly   you can t expect  to make me stand the loss       i suppose not   answered dick  you can have the old tire repaired and  send the bill to me  and now i want somebody to take us up to brill  just as quickly as it can be done  it is getting late       i ll get a man right away   said the manager in a relieved tone  and  two minutes later the three rover boys were being whirled toward the  college      do you think those fellows are back yet   questioned sam as they sped  along the road      that s what i want to find out   returned dick   that is  provided  they came from here      they left the car at the entrance to the grounds  and the chauffeur at  once turned around and started back for ashton      we ll take a look around the gymnasium first   said dick   that is  where they keep the bicycles and such things      they hurried in the direction of the gymnasium  and finding the door  unlocked  entered  the building was dark and deserted  for it was now  after eleven o clock      hello there   called a voice from a distance  and a watchman  appeared  lantern in hand   what s wanted       we want to look at the bicycles  pinkey   answered dick      the bicycles  ain t goin  for no ride this time o  night  are you    asked the watchman      no  we want to see if any of them have been used       think somebody has been usin  your machine on the sly      to this question the rovers did not reply  for the reason that they  had no bicycles at brill  the watchman led the way to the bicycle  room  here were about twenty bicycles and half a dozen motor cycles   all belonging to various students      ain t half as many as there used to be   remarked pinkey   when the  craze was on we had about a hundred an  fifty  it s all automobiling  now      the boys looked over the various wheels and felt of the working  parts and the lamps  presently sam found a hot lamp and dick located  another      who do these machines belong to   asked dick      there s the list   said the watchman  pointing to a written sheet  tacked on the wall  they are no     and no         the boys looked at the sheet  and read the names of walter d  flood  and andrew w  crossley  two juniors  whom they knew by sight only      they wouldn t play this trick on us   whispered dick to his brothers    they must have loaned their bicycles to others       right you are   answered tom   we ll have to question them       do you know where they room       no  but we can find out from the register      they entered their dormitory and found out that flood and crossley  were in the next building  occupying room    together      that s luck   said sam  we won t have to wake up anybody else     it was against the rules to be prowling around the dormitories so late  at night  so the rovers had to be cautious in their movements  they  mounted the stairs to the second floor and had to hide in a corner  while a proctor marched past and out of hearing  then  aided by the  dim light that was burning  they located no        dick knocked lightly on the door  and receiving no answer  knocked  again  still there was silence      must be pretty heavy sleepers   murmured tom   try the doorknob      dick did so  and found the door locked  then he knocked again  this  time louder than before      you ll knock a long time to wake them up   said a voice behind them   and turning they saw frank holden grinning at them      hello   said dick softly   why  what s wrong       nobody in that room  that s all   answered the sophomore      don t flood and crossley sleep here   asked sam      yes  when they are at college  but they got permission to go home  yesterday  and they went  and they won t be back until monday      at this dick whistled softly to himself      it s all up  so far as finding out who used the wheels is concerned    he said to his brothers   whoever took them did so  most likely   without permission       i guess you are right   returned tom      anything i can do for you   asked frank holden pleasantly      nothing  thank you   replied dick  and then he and his brothers  withdrew and made their way to their own rooms as silently as  possible  on the way they stopped at the doors of the rooms occupied  by koswell and larkspur and listened  the students within were  snoring      no use   said tom softly   we ll have to catch them some other  way  if they are guilty   and his brothers agreed with him           chapter xvi    something about a cane      but if koswell and larkspur were guilty  they kept very quiet about  it  and the rover boys were unable to prove anything against them  the  bill for the cut up tire came to dick  and he paid it     the college talk was now largely about football  and one day a notice  was posted that all candidates for admission on the big eleven should  register at the gymnasium      i think i ll put my name down   said tom      and i ll do the same   returned dick   but i doubt if well get much  of a show  since they know nothing of our playing qualities here      there were about thirty candidates  including thirteen who had played  on the big team before  but two of these candidates were behind in  then studies  and had to be dropped  by order of the faculty      that leaves a full eleven anyway of old players   said sam   not much  hope for you   he added to his brothers      they ll do considerable shifting  every college team does   said  dick  and he was right  after a good deal of scrub work and a general  sizing up of the different candidates  four of the old players were  dropped  while another went to the substitutes  bench     it was now a question between nine of the new candidates  and after  another tryout dick was put in as a guard  he having shown an  exceptional fitness for filling that position  tom got on the  substitutes  bench  which was something  if not much  then practice  began in earnest  for the college was to play a game against roxley   another college  on a saturday  ten days later      i hope you win  dick   said sam   and it s a pity you didn t get on  the gridiron  tom   he continued      oh  i ll get on  sooner or later   answered tom with a grin    football is no baby play  and somebody is bound to get hurt       you re not wishing that  are you   asked songbird      no  indeed  but i know how it goes  haven t i been hurt myself  more  than once      the football game was to take place at brill  on the athletic field   and the college students were privileged to invite a certain number of  their friends  the rovers promptly invited dora  nellie and grace  and  it was arranged that sam should see to it that the girls got there      sam will have as good a time as anybody   said tom   he ll have the  three girls all to himself       well  you can t have everything in this world   replied the youngest  rover with a grin   i guess football honors will be enough for you  this time       if we win   put in dick   i understand roxley has a splendid eleven  this season  they won out at stanwell yesterday     to          i hear they are heavier than we are   said tom   at least ten pounds  to the man  that is going to count for something      at that moment william philander tubbs came up  he was attired  as  usual  in the height of fashion  and sported a light gold headed cane      for gracious sake  look at tubby   exclaimed sam   talk about a  fashion plate       hello  billy boy   called out tom   going to make a social call on  your washerwoman       no  he s going to town to buy a pint of peanuts   said sam      i thought he might be going to a funeral dressed so soberly   added  dick  and this caused a general laugh  for tubbs was attired in a  light gray suit  patent leathers with spats  and a cream colored  necktie  with gloves to match      how do you do   said william philander politely  as if he had not  seen the others in the classrooms an hour before   pleasant day       looks a bit stormy to me   answered dick  as he saw several  sophomores eyeing tubbs angrily  it was against the rule of brill for  a freshman to carry a cane      stormy  did you say   repeated the dude in dismay   why   i  ah  thought it very fine  don t you know  perhaps i had better take  an  ah  umbrella instead of this cane      it would be much safer   returned dick significantly      but i  ah  don t see any clouds   went on william philander  gazing  up into the sky      they are coming   cried tom      stand from under   called out sam     and then the  clouds  did come  although not the kind the dude  anticipated  six sophomores came up behind tubbs  and while two caught  him by the arms a third wrenched the gold headed cane from his grasp      hi  hi  stop that  i say   cried william philander in alarm   let me  alone  give me back my cane       you don t get this cane back  freshie   answered one of the  second year students      you must give it to me  why  miss margaret devoe marlow gave me that  cane last summer  when we were at newport  i want        no more cane for you  freshie   was the cry  and then  to tubbs   untold horror  one of the sophomores placed the cane across his knee  as if to break it in two      don t you break that cane  don t you dare to do it   cried the dude   and then he commenced to struggle violently  for the cane was very  dear to him  being a birthday gift from one of his warmest lady  friends  in the scuffle which followed william philander had his  collar and necktie torn from him and his coat was split up the back      say  this is going too far   cried dick  and then he raised his  voice   freshmen to the rescue       this is none of your affair   growled the sophomore who had led the  attack on tubbs      don t break that cane   cried tom   if you do somebody will get a  bloody nose       we ll do as we please   cried several second year students     then tom and sam rushed for the cane and got hold of it  two  sophomores held fast on the other side  and a regular tug of war  ensued  in the meantime other sophomores were making life miserable  for tubbs  they took his hat and used it for a football  and threw the  dude on his back and piled on top of him until he thought his ribs  were going to be stove in      what s the row   the call came from stanley  and he and max appeared   followed by songbird and several others      attack on tubblets   called tom   to the rescue  everybody  save the  cane      and then a crowd of at least twelve students surrounded the cane   hauling and twisting it this way and that  it was a determined but  good natured crowd  the sophomores felt they must break the offending  stick into bits  while the freshmen considered it the part of honor to  save the same bit of wood from destruction     at last sam saw his chance  and with a quick movement he leaped  directly on the shoulders of one of the second year students  as the  fellow went down he caught hold of two of his chums to save himself   this loosened the hold on the cane  and in a twinkling sam  aided by  stanley  had it in his possession  he leaped down and started on a run  for the dormitory      after him  get the cane       don t let him get away with it       nail him  somebody      so the cries rang out  several sophomores tried to head the youngest  rover off  but he was too quick for them  he dodged to the right and  the left  and hurled one boy flat  then he ran around a corner of a  building  mounted the steps to a side door  and disappeared from view      hurrah for sam rover       say  that was as good as a run on the football field       that s the time the sophs got left       hi  where s my cane   howled william philander  gazing around in  perplexity as soon as the second year students let go of him      sam has it   answered tom   and it wasn t broken  either   he added  with pride      but  ah  why did he  ah  run away with it   queried tubbs innocently      to stop the slaughter of the innocents   answered dick   he ll give  it back to you later  but don t try to carry it again   went on dick  in a low voice      just look at me   moaned william philander as he gazed at the  wreck of his outfit   look at this tie  and it cost me a dollar and  seventy five cents       be thankful you weren t killed   answered a sophomore   don t you  know better than to carry a cane       i  ah  fancy i ll carry a cane if i wish   answered tubbs with great  dignity      not around brill   answered several      and  ah  why not       because you re a freshie  that s why  you can wear the  colors  because of the necktie rush  but you can t carry a cane       oh  ah  so that s it   cried william philander  a light breaking in  on him   but why didn t you come up politely and tell me so  instead  of rushing at me like a  ah  like mad bulls  it was very rude  don t  you know       next time we ll send you a scented note by special liveried  messenger   said one of the second year students in disgust      we ll have it on engraved paper  too   added another      thank you  that will be  ah  better   replied william philander  calmly   but look at my suit   he continued  and gave a groan   i  can t  ah  make any afternoon calls to day  and i was going to a pink  tea        wow  a pink tea  boys   yelled one of the boys   wouldn t that rattle  your back teeth       never mind  tubby  the cook will give you a cup of coffee instead    said tom      i should think you d feel blue instead of pink   added spud jackson      sew up the coat with a shoestring  and let it go at that   suggested  max      if you want to paste that collar fast again i ve got a bottle of  glue   said songbird      now  ah  don t you poke fun at me   stormed william philander    haven t i suffered enough already       why  we re not poking fun  we re weeping   said tom  and pretended to  wipe his eyes with his handkerchief      i am so sorry i could eat real doughnuts   said dick      maybe you want to send a substitute to that pink tea   came from  stanley   you might call on professor sharp       or pinkey  the watchman   said max   he ll do it for a quarter   maybe       i  ah  don t want any substitute   growled william philander    i  ah  think you are  ah  very rude  all of you  i am going back to  my room  that is what i am going to do      at this tom began to sing softly        don t be angry  william  darling     wipe the raindrops from your eyes     all your sorrows will be passing    when you re eating christmas pies       you stop that  you mean thing   burst out the dude  and then turning   he almost ran for the dormitory  the laughter of the students ringing  out loudly after him           chapter xvii    a misunderstanding       here s a letter from father  quite an important one  too   said dick  as he joined his brothers in one of the rooms several days later      what about   questioned sam  while tom looked up from a book with  interest      it s about tad sobber and that fortune from treasure isle   answered  dick      what  has that rascal showed up again   exclaimed tom      he has  and according to what father says  he is going to make all  the trouble possible for the stanhopes and the lanings       that s too bad   said sam      i ll read the letter   went on dick  and proceeded to do so  in part  the communication ran as follows      you wrote that you knew about sobber s call upon mrs  stanhope  well   after the girls left for hope seminary  sobber and a lawyer named  martin snodd called upon mr  laning and then upon me  sobber was very  bitter  and he wanted to know all about what had been done with the  treasure  he claims that he and his uncle  who is dead  were robbed of  the boxes  evidently sobber and the lawyer had talked the matter over  carefully  for the latter intimated that sobber might settle the case  if the stanhopes and the lanings would give him seventy five per cent   of the fortune  mr  laning did not wish to go to law  and told sobber  he might be willing to settle for a small amount  say two or three  thousand dollars  but sobber wouldn t listen to this  and went off  declaring he would have it all       since that time martin snodd has been busy  and he has obtained a  temporary injunction against the stanhopes and the lanings  so that  they cannot touch a dollar of the money  which  as you know  is now  in several banks  the matter will now have to await the result of the  case  which will probably be tried in court some months from now       i have learned that sobber has little or no money  and that martin  snodd has taken the case on speculation  sobber to allow him half of  whatever he gets out of it  snodd s reputation is anything but good   so i am afraid he will have a lot of evidence manufactured to order   i have recommended a firm of first class lawyers to mrs  stanhope and  the lanings  and they will  of course  fight the matter to the bitter  end       this is too bad   cried sam after dick had finished   so the fortune  is tied up so they can t spend a cent of what s left       they can t touch a cent until the courts decide who the fortune  really belongs to   answered dick   and if sobber should win  the  stanhopes and the lanings will have to pay back that which they have  already used       oh  how can sobber win   cried tom   father said the stanhope and  laning claims were perfectly legal       true  tom  but you can never tell how a case is going to turn out  in court  if this martin snodd is a shyster he may have all sorts of  evidence cooked up against our friends  sobber would most likely  swear to anything  and so would some of the sailors saved from the   josephine   and then there are some of sid merrick s other relatives   who would try to benefit by the case  they d probably testify in favor  of sobber  for they wouldn t expect anything from mrs  stanhope or the  lanings       but the records of mr  stanhope s business deals ought  to be clear    said sam      they are not as clear as one would wish  so father told me   answered  dick  he gave a long sigh   too bad  and just when we thought the  stanhopes and the lanings could sit down and enjoy all that fortune       i wonder if the girls know of this yet   mused tom      most likely they have had word from home   answered dick      it will make them feel pretty sore   said sam      yes  it would make anybody feel sore   answered the oldest rover    we ll have to drive over and see  the first chance we get      when they met the girls the boys learned that they knew all about the  affair  all were worried  and showed it      this will upset mamma very much   said dora   i am afraid it will put  her in bed       it s too bad  but it can t be helped   said dick      dick  do you think we ought to buy sobber off       no  he doesn t deserve a cent of that money       papa says the case will not come up for a long time  the courts are  so crowded with cases   remarked nellie   he is about as worried as  anybody  for he has already spent several thousand dollars  and if we  lose he won t know how to pay it back       we ll lend him the cash   said tom promptly  and for this nellie gave  him a grateful look     the boys did their best to cheer up the girls  but their efforts were  not entirely successful  all felt that the coming legal contest would  be a bitter one  and that tad sobber and the shyster lawyer who was  aiding him would do all in their power to get possession of the  fortune found on treasure isle     the girls were coming to the football game with sam  and all said they  trusted brill would win the contest      we are all going to carry brill flags   said grace   and i am going  to root  isn t that what you call it   as hard as i can       then we ll be sure to win   cried dick     yet the oldest rover was by no means confident  the brill eleven had  heard that their opponents were in the pink of condition  they had  played three games already  and won all of them  brill had played  against the scrub only  which was hardly a test of what it could do     the day for the contest dawned clear and bright  and early in the  afternoon the visitors from roxley  hope  and other institutions of  learning  as well as from ashton and other towns  commenced to pour  in  they came on foot  in carriages and automobiles  and on bicycles   and soon the grandstand and the bleachers were filled to overflowing   flags and college colors were in evidence everywhere  and so were  horns and rattles     while dick was waiting to catch sight of the carriage containing sam  and the girls from hope he saw another turnout approaching  in it were  mr  sanderson and his daughter minnie      why  how do you do  mr  rover   cried the girl pleasantly      very well   answered dick politely  raising his cap   and how are  you       oh  fine  i made papa drive me over to see the game  it s going to be  something grand  so i ve heard   went on minnie  and then she added    thought you and your brothers were coming to see us       we  er  we haven t had much time   stammered dick  he did not care to  add that when he went to see a young lady it was always dora stanhope   and that tom and sam called only on nellie and grace laning      i ve been expecting you   said the girl with a pretty pout      have dudd flockley and jerry koswell been there since       yes  both of them came once  and flockley came after that  but i  refused to see them  mr  flockley wished to bring me to see this game   but i sent word that i was going with papa       he ought to know enough to stay away by this time   said dick  he  could think of no other remark to make      can i get a seat anywhere   asked minnie  looking anxiously over in  the direction of the grandstand      i think so  wait  i ll look       hold on   put in mr  sanderson   just you take minnie along  mr   rover  i ll go and take care of the hoss  i can stand anywhere and  look on      minnie prepared to spring to the ground  and there was nothing to do  but for dick to assist her  he wondered if sam was coming with dora  and the others  but did not see them  then he led the way through the  crowd to where some seats were reserved      i think you ll be able to see nicely from here   he said      oh  i know i shall   she smiled broadly at him   you are very kind  i  don t know what i should have done if i had been alone  there is such  a jam  oh  i do hope you win   and minnie beamed on dick in a manner  that made him blush  for he saw that several were watching them      i must go now  it is getting late   said dick after a little more  talk  he turned  to see sam  dora and the laning girls only a few  seats away  dora was looking fully at minnie sanderson with wide open  eyes and a flush mounting to her cheeks      oh  so you ve arrived   cried dick cheerily  but his voice had a  catch in it  somehow he felt guilty  he could not tell why      yes  here we are   answered nellie      and what a crowd   added grace  dora said not a word  she had stopped  looking at minnie and her eyes were directed to nothing at all on the  football field      well  dora  are you going to wish me success   asked dick  bound to  say something      oh  i guess all your lady friends will wish you that   was the answer  in a voice that did not seem like dora s at all      why  what s the matter   he asked in a low voice meant only for her  ears      nothing       but there is  dora       you had better go down to the field now  i see the other players are  getting ready       but if you are angry at me        oh  i am not angry  so please leave me alone   and now dora turned  still further away  while something like tears began to spring into  her eyes     dick drew back  for her tone of voice nettled him  he felt he had done  nothing wrong  he did not see that look in her eyes  or he would have  understood how much she was hurt  he turned  nodded pleasantly to  nellie and grace  and hurried from the grandstand      where have you been   asked tom when he appeared in the  dressing room      up on the stand  talking to the girls   was dick s short answer      anything wrong  you look out of sorts       no  nothing is wrong   answered the oldest rover  but he felt that  there was something my much wrong  yet he could not tell tom      i didn t do anything out of the way  i m sure i didn t   dick  murmured to himself as he prepared to go out on the gridiron   any  gentleman would have found a seat for miss sanderson  i suppose dora  saw me talking to her  and now she imagines all sorts of things  it  isn t fair  well  i don t care   and dick whistled to himself  just to  keep up his courage  he did care a great deal     at last he was ready  and he followed tom out on the field  the roxley  team had just come out  and their friends were giving them a royal  welcome      roxley  roxley   they shouted   they are the boys to win       it s brill this time   was the answering rally  and then horns and  rattles added to the din  while banners were waved gaily in the  bracing autumn air     dick looked toward the grandstand  trying to single out dora  instead   his eyes met those of minnie sanderson  and she waved both her banner  and her handkerchief  he answered the salute  and then turned to look  where dora and the lanings were sitting  nellie and grace  as well as  sam  cheered him  but dora took no notice  but she waved her flag at  tom     this last action made dick s heart sink  figuratively speaking  to his  shoes  how could a fellow hope to play and win with his girl cutting  him like that  but then of a sudden he shut his teeth hard      i ll win even if she doesn t care   he told himself   i ll not do it  for her  or myself  i ll do it for the honor of brill            chapter xviii    the great football game      it is not my intention to give all the particulars of that game of  football between brill and roxley  for the reason that i have many  other things to tell about  yet i feel that i must tell something of  that great second half  which nobody who saw it will ever forget     in the first half roxley had the kick off  and they played such a  fierce whirlwind game that before the leather had been on the gridiron  eight minutes they scored a touchdown  then they made another  touchdown  and just before the whistle blew for the end of the first  half one of their players kicked a goal from the field     and brill scored nothing     more than this  the playing was so rough that two of the brill eleven  and one from roxley had to retire from the field     of course the visitors went wild with joy  and shouted themselves  hoarse  they waved their colors  swung their rattles  and tooted  their horns for fully five minutes  while the silence among the  brill contingent was so thick it could be  cut with a knife   as sam  afterward expressed it      it s all over   murmured stanley with a glum look on his face   their  eleven this year are too heavy for us       we can t meet them in mass play  that s certain   was dick s comment    if we are going to gain anything at all it must be by open work       tom rover can take felton s place   came the order from the head of  the team  and tom at once threw off the blanket he had been using and  got into practice with another new man and some others     dick felt sore  physically and mentally  he had been roughly used by  two of the roxley players  and had made a fumble at a critical moment   and all during that heartrending first half dora had not noticed him  at all     the coach did some plain talking to the players while in the  dressing room  and told them of where he thought roxley might be  weak  at the left end      don t mass unless you absolutely have to   were his words of caution    they have the weight  but i don t think they have the wind  keep them  on the jump  i think that is your only chance      when the whistle blew for the second half the brill eleven came out on  the gridiron with a  do or die  look on their faces      now pile it into  em   cried the coach   don t give  em time to think  about it      whether it was this caution  or the very desperateness of the case   it would be hard to say  but true it is that brill went at their  opponents  hammer and tongs  from the very start  they avoided all  wedge work and confined themselves as much as possible to open  playing  more than this  they used a little trick dick had once played  when on the eleven at putnam hall  the ball was passed from right to  left  then to center  and then to left again  and then carried around  the end for a gain of twenty five yards  then it was picked up again   turned back and to the left once more  and forced around the end for  twenty yards more      that s the way to do it   yelled several of the brill supporters      over with it  while you ve got the chance      the ball was forced back by sheer weight of roxley  but only for five  yards  then the brill quarter back got it  sent it over to toms and in  a twinkling tom  nursed  it to where he wanted it and kicked a goal  from the field      hurrah  hurrah  hurrah       that s the way to do it       now  then  for another       by the great julius caesar   cried sam   isn t that fine       oh  it was grand   exclaimed nellie  and she waved her banner  directly at tom  and he waved his hand in return  just then nellie  felt as if she could go and hug him      it certainly was fine   said grace   but it s only one goal  and they  have such a big score   she pouted      never mind  we won t be whitewashed  anyway       it s a pity they didn t have tom in the first half   said dora   although her heart was strangely sore  she nevertheless felt proud of  what tom had accomplished     again the two elevens went at it  and now roxley tried again to force  the center by a rush  but to their surprise brill shifted to the  left  that one weak spot  and got the ball on a fumble by the roxley  half back  there was more quick action by four of the brill players   and when the scrimmage came to an end the leather was found just three  yards from the roxley goal line     and then came that awful struggle  where muscle met muscle in a strain  that was truly terrific  roxley was heavier  but its wind was going  fast  brill held at first  then went ahead  an inch  a foot  a yard      hold  em  hold  em   was the roxley cry  but it was not to be  the  yard became two  and then the leather went over with a rush      a touchdown  a touchdown for brill       now make it a goal   was the cry  and a goal it became  the brill  quarter back doing the kicking     from that moment on the battle waged with a fury seldom seen on any  gridiron  brill  from almost certain defeat  commenced to scent a  victory  and went into the play regardless of physical consequences   tom had his thumb wrenched and dick had his ankle skinned  but neither  gave heed to the hurts  indeed  they never noticed them until the game  was at an end     and then came dick s hour of triumph  how he got the ball from the  burly roxley right guard nobody could exactly tell afterward but get  the ball he did  and rounded two rival players before they knew what  was up  then down the field he sped  with his enemies yelling like  demons behind him  and his friends on the benches encouraging him to  go on  he saw nothing and heard nothing until on the grandstand he  perceived a slender girlish form arise  wave a banner  and fairly  scream      dick  dick  run  run  run       it s dora   he thought   dora sees me  she wants me to win      it was the last bit of inspiration he needed  and as a roxley  full back came thundering up to him he threw the fellow headlong  then  straight as an arrow from a bow he rushed for the goal line  crossed  it  and sank limply down in front of the grandstand      hurrah for dick rover       say  wasn t that a dandy run       those brothers can certainly play       it s brill s game now  roxley is going to pieces      amid a great din the leather was taken down into the field and the  goal was kicked      want to get out of the game   dick was asked as he came down   breathing heavily      no  not unless i m put out   was the gritty answer      you ll not be put out  that was the finest run ever made on this  field      what had been said about roxley going to pieces was  in part  true   several shifts were made in the players  but this did not aid the  eleven  with twelve minutes more to play  brill kept up its winning  streak  and secured another touchdown and goal and then a safety  when  the whistle finally blew the ball was well in roxley s territory      brill wins       say  wasn t that a great game  all roxley the first half and all  brill the second       talk about a team pulling itself together  i never saw anything like  what brill did in the second half       nor i       those two rover boys are winders      so the talk ran on  of course  roxley was keenly disappointed  but it  tried not to show it  and sang songs and cheered its opponents  and  brill cheered the enemy  as is the custom     tom and dick were surrounded by a host of friends  and had to shake  hands over and over again  and had to have their hurts washed and  bound up  both wanted to get to where sam and the girls had been left   but this was impossible for quite a while  and then  much to their  surprise  they found their brother and the others had gone  and minnie  sanderson had departed also      wonder where they went to   questioned tom   i told sam we d be along  as soon as possible      to this dick did not answer  he was thinking deeply  was dora still  angry  in spite of how she had cheered him      there they are   cried tom a few minutes later  as he and dick walked  toward the river  he had seen nellie and grace on a bench in the sun   surrounded by a number of other visitors  he hurried up to them   his brother following more slowly   where are dora and sam   he  questioned  looking around      dora asked to go back to the seminary   answered nellie  and looked  sharply at dick      to the seminary   repeated tom in wonder   why  how s that       she said she had a  headache       is that so  that s too bad  why didn t she wait for dick to take her  over       i  i don t know  tom   nellie lowered her voice  so dick might not  hear   something is wrong between them  i don t know what it is       wrong  why  how can that be  i didn t hear of anything   tom now  spoke in a whisper      well  i am sure something is wrong  they acted queer when dick came  to the grandstand before the game commenced  dora s heart was not in  the game at all  she was ready to go before it was over       by the way  tom  who was that other girl   asked grace pointedly      what other girl       the girl dick was talking to here on the grandstand       oh  that was the farmer s daughter we helped when we first came to  ashton  her name is minnie sanderson  we told you about her       she seems to think a good deal of dick   was nellie s comment      why  you don t mean    tom looked around  expecting to see dick close  by   hello  where did he go   he cried      dick is walking back to the college   said grace      hi  dick   called out tom to his brother   where are you going       up to my room   answered dick      yes  but see here        can t see now  i ll see you later   answered dick  he waved his cap  and bowed   good by  nellie  good by  grace   and then he turned on  his heel and continued on his way to the dormitory building      well  if this doesn t beat the chinese   murmured tom      he must be very angry over something   murmured nellie      i think he might have come and shook hands when he said good by    said grace with a pout      i think so myself   answered tom   say  do you think it s that girl    he went on  in his usual blunt fashion      it must be   answered nellie  who was equally frank on all occasions    i don t know what else it could be       but dick hasn t done anything  i am sure of it  why  i don t think he  has seen her since we stopped at her home that time       well  he seemed very attentive to her here in the stand   said grace    and if you ll remember  he didn t meet us when we arrived  i am sure  dora looked for him      tom gave a long sigh and shrugged his shoulders      this takes the edge off the victory   he murmured   i thought the six  of us would have a jolly time for the rest of the day       it certainly is too bad   answered nellie   but i don t think dora is  to blame       oh  of course a girl will stick up for another girl   retorted tom   bound to say something in his brother s defense      tom rover   cried nellie  and then she showed that she was  displeased     it was quite a while before sam came back from seeing dora to the  seminary  he  too  thought dora was more to blame than dick  and this  did not altogether please grace  as a consequence there was a coldness  all around  and the rest of the afternoon dragged most woefully  dick  did not return  and at last sam and tom saw the laning girls back to  their school      a pretty mess of fish   muttered sam on returning to brill      yes  and where is it going to end   asked tom dolefully  it was the  first time there had been such cold feelings all around           chapter xix    more complications      the football eleven celebrated the victory that evening by bonfires  and by something of a feast  of course tom and dick were present  as  were also sam and a host of others  but it must be confessed that the  rovers did not enjoy themselves      see here  dick   said tom after the festivities were over   what is  this trouble between you and dora       don t ask me  ask her   returned dick shortly   she knows more about  it than i do       she won t say a word   came from sam  she said she didn t feel well   that s all  and i know that wasn t true altogether       was it that minnie sanderson   went on tom      if it was  it wasn t my fault   answered dick      but what did you do   insisted tom  he was bound to get at the bottom  of the affair     thereupon dick was compelled to relate all that had happened  which   in truth  was not much      and is that all   asked sam      yes       i don t see why she should be put out over that   said tom slowly    but then girls are queer  the more you know them the less you  understand them       grace and nellie take dora s part   said sam with a deep sigh   it  has put us all somewhat on the outs       i am sorry to hear that   answered dick  and his tone of voice showed  that he was sincere   but i don t know what i can do   he added  helplessly   i don t want to be on the outs with anybody  but if dora  is bound to turn the cold shoulder to me    he did not finish     following the game with roxley  brill played two other games with a  college from delton and another from speer  the game with the latter  college resulted in a tie  but delton was beaten by brill by a score  of    to     tom and dick played in both games  and won considerable  credit for their work     during these days the boys did not see the girls  nor did they hear  from them  thanksgiving was passed at brill  only a few of the  students going home  among the number to leave were dudd flockley and  jerry koswell  and they did not return until a week later     the dude and his crony  as well as larkspur  were still down upon the  rovers  but for the present they kept quiet  the reason being that  they were behind in their lessons and had to work hard to make up  but  all were watching their chances to do the rover boys some injury on  the quiet     dick  tom and sam got along well in their studies  the only trouble  they had in the classroom was with professor sharp  who made them  toe  the mark  upon every occasion  but they took good care to obey the  rules  so the irascible teacher got no chance to lecture or punish  them     the boys got a number of letters from home  and these brought news  that the law case tad sobber had instituted against the stanhopes and  the lanings was being pushed vigorously  mr  rover wrote that he felt  certain the shyster lawyer sobber had on the case was going to present  a great mass of  evidence   no doubt manufactured for the occasion      it s a shame   cried tom after hearing this   such a lawyer ought to  be in prison       the thing of it is to prove he is doing something wrong   answered  dick   it is one thing to know the truth and quite another to prove it  in court       if the case should be lost the lanings will be poorer than ever    said sam      that is true  sam  i wish we could do something  but i am afraid we  can t      fate seemed bound to make matters worse for the rover boys  on a  clear  cold saturday afternoon in december the three brothers and  songbird went out to look for nuts in the woods near ashton  they had  heard that the seminary girls occasionally visited the woods for that  purpose  and each was secretly hoping to run across dora and the  lanings     it did not take the boys long to reach the woods  and they soon found  a spot where hickory nuts were plentiful  they had brought some bags  along  and were soon hard at work gathering the nuts     while thus occupied they heard a number of girls coming along  at  first they fancied the newcomers might be from the seminary  but soon  saw that they were natives of the place  they were five in number  and  among them was minnie sanderson      why  how do you do   said minnie  coming up with a smile on her face    how strange to meet out here   and then she shook hands with each  of the rovers  and speedily introduced her friends  and the rovers  introduced songbird     minnie was neatly attired in a brown dress  with a brown hat to match   and while she did not look anyway  stunning   she made an attractive  appearance  her friends  too  were pretty  and well dressed  and all  were very jolly      it s a nice bunch  all right   murmured tom to sam   i like their  open hearted way of talking       so do i   answered the youngest rover     the girls joined the boys in gathering nuts  and so spent an enjoyable  hour roaming through the woods  often the rovers and songbird would  knock down the nuts with sticks and stones and leave the girls to  gather what they wanted      we like to have a large quantity of nuts on hand for the winter    said minnie to dick   then  when there is a deep snow on the ground we  can sit before the blazing fire and crack nuts and eat them  you must  come over some time this winter and help   she added      perhaps i will   murmured dick  he had to admit to himself that  minnie was very cordial and that she was by no means bad looking  he  did not wonder why flockley and koswell were so anxious to call upon  her     roaming through the woods caused songbird to become poetic  and while  they rested in the sunshine  and picked some of the nuts that tom and  sam had cracked  he recited some verses composed on the spur of the  moment        hark to the silence all around     the well trained ear doth hear no sound     the birds are silent in their nest     all tired nature is at rest     the brook in silence finds its way    from shadows deep to perfect day     the wind is dead  there is no breeze          to make a fellow cough and sneeze      murmured tom  and gave a loud ker chew  that set all the girls to  laughing      that isn t right   declared songbird half angrily   there is no  sneeze in this poem       oh  excuse me  i only thought i d help you out   answered tom  soberly  and then the would be poet continued        the wind is dead  there is no breeze    to stir the bushes or the trees     full well i know  as here i stand     that solitude commands the land       good  fine  immense  great   cried sam enthusiastically   hurrah for  solitude       why  mr  powell  you are a real poet   said one of the girls gravely   and this pleased songbird greatly      you ll have to write in my autograph album   said another  and the  would be poet readily consented  later he inscribed a poem in the book  three pages long     at last it came time to leave the woods  and the boys walked with  the girls toward the road  as they did this they heard the sound of  wheels      must be a carriage coming   said dick  and stepped into the roadway  to see  followed by the others in the party  a few seconds later a  turnout rumbled into sight  it was the hope seminary carryall  and it  contained half a dozen girls  including dora  nellie and grace      hello  look there   cried tom  and raised his cap  and the other boys  did the same  dora and her cousins looked at the crowd  and their  faces flushed  they bowed rather stiffly  and then the carryall bowled  on its way      why  those are your friends   cried minnie  turning to the rovers    don t you want to speak to them       it s too late now   answered dick  he had a curious sinking sensation  in his heart that he could not explain  he looked at his brothers  and  saw that they  too  were out of sorts     the passing of the carryall put a damper on matters  and the girls  felt it  they talked with the rovers and songbird a few minutes longer  and then turned in one direction while the brill students turned in  another      fine lot of girls   was songbird s comment   very nice  indeed  and  they know how to appreciate poetry  too   he added with satisfaction      oh  yes  they are all right   answered dick carelessly  somehow  he  was now sorry he had gone to the woods after nuts      i am going to call on all of them some time   went on songbird   that  minnie sanderson told me she plays the piano  and sings  i am going to  get her to sing a new song i am writing  it goes like this        excuse me  songbird  not now   said dick   i want to do an extra  lesson   and he hurried off  while sam and tom did the same     two hours later dick ran into william philander tubbs  who had been  down to town in company with stanley      had a lovely time  don t you know   drawled william philander   while  stanley posted some letters and addressed some picture postals i did  up the shops  and what do you think  i found a beautiful new maroon  necktie  and it was only a dollar  same kind they would charge one  seventy five for in the big cities  and i saw a new style of collar   and some patent leather pumps that have bows with loose ends  and        some other time  billy   interrupted dick   i m in a hurry now       oh  i m sorry  but  dick  one other thing  i met miss stanhope and  her cousins       you did   and now dick was willing to listen   where       at one of the stores  they were doing some buying  in company with  those chaps you don t like       the chaps i don t like  you don t mean       dick paused in wonder      i mean that flockley chap and his chums  koswell and larkspur       were miss stanhope and the misses laning with those fellows    demanded the elder rover      they seemed to be  they were buying fruit and candy  and i think  flockley treated to hot chocolate  the girls seemed glad enough to  see me  but i  ah  didn t want to  ah  break in  you know  so i came  away       where did they go after having the chocolate and candy       i don t know  i didn t see them after that   and there the talk came  to an end  for several other students appeared  dick walked off in a  thoughtful mood      deeper and deeper   he told himself  with something like a groan   then he hunted up sam and tom      going with flockley and that crowd   cried tom   not much  i won t  have it   and he commenced to pace the floor      what are you going to do about it   asked sam      call on the girls and talk it over  and you and dick are going with  me       i ll not go   declared dick      neither will i   added sam      yes  you shall  and to night   said tom firmly           chapter xx    days of waiting      eight o clock that evening saw the three rovers on their way to hope  seminary  tom was the leader  and it had taken a good half hour s  arguing on his part to get dick and sam to accompany him      you ll make a fool of yourself  and make fools of us  too   was the  way sam expressed himself      most likely they won t want to see us   was dick s opinion      if they don t want to see us  really and truly  i want to know it    answered tom bluntly   i don t believe in this dodging around the  bush  there is no sense in it   it had angered him to think nellie had  been seen in the company of flockley and his cronies  and he was for   having it out  without delay      well  you ll have to lead the way   said dick   i m not going to make  a call and have dora send down word that she can t see me       she won t do that   said tom   i know her too well       well  you call on nellie first       i m not afraid   retorted tom  he was so  worked up  he was willing  to do almost anything     the nearer the three students got to the seminary the slower they  walked  even tom began to realize that he had undertaken what might  prove a very delicate mission      i think it would have been better to have sent a letter   suggested  sam   let s go back and write it before we go to bed       and put down something in black and white that you d be sorry for  afterward   grumbled dick     at the entrance to the seminary grounds they halted again  but then  tom caught each brother by the arm and marched them up to the front  door and rang the bell     a maid answered their summons and led them to a reception room  a  minute later one of the teachers appeared      why  i thought you young gentlemen knew the young ladies had gone  away   said the teacher after they had mentioned the object of their  visit   they said they were going to send you a note       gone away   echoed dick      yes  the three left for home on the late afternoon train  mrs   stanhope and mrs  laning said it was a matter of business  then you  didn t get their note       we did not   answered tom      that is too bad  i am sure they spoke of sending it  wait  i will ask  parks  our messenger  about it      the teacher left the room  and the rover boys looked speculatively at  each other      they must have been getting ready to leave when tubbs saw them   said  dick      and we never knew they were going   added sam bitterly      the matter of business must refer to that sobber case   said tom   i  don t know what else could take them home       maybe they have lost the case and must give the treasure up   said  sam   in that case  mr  laning would have to take the girls away from  such an expensive place as this      in a few minutes the lady teacher came back      parks says he took three notes  addressed to richard  thomas and  samuel rover  he says he went over to brill this morning with them and  gave them to a man named filbury       filbury  eh   said dick  naming an old man who worked around the  dormitories   well  we didn t get them  and i am very sorry       so am i  mr  rover   said the teacher      do you know how long the young ladies will be gone       they could not tell  they said they would send letters after they  arrived home      this was all the seminary teacher could tell  and a minute later the  rovers said good night and left  all hurried from the grounds in deep  thought      we must find filbury and see what he did with those letters   said  tom  and his brothers agreed with him     when they reached brill they located the man they were after fixing a  light in one of the halls      where are those letters you got for us this morning  filbury   asked  dick sternly      letters   asked the old man  who was rather absent minded   i don t  remember no letters  mr  rover       i mean the three letters which parks of hope seminary gave you for me  and my brothers       oh  them  i remember now  let me see  yes  i got them  and one for  mr  flockley  too  i gave him all the letters  he said he d hand  em  to you   and apparently satisfied  filbury resumed his work on the  light      when was this   demanded sam      about eleven o clock  i hope it s all right  i would have delivered  the letters myself  only i had a lot of work to do       it is not all right  and we are going to look into the matter at  once   said dick  and hurried off with tom and sam at his heels   they went straight to the room occupied by flockley and koswell  and  knocked on the door  there was a stir within  a few whispered words   and then the door was opened      what do you want   asked jerry koswell  flockley was sitting by the  table  reading      flockley  what did you do with those letters you got from filbury for  us   demanded dick  striding into the room      letters   asked the dude carelessly   oh  i put them on the table in  tom and sam s room       when       this morning       they weren t there after dinner   said sam      nor after supper  either   added tom      look here  do you accuse me of stealing your letters   demanded  flockley  rising as if in anger      no  but we want to know where they are   answered tom      i told you what i did with them  i wouldn t have touched the letters   only filbury asked me to do the favor  if they are not on the table  maybe the wind swept them to the floor  did you look       no       then you had better       you might have spoken about them  flockley   said dick coldly   any  other student would have done so       or you could have handed us the letters at lunch   added sam      i am not your hired man   cried dudd flockley   next time i ll not  touch the letters at all   and then he dropped back into his chair and  pretended to read again      if we don t find the letters you ll hear from us again   said dick   and then he and his brothers retired     they entered the room occupied by sam and tom and lit up  the notes  were not on the table      here they are   cried sam  and picked them up from the floor  under  the edge of tom s bed  they looked rather mussed up  and all of the  rovers wondered if flockley had opened and read them      i don t think he d be any too good to do it   muttered tom as he  opened the note addressed to himself     it was from nellie  and rather cool in tone  it said all were  called home on account of the case at court  but did not give any  particulars  at the bottom was mentioned the time of departure from  hope and also from ashton  the notes from dora and grace contained  about the same information  and grace added that she wanted sam to  write to her      if we had had these letters this afternoon we might have gone to hope  instead of nutting   said tom bitterly      they must have expected to see us  either there or at the depot    said sam   otherwise they wouldn t have been so particular about  mentioning the time of departure from both places       yes  i guess they expected to see us  or hear from us   said dick   and breathed a deep sigh      well  they did see us  when we were with miss sanderson and her  friends       what must they have thought  if they imagined we had received the  letters   groaned tom      they thought we cut  em dead   replied sam   isn t this the worst  ever  and all on flockley s account  i d like to punch his nose       i d like to be sure of one thing   said dick  a hard tone stealing  into his voice   did flockley just happen to be in ashton when the  girls got there  or did he open and read these letters and then go on  purpose  with koswell and larkspur       say  that s something to think about   cried tom   if he opened the  letters i d like to make him confess       well  one thing is certain   said dick after the matter had been  talked over for a while   we missed a splendid chance to talk matters  over with the girls  it is too bad   and his face showed his concern      and you didn t even want to go to hope with me   commented tom  with  a humor he could not repress      wish we had gone yesterday   answered sam bluntly  he could read   between the lines  of the note he had received  and knew that grace  wanted to see him just as much as he wanted to see her     sam said he was going to write a letter that night  and finally tom  and dick agreed to do the same      but i shan t write much   said dick   i am not going to put my foot  in it   nevertheless he wrote a letter of four pages  and then added  a postscript of two pages more  and the communications sam and tom  penned were equally long      we ll not trust  em to the college mail   said tom   we can take  em  to the post office when we go to church to morrow   and this was done     after the letters were posted the brothers waited anxiously for  replies  and in the meantime buckled down once more to their studies   it was now well along in december  and one morning they awoke to find  the ground covered with snow      snowballing to day   said tom with a touch of cheerfulness  and he  was right  that day  after class hours  the students snowballed each  other with a will  the freshmen and the sophomores had a regular  pitched battle  which lasted the best part of an hour  all of the  rovers took part in the contest  and it served to make them more  cheerful than they had been for some time      what s the good of moping   said tom   we are bound to hear from the  girls sooner or later   yet  as day after day went by  and no letters  came  he felt as downcast as did his brothers     the boys were to go home for the christmas holidays  and under  ordinary circumstances they would have felt gay over the prospect  but  now it was different      going to send dora a christmas present   asked tom of dick  a few  days before the close of the term      i don t know  are you going to send anything to nellie       yes  if you send something to dora       sam says he is going to send grace a writing outfit and a book of  postage stamps   went on dick      that s what they all need   growled tom   it s a shame  they might at  least have acknowledged our letters      the boys did not know what to do  supposing they sent presents to the  girls  and got them back  they held a meeting in dick s room and asked  songbird s advice      send them the nicest things you can buy   said the would be poet   i  am going to send a young lady a gift  a beautiful autograph album   with a new poem of mine  sixteen verses in length  it s on  the clasp  of a friendly hand   i got the inspiration once when i  er  but never  mind that  it s a dandy poem       who is the album to go to   asked tom indifferently      why  er  minnie sanderson   answered songbird innocently   you see   we have gotten to be very good friends lately            chapter xxi    home for the holidays      the next day the rover boys went down to ashton to see what they could  find in the stores  dick said he wanted to get something nice for his  aunt martha  tom wanted something for his father  and sam said he  thought uncle randolph was deserving of a gift that was worth while     yet when they got into the largest store of which the town boasted  all seemed to gravitate naturally to where the pretty things for the  ladies were displayed      there s a dandy fan   murmured tom   nellie likes fans very much       so does grace   returned sam   say  what are you going to do       what are you going to do  sam       i m going to get one of those fans and send it  along with a box of  bonbons and chocolates   answered the youngest rover boldly   and i m  going to send mrs  laning a pair of kid gloves   he added      then i ll send a fan  too   answered tom   and i ll send mrs  laning  a workbox  i know she d like one      in the meantime dick was looking at some fancy belt buckles and  hatpins  he knew dora liked such things      i ll just take songbird s advice and get the best i can and send  them   he told himself  and he picked out the best buckle he could  find  and likewise a handsome hatpin  and had them put into a fancy  box  along with a fancy christmas card  on which he wrote his name   then he purchased a five pound box of candy at the confectioner s  shop  and tom and sam did the same     this was the start  and now that the ice was broken  and the first  plunge taken  the boys walked around from one store to another   picking up various articles  not alone for the folks at home  but also  for their various friends  and they added a number of other things for  the girls  too      it s no worse to send four things than two   was the way tom  expressed himself      right you are   answered dick  now that they had decided to send the  things they all felt better for it     on the day school closed there was another fall of snow  and the boys  were afraid they would be snowbound  but the train came in  although  rather late  and all piled on board     at oak run  their railroad station  they found jack ness  the rover s  hired man  awaiting them with the big sleigh  into this they tumbled   stowing their dress suit cases in the rear  and then  with a crack  of the whip  they were off over swift river  and through dexter s  corners  on their way to valley brook farm      and how are the folks  jack   asked sam as they drove along  the  sleighbells jingling merrily in the frosty air      fine  master sam  fine   was the hired man s answer      and how have you been       me  oh  i ve been takin  it easy  since master tom quit plaguing me       why  i never plague anybody   murmured tom  with a look of injured  innocence on his round face  he reached out and caught some snow from  a nearby bush   say  jack  what is that on the horse s hind foot   he  went on      where  i don t see nuthin    answered the hired man  and leaned over  the dashboard of the turnout to get a better view  as his head went  forward tom quickly let the snow in his hand fall down the man s neck   inside his collar      hi  hi  wow   spluttered jack ness  straightening up and twisting his  shoulders   say  what did you put that snow down my back for       just to keep you from sweating too much  jack   answered tom with a  grin      at your old tricks again   groaned the hired man   now  i reckon the  house will be turned upside down till you go back to college      when the boys got in sight of the big farm house they set up a ringing  shout that quickly brought their father and their uncle and aunt to  the door  and behind these appeared the ebony face of aleck pop  the  colored man who was now a fixture of the rover household      hello  everybody   cried tom  making a flying leap from the sleigh  the instant it drew up to the piazza   isn t this jolly  though   and  he rushed to his aunt martha and gave her a hug and kiss  and then  shook hands with his father and his uncle randolph dick and sam were  close behind him  and went through a similar performance      my  my  don t squeeze the breath out of me   cried mrs  rover  as she  beamed with delight  you boys are regular bears       glad you got through   said their father   it looks like a heavy  storm       it does my heart good to see you again   said uncle randolph   i  trust you have profited by your stay at brill   he was well educated  himself  and thought knowledge the greatest thing in the world      oh  we did profit  uncle randolph   answered tom with mischief  chewing in his eyes   dick and i helped to win the greatest football  game you ever heard about       tom rover   remonstrated his aunt  while aleck pop doubled up with  mirth and disappeared behind a convenient door      we brought home good reports   said sam   dick stands second in  the class and tom stands fifth  that s not so bad in a class of  twenty two       and sam stands third   put in tom      that is splendid   said anderson rover   i am proud of you       and so am i proud   added randolph rover      you ll all be great men some time   said their aunt martha   but come  into the sitting room and take off your things  supper will be ready  in a little while  but if you want a doughnut beforehand        hurrah for aunt martha s doughnuts   cried sam   i was thinking of  them while riding in the train       well  you shall have all you wish during the holidays   answered his  aunt fondly     they were soon settled down and relating the particulars of some of  the things that had happened at brill  none of the boys cared to tell  of the coldness that had sprung up between themselves and the girls   they simply said they knew the girls had gone home      that was an outrage   said mr  rover with considerable warmth      an outrage   repeated dick doubtfully   what do you mean       perhaps you didn t hear the report that was circulated at hope  seminary concerning them       we heard no report  excepting that they had been called home       somebody circulated a story that they were going to school on money  that did not belong to them  that their folks had confiscated a  fortune belonging to others  grace wrote to her mother that the story  was being whispered about everywhere  and it was making them all  miserable  and that s the main reason for their going home       what a contemptible thing to do   cried tom   who do you suppose is  guilty  tad sobber       i can think of nobody else  he is so angry he would do anything to  injure them and us       and what of the case   asked sam   will it come up in court soon       some time next spring       and what do the lawyers think of our side winning   questioned dick  eagerly      they say it depends largely upon the evidence the other side submits   it is possible that the case may drag on for years       what a shame   murmured dick     it continued to snow all that night and the next day  and christmas  found the family all but snowbound at valley brook      merry christmas   was the cry  early in the morning  and the boys  tumbled out of bed and dressed in a hurry  then they went below  to  find a stack of presents awaiting them  they quickly distributed the  gifts they had brought and then looked at their own  they had almost  everything their hearts could desire     yet each youth felt a pang of disappointment  for among all the gifts  there were none for them from the stanhopes or the lanings      we are out of it   said dick laconically to his brothers      so it appears   answered tom soberly  for once  all the fun was  knocked out of him      well  i am glad i didn t forget them  anyway   said sam bravely  but  he wondered how it was grace could treat him so shabbily     the boys passed the day as best they could in reading and playing  games  and in snowballing each other and jack ness and aleck pop      my  my  but dis am lik old times at putnam hall   said the colored  man  grinning from ear to ear when tom hit him on the head with a  snowball   hab yo  fun while yo  am young  massa tom       that s my motto  aleck   answered tom   have another   and he landed  a snowball on the colored man s shoulder      i move we go down to the post office for mail   said dick toward  evening   we don t know what we may be missing       second the motion   cried tom   the post office it is  if we can get  through       can t no hoss git through these drifts   came from jack ness      we ll hitch up our biggest team and take our time   said dick   we  have got to get down to the post office somehow   he was hoping  desperately that he would find a letter from dora there     when the old folks heard of it they shook their heads doubtfully  but  the boys pleaded so strongly that at last they were allowed to go   they got out a strong cutter and the best pair of horses on the farm   and bundled up well      if you can t make it  drive in at one of the neighbors   said mr   rover on parting      we will   answered dick           chapter xxii    word at last      it was a long  hard drive to dexter s corners  and by the time the  boys arrived there they were chilled through and through and the team  was pretty well winded  they went directly to the postmaster s house   for the office was in a room of the building      i ll see if there are any letters   said the postmaster  and went  off  he returned with a picture postal for mrs  randolph rover and two  advertising circulars for her husband  there were also a newspaper and  a magazine for the boys  father      and is that all   asked dick  his heart sinking      that s all       not worth coming for   muttered tom as they turned away      the mail didn t come in this morning   shouted the postmaster after  them   you ll have to wait for more stuff until the train arrives at  oak run       let us go over to the run and see if we can learn anything about the  trains   said sam  a spark of hope springing up in his breast     they drove over the river  and as they did so they heard the whistle  of a locomotive      something is coming   cried dick      perhaps it s only the night freight   returned tom     when they reached the depot the train was standing there  it was the  morning accommodation  nine hours late  they saw some mail bags thrown  off and also several express boxes and packages     curiosity prompted dick to inspect the express goods  he uttered a cry  of joy      a box for us   he exclaimed   and from cedarville       where   cried tom and sam  and ran forward to look the box over  it  was two feet long and a foot high  and equally deep  and was addressed  to r   t  and s  rover      from the girls  i ll bet a snowball   cried tom joyfully   hurry up  and sign for it and we ll see what it contains      the agent was at hand  for he was the ticket agent and station master  as well  and they soon signed for the box  then they took it to a  secluded corner of the station  and with a borrowed hammer and chisel  pried off the cover     the sight  that met their gaze filled them with pleasure  there were  several packages for each of the boys  from the girls and from mrs   stanhope and mrs  laning  there were some beautiful neckties  some  books  and some diaries for the new year  and a box of fudge made  by the girls  dora had written on the flyleaf of one of the books   wishing dick a merry christmas and a happy new year  and similar  sentiments from nellie and grace appeared in the books for tom and  sam      say  i reckon this was worth coming for   remarked sam      rather   answered dick      wouldn t have missed it for a million dollars   added tom      maybe the mail bag has some letters for us   went on sam  he was  disappointed that no note had accompanied the gifts      we ll take the bags to the office and see   said dick  and this was  done a little later  after the box had been closed and put in the  cutter and carefully covered with a robe  in the bags were found  letters from their old friends  hans mueller and fred garrison  and a  postal from dave kearney  but that was all      well  we mustn t expect too much   said dick   remember  we didn t  send any letters       but we will now  thanking them for all these nice things   said sam  quickly     it was nearly midnight before the boys got home again  and their folks  were much alarmed about them  they were almost exhausted  but very  happy  and they showed their new presents with great pride      they are dear girls   said mrs  rover   it was splendid of them to  remember you this way  and splendid of mrs  stanhope and mrs  laning   too      the next morning was spent in writing letters  it was rather hard at  first to say just what they wanted to  but after they had started the  letters grew and grew  until each was ten pages or more  they told  about meeting minnie sanderson and the other girls by accident  and  about not getting the notes until that night  and dick added the  following to his letter to dora      and now let me tell you something in secret  songbird powell has  developed a very  very strong liking for miss sanderson  the girl tom  and sam and i aided when first we came to brill  he talks about her a  good deal  and took her to a concert at ashton one evening  he said he  was going to give her an autograph album for christmas and write in  it an original poem sixteen verses long  on  the clasp of a friendly  hand   that is pushing matters some  isn t it  we all wish him luck       there  that ought to make her understand how i feel about miss  sanderson   said dick to himself  and then he ended the letter by  stating he hoped they would meet again soon so that they could have a  good long talk     on the day after the letters were mailed the storm cleared away and  the sun came out brightly  the boys went for a long sleigh ride  and  visited some friends living in that vicinity  then they helped to  clear off a pond  and on new year s day went skating      and now back to the grind   said tom with a little sigh      never mind  remember summer will soon be here   answered sam   and  then we can go on a dandy trip somewhere      the next day found them back at brill  this was saturday  and the  school sessions were resumed on monday  they went at their studies  with a will  resolved to get marks that would be  worth while  at the  june examinations  they were asked to join the college basketball  team  but declined  and took regular gymnasium exercise instead  much  to their surprise  dudd flockley was put on the team      i don t think that dude will make good   said tom  and he was right   flockley made some bad errors during the first game played  and was  lectured so severely that he left the team in disgust  and songbird  powell was put in his place  then the team won three games straight   which pleased all the students of brill greatly  minnie sanderson was  at two of the games  and she applauded songbird heartily  the two were  certainly warm friends  dick spoke to minnie  but did not keep himself  long in her company     at last  after waiting much longer than they had expected  the boys  received letters from dora and the lanings  the girls had been on a  visit to some relatives in philadelphia  and had just received the  letters mailed from oak run     the three rovers read those letters with deep interest  they told  about what the girls had been doing  and related the particulars of  the trouble at hope seminary  it was all tad sobber s work  they said   and added that sobber had written that he would not only get the  treasure  but also disgrace them all he possibly could      the rascal    muttered dick when he read this   he ought to be put in  prison      dora s letter to dick was an especially tender epistle  and he read it  several times in secret  he was glad that the misunderstanding between  them was being cleared away  he wished she might be near  so that he  could go and see her      i d take a run to cedarville if it wasn t so far   he told his  brothers      i d go along   answered tom  and sam said the same      perhaps we can run up there during the spring vacation   went on  dick     there was little more snow that winter  but the weather remained  bitterly cold until well into february  the boys had considerable fun  snowballing  and skating on the river  racing on skates was a favorite  amusement  and sam and tom won in a number of contests     one day tom was skating by himself  he was doing some fancy figures   and he did not notice the approach of jerry koswell  who was skating  with a young lady from ashton  tom came around in a circle  and jerry   who was looking at the young lady instead of where he was going   bumped into tom  both of the students went down  tom on top      hi  what do you mean by this   burst out koswell in a rage      what do you mean   retorted tom  getting up      you knocked me down on purpose   howled jerry      it was as much your fault as mine       it wasn t my fault at all  i ve a good mind to punch your face   and  having gotten to his feet  koswell doubled up his fists threateningly     at this the young lady let out a scream      oh  please don t fight   she cried  and then she skated to a distance  and disappeared in a crowd      you keep your distance  koswell   said tom coldly   if you don t       he got no further  for just then koswell let out with his right  fist  the blow landed on tom s shoulder and sent him spinning away a  distance of several feet           chapter xxiii    the springtime of life       a fight  a fight   came from the crowd  and soon tom and koswell were  surrounded by a number of students and some outsiders     the blow from the bully angered tom greatly  and skating forward he  made a pass at koswell  but the latter ducked  and then came back at  tom with a blow that sent the fun loving rover into several students  standing by      say  rover  look out  or jerry koswell will eat you up   said one of  the seniors      koswell is a good scrapper   came from another      i gave him one lesson and i can give him another   answered tom    there  take that      he turned swiftly and rushed at koswell  one blow after another was  delivered with telling accuracy  and koswell went flat on his back on  the ice  when he got up his nose was bleeding      i ll fix you   he roared   come on to shore and take off your  skates       i m willing   answered tom recklessly  he knew fighting was against  the rules of the college  but he was not going to cry quits     the pair moved toward the shore  the crowd still surrounding them   they soon had their skates off      now  jerry  do him up brown   came from larkspur  who was present      give him the thrashing of his life   added flockley  who had come up      he has got to spell able first  and he doesn t know the alphabet well  enough to do it   answered tom      what s up   cried a voice from the rear of the crowd  and dick  appeared  followed by sam      koswell attacked me  and wants to fight  and i am going to  accommodate him   said tom      don t you butt in   growled koswell      i won t   answered dick   but i want to see fair play   he knew it  would be useless to attempt to get tom to give up the fight     without preliminaries the two faced each other  and koswell made a  savage rush at tom  aiming a blow for his face  tom ducked  and landed  on his opponent s chest  then koswell hit tom on the arm and tom came  back at him with one on the chin  then they clinched  went down  and  rolled over and over      stop  you rascal   cried tom suddenly   can t you fight fair       what s up   asked dick  leaping forward      he bit me in the wrist       i  i didn t do anything of the kind   howled jerry koswell      break away  both of you   ordered dick   we ll see into this      tom let go  but koswell continued to hold fast  seeing this  dick  forced the two apart and both scrambled up      see here  this isn t your fight   said larkspur to dick      it will be yours if you don t shut up   answered dick  so sharply  that larkspur shrunk back in alarm      i didn t bite him   grumbled koswell      he did  right here   answered tom positively   look      he pulled up his sleeve and showed his wrist  there in the flesh were  the indentations of a set of teeth      you coward   said sam   you ought to be drummed out of brill       that s worse than using a sandbag   added dick      i  i didn t do it   muttered koswell  he looked around as if he  wanted to slink out of sight      you did   cried tom   and take that for it   and before the brute of  a youth could ward off the blow he received tom s fist in his right  eye  then he got one in the other eye and another in the nose that  made the blood spurt freely  he tried to defend himself  but tom was   fighting mad   and his blows came so rapidly that koswell was knocked  around like a tenpin and sent bumping  first into flockley  then into  larkspur  and then into some bushes  where he lay  panting for breath      now have you had enough   demanded tom  while the crowd marveled at  his quickness and staying powers      i  i    stammered koswell      if you ve had enough  say so   went on tim   if not  i ll give you  some more       i  i m sick   murmured koswell   i was sick this morning when i got  up  i ll  i ll finish this with you some other day       all right  koswell   answered tom coolly   but when you go at it  again  do it fairly  or you ll get the worst of it  remember that       hurrah for tom rover   was the cry from stanley  and the cheer was  taken up on all sides  jerry koswell sneaked away as soon as he could   and flockley and larkspur followed him      he ll have it in for you  tom   said sam as he and his brothers got  away from the crowd   most likely he is mad enough to do anything       oh  he was mad before   declared tom   i am not afraid of him      everybody thought there might be another fight in the near future  but  day after day went by and koswell made no move  nor did he even notice  tom  he kept with flockley and larkspur  and the three were often  noticed consulting together     at last winter was over  and the warm breath of spring filled the air   much to the pleasure of the boys  they got news that dora  nellie and  grace were going to return to hope  regardless of the reports that had  been circulated about them      good  that s what i call pluck   cried dick     they learned when the girls would arrive at ashton  and got permission  to go to town to meet them  it must be confessed that all of them were  a trifle nervous  in spite of the warm letters that had been sent     when the train came in they rushed for the parlor car  and then what a  handshaking and greeting followed all around  everybody was talking at  once  and after the first minute or two there was nothing but smiles  and laughter      i am so sorry that  you know   whispered dick to dora      so am i   she answered   what geese we are  aren t we       well  we won t have any more misunderstandings  will we   he went on   squeezing her hand      never   she declared  and gave him an arch look   and you say  songbird is  is        going with miss sanderson  yes  and they are as thick as two peas   but  dora  i never was  er  very friendly with her  i  i        but you  you talked to her at that football game  dick  and you  didn t meet me when sam        i know  but i had to find her a seat  after she about asked me to  i  wanted to be with you  i did really  dear       who said you could call me dear   and now her eyes were as bright as  stars      i said so  and i m going to  when we are alone  the future mrs  dick  rover deserves it   he went on boldly  but in a very low voice      oh  dick  you re awful   cried dora  and blushed  but somehow she  appeared mightily pleased     the boys drove the girls to the seminary  and by the time the  boarding school was reached all were on the best of terms once more      mamma wanted us to come back   explained dora   she says  even if we  do lose that fortune she wants me to have a better education  and she  will pay the bill for nellie and grace  too       it will make the lanings quite poor  i am afraid  if the fortune is  lost   replied dick gravely      i know it  dick  but we ll have to take what comes       have you heard from sobber or his lawyer lately       nothing since he threatened to disgrace us       you must watch out for him  if he attempts to bother you while you  are here let us know at once       we will       i hope the case in court is decided soon  and in your favor       say  stop   cried tom  as they were turning into the gate at the  seminary      what s up   asked sam  while dick halted the team he was driving      here comes a buggy along the side road  just look who is in it      all turned to look in the direction of the turnout which was  approaching  as it came closer the rover boys recognized it as one  belonging to mr  sanderson  on the front seat sat songbird  driving   with minnie sanderson beside him  on the rear seat was william  philander tubbs  in company with one of minnie s friends  a girl the  rovers had met while nutting      there s a happy crowd   cried tom after they had passed and bowed and  smiled      no happier than we are   said dick as he looked meaningly at dora      you are right  dick   she answered very earnestly           chapter xxiv    at the haunted house       boys  i ve got a proposition to make   said dick  one friday  afternoon  as he and his brothers  with songbird and stanley  were  strolling along the river bank      all right  we ll accept it for twenty five cents on the dollar    returned tom gaily      what is it  dick   asked songbird      do you remember the haunted house at rushville  the place mr   sanderson called the jamison home   asked dick of his brothers      sure   returned sam and tom promptly      well  i propose we visit that house to morrow and investigate the  ghosts  if there are any       just the thing   cried sam      i ve heard of that place   said stanley   i am willing to go if the  rest are       if i go as far as rushville i might as well go on to the sanderson  home   said songbird  who could not get minnie out of his mind      well  we ll leave you off  after we have interviewed the ghosts    answered dick with a laugh      do you believe in ghosts   asked stanley with a faint smile      no  do you       hardly  although i have heard some queer stories  my aunt used to  think she had seen ghosts       she was mistaken   said tom   there are no real ghosts       say  tom  how could a ghost be real and still be a ghost   asked  songbird and this question brought forth a general laugh     the boys sat down on a bench in the warm sunshine to discuss the  proposed visit to the deserted jamison place  and it was arranged that  they should drive to the spot in a two seated carriage  then  while  the rovers and stanley investigated to their hearts  content  songbird  was to drive on to the sanderson home for a brief visit      but  mind  you are not to stay too long   said dick   an hour is the  limit       i ll make it an hour by the watch   answered the would be poet   say   i just thought of something   he went on  and murmured softly        to morrow  ere the hour is late     we shall go forth to investigate         the jamison ghost        shall be our host     we trust we ll meet a kindly fate       that s as cheerful as a funeral dirge   cried tom      we don t want to meet any kind of a fate   added sam   we want to  have some fun      while the boys were discussing the proposed trip to rushville they did  not notice that larkspur was close at hand  taking in much that was  said  presently larkspur sauntered off and hunted up jerry koswell      the rovers are going off to morrow   he said   where do you suppose  they are going       i am not good at guessing riddles   answered koswell rather sourly   he hated to hear the rover name mentioned  since it made him think of  his defeat at tom s hands      they are going to the old jamison place at rushville       well  what of it       i was thinking   answered larkspur meaningly   you said you would  like to square up with the rovers  and with tom especially       so i would  show me how it can be done and i ll go at it in jig  time   and now koswell was all attention      i happen to know that tom rover and professor sharp are on the outs  again   said larkspur   the professor wouldn t like anything better  than to catch him doing something against the rules       well  what do you propose  anyway   demanded jerry koswell      come up to the room and i ll tell you   answered larkspur  and then  the two hurried off and  joined by dudd flockley  hatched out a scheme  to get the rovers into dire trouble with the college authorities  they  had a number of preparations to make  and paid a hurried visit to  ashton and several other places  flockley hiring a runabout for that  purpose     saturday proved clear and warm  and the rovers and their friends  started directly after lunch for rushville in a two seated carriage   hired from a liveryman of ashton  as they did not wish to excite any  curiosity  they told tubbs and max that they were going out merely for  a long ride      going to call on miss stanhope and the misses laning  i suppose    said william philander      no  they have some lessons to make up to day   answered dick  and  this was true  otherwise the rovers might not have been so willing to  spend their time at the haunted house     no sooner had the rovers and their two friends driven away from brill  than an automobile dashed up on the side road  and flockley  koswell  and larkspur climbed in  the automobile kept to the side road until  the rovers turnout was passed  then took to the main highway  passing  the upper end of ashton      here is where you can leave us   said koswell to the chauffeur   i ll  see to it that the machine comes back safely       you are sure about being able to run it   asked the man      of course  i ran a big six cylinder at home       very well  then  this is a fine car  and there would be trouble with  the boss if anything happened to it       nothing is going to happen  so don t worry   answered koswell coolly   then the chauffeur left  and the automobile dashed on its way in the  direction of rushville     as the rovers and their chums were out purely for pleasure  they  took their time in driving to rushville  going there by way of hope  seminary  they thought they might catch sight of dora and the lanings   but were disappointed      too bad that they have got to grind away on such a fine day as this    said dick      well  such is life   returned sam   one good thing  schooldays won t  last forever       just wait till the summer vacation comes   cried tom   i m going to  have the best time anybody ever heard about       what doing   questioned stanley      oh  i don t know yet      they took their time climbing the long hill leading to the haunted  house  and it was just three o clock when they came in sight of the  dilapidated structure  almost hidden in the tangle of trees and  underbrush      now  songbird  you ve got to be back here by four  or half after  at  the latest   said dick as he and his brothers and stanley got out   no  spooning with minnie till six       huh  i don t spoon   grumbled the would be poet   i am  er  only  going to show her some new verses i wrote  they are entitled        keep them for minnie   cried sam   and remember what dick said  we  are not going to hang around here after dark       scared already   asked songbird      no  but enough of this place is enough  that s all       i ll be back  don t worry   said songbird  and away he drove at a  swift gait  leaving the rovers and stanley in the roadway in front of  the house said to be haunted     it was certainly a lonely spot  no other house being in sight  for  rushville lay under the brow of a hill  the boys stood still and  listened  not a sound broke the stillness that surrounded the deserted  house      it sure is a ghostlike place   remarked stanley   i shouldn t care to  come here at midnight       oh  that wouldn t make any difference  if you had a light   answered  dick  the thought of a ghost had never bothered him very much     boldly the four boys entered what had once been a fine garden  the  pathway was now overrun with weeds and bushes  and they had to pick  their way with care  then they ascended the piazza  the flooring of  which was much decayed      look out that you don t fall through somewhere  and break a leg    cautioned tom   this is worse than it looks from the outside       wait till we get inside   said sam   glad we brought a lantern   for  a light had been taken along at the last minute     they pushed open the front door and entered the broad hall  as they  did so they heard a noise at the rear of the place      what was that   asked stanley nervously      sounded like a door closing   answered dick      hello   called out tom   is any one here      to this call there was no answer  nor was the noise they had heard  repeated      come on   said dick bravely   i am going to walk right through the  house  room by room  from top to bottom       and we ll all go along   said tom and sam      well  i am with you   came from stanley  but he plainly showed that  he did not relish what was before him           chapter xxv    in the hands of the enemy      the first room the boys entered was the parlor  it was totally dark   the blinds of the windows being tightly closed  it was full of  cobwebs  which brushed their cheeks as they passed along      certainly this was a fine mansion in its day   said dick  as he threw  the rays of the lantern around   but it is utterly worthless now   he  added as he gazed at the fallen ceilings and rotted woodwork      i fancy the ghosts are nothing but rats and bats   said tom   come  on   he continued   it s damp enough to give one the rheumatism      from the parlor they passed to a sitting room  here there was a huge  open fireplace  filled with ashes and cobwebs  as they entered the  room they heard a rushing noise in the chimney      what s that   cried stanley anxiously      birds   answered dick   i suppose they have made their home in the  chimney  since it is not used for fires      in a corner of the sitting room was an old table  and on it several  musty books  the boys looked the books over  but found little to  interest them  as relics the volumes were of no value      come on to the dining room   said tom   maybe we ll find something  good to eat       ugh  i don t want anything here   answered stanley with a shudder      wouldn t you like a piece of ghost pie  or some specter doughnuts    went on tom  who was bound to have his fun      nothing  thank you  tom      the dining room of the house was in a wing  and to get to it they had  to pass through a pair of folding doors which were all but closed  as  they did so all heard a peculiar rustling sound  but from whence it  came they could not tell      what was that   asked sam      i don t know   answered his oldest brother      say  this room looks as if it had been used lately   cried tom  as  the rays of the lantern illuminated the apartment   why  it s quite  homelike       maybe some tramps have had their headquarters here   said dick   it  would be just like them to single out a spot like this       yes  provided they weren t afraid of ghosts   came from stanley      tramps aren t usually afraid of anything but work   answered tom  dryly   but this is queer  isn t it   he added  as he picked up  an empty cigar box   somebody must smoke good cigars  these were  imported       here is an empty liquor flask   said stanley      and here are some empty wine bottles   added sam      and here are some decks of playing cards   put in dick   yes  some  persons have certainly used this as a hangout       what is this in the fireplace   asked tom as he pointed to something  smoking there      it certainly has a vile smell   exclaimed stanley  making a wry face      that shows somebody has been here recently   was dick s comment   we  had better be on guard if they are tramps       i can t stand that smell   said tom   i am going to get out      the stuff in the fireplace  whatever it was  now burned up more  brightly  it gave off a peculiar vapor that made the boys dizzy     tom turned to a door that led to the kitchen of the house  the door  was shut  and he tried in vain to open it  the others were behind him  and they  too  tried to open the barrier      must be locked from the other side   said tom   come on out the way  we came in  gracious  isn t that awful stuff that is burning   he  added  for the vapor now filled the room completely     in sudden alarm the four boys turned back toward the folding  doors through which they had entered the dining room  to their  consternation  the doors were tightly shut      who shut these   asked dick as he tried to open one of the doors      i didn t   said sam      neither did i   added tom      nobody touched the doors   ejaculated stanley   it must be some of  the ghost s work       nonsense   answered dick sharply   somebody shut the doors  and  locked  em   he added after trying both   hi  you   he called   open  these doors  and be quick about it       thou fool  to come here   exclaimed a hollow voice from the other  side of the doors      it s the ghost  i said it was   said stanley      it s somebody fooling us   answered tom   open the door  or we ll  smash it down   he added in a loud voice     instead of a reply there came a weird groan and then the rattle of  some heavy chains  stanley turned pale and began to tremble  but the  rovers were not much impressed      we don t believe in ghosts  so you might as well let us out   cried  dick   that stuff you set on fire is smothering us      at this there was a murmur from the next room  but what was said the  prisoners did not know      come on  let us get out of a window   cried tom  his head was  commencing to swim  and he could hardly see      tha  that s it   murmured sam   say  i m  i m  going    he did not  finish  but sank to the floor in a heap      sam has been overcome   cried dick in horror      oh  if only we hadn t come here   groaned stanley   i  the  window  i  am  smothering   he took another step forward and then  fell  dick tried to pick him up  but went down also  with his brain in  a whirl and strange lights flashing before his closed eyes     tom was the last to be overcome  he reached a window  only to find it  tightly locked  he smashed the glass  but could not open the blinds   then he went down  but before he closed his eyes he saw the door to  the kitchen open and several masked faces appeared  he tried to  say something  but the words would not come  and then all became a  terrible dark blank around him     for about half a minute after tom went down nothing was done  then the  door to the kitchen was thrown wide open and four figures appeared   all wore sheets and masks      you are sure it won t kill any of them  parwick   asked a voice that  sounded like jerry koswell s  and which was far from steady      yes  i m sure   answered the voice of a stranger   but we don t want  to leave them in this room too long  take  em below       if we get found out    said another  and one could readily recognize  flockley s voice      we won t get found out   put in a fourth person  it was larkspur    come ahead  and don t waste time here      with great haste the masked ones picked up the three rovers and  stanley and dragged them into the kitchen of the old house  then one  after another the unconscious ones were taken down into a dark and  musty cellar and placed on some straw      now to fix up the evidence   cried koswell   we must be quick  or it  may be too late      for all of a quarter of an hour the three rover boys and stanley  browne lay where they had been placed on the moldy straw  they  breathed with difficulty  for the strange vapor still exercised its  influence on their lungs     at last sam stirred and opened his eyes      wha  what s the matter with me   he murmured  and then sat up     he could see next to nothing  for the cellar was dark  his head ached  keenly  and he could not collect his senses  he also felt somewhat  sick at the stomach      dick  tom   he called   where are you      there was no reply  but presently he heard somebody stir      don t  don t kill me   murmured stanley   take the ghosts away       stanley   called sam   whe  where are we       who  who is tha  that   stammered stanley  sitting up      it is i  sam       whe  where are we  sam       i  i don t know       my head is go  going around like  like a top       so is mine  tom  dick       is that you  sam   came faintly from the elder rover as he opened his  eyes      yes  where is tom       here  i guess  beside me   dick shook his brother   tom  tom  wake  up   he cried  but tom continued to lay quiet with his eyes tightly  closed     sam was feeling in his pocket for a matchbox  and presently he brought  the article forth and made a light  he was still so dizzy he could  scarcely see about him  stanley had fallen back again  gasping for  breath     by the dim light afforded by the match the two brothers looked at tom   he was gasping in a strange  unnatural fashion      i believe he is choking to death   said dick hoarsely   air  he must  have air   he arose unsteadily to his feet   bring him here      and he made for a closed cellar window with all the strength he could  command           chapter xxvi    the evidence against them      fortunately a loose brick lay handy and with this dick smashed out the  panes of glass in the cellar window  another window was opposite   and this he likewise demolished  at once a current of pure air swept  through the place      hold him up to the window   said dick as he staggered around  and he  and sam raised tom up as best they could      if we could only get outside   mumbled sam  his head was aching worse  than ever      i ll see what i can do   answered his oldest brother  and stumbled up  the narrow stairs  to his joy  the door above leading to the kitchen  of the house was unfastened     not without great labor did the two brothers carry tom to the floor  above  then they went after stanley  who was conscious  but too weak  to walk  as they stumbled around they sent several empty liquor  bottles spinning across the floor  and one was smashed into pieces      i wish i knew how to revive him   said dick as he and sam placed tom  near the open doorway   wonder if there is any water handy       oh  my poor head   came from stanley   i feel as if i had been  drinking for a month       wonder what it was   murmured sam   i  i can t make it out at all       nor i   added dick   but come  we must do what we can for tom   and  he commenced to loosen his unconscious brother s tie and collar     suddenly a form darkened the outer doorway of the kitchen  and to the  surprise of the boys professor abner sharp showed himself  he was  accompanied by professor blackie      ha  so we have caught you  have we   cried professor sharp  in tones  of evident satisfaction   nice doings  these  for students of brill   aren t you ashamed of yourselves   and he glared maliciously at the  rovers and stanley browne      oh  professor  can you  er  help us   murmured stanley   we  er  are  in a lot of trouble       so i see   answered abner sharp chillily   nice doings  i declare   don t you think so   he added to the other professor      it is too bad   murmured professor blackie   i thought them all  rather nice lads      dick s head was still dizzy  so he could not catch the import of the  professor s words  he continued to work over tom  who just then opened  his eyes      gi  give me a  a drink   murmured poor tom  his throat seemed to be  on fire      not another drop   shouted professor sharp   not one  this is  disgraceful  look at what they have been drinking already   and he  pointed to the bottles scattered around      say  what s the matter with you   asked sam  sleepily and angrily  he  was doing his best to pull his wits together  and thus overcome the  effects of the strange vapor      there is nothing the matter with me   roared professor sharp  the  matter is with you  rover  you have been drinking too much       me  drinking   stammered sam   no  sir       rover  you may as well admit it   came from professor blackie   it is  a sad state of affairs       but i haven t been drinking       we know better  look at the evidence   roared abner sharp  pointing  to the bottles   why  your very clothing smells of rum   he added   smelling of dick s shoulder      sam has told you the truth  we haven t been drinking   said dick      rover  it would be better if you did not add falsehoods to your other  shortcomings   said professor blackie  he was usually a very mild man   and had little to say outside of the classroom      you are mistaken   murmured dick  it was all he could say  for he was  still too bewildered to make a clear note of what was going on      this one seems to be the worst of all   said abner sharp  turning to  tom   he must have drunk more than the others       he will have to sleep it off   answered professor blackie   too bad   too bad  why will young men do such things   and he shook his head  sorrowfully      i believe what the note said  this has been a regular hangout for the  rovers and their chums   said professor sharp severely   it is high  time it was broken up       yes yes   answered the other instructor how shall we  er  get them  back to brill       i ll see about that  they must have some sort of a carriage here  or  maybe somebody was going to call for them       shall i take a look around       if you will      professor blackie looked around the house and grounds and then went  through the tangle of a garden to the roadway  he espied songbird  coming along  driving the team rapidly and singing to himself   songbird had passed an all too short hour with minnie sanderson      stop  powell   cried the professor      i was going to  sir   answered the would be poet cheerily   how is  this  professor blackie  did you come to hunt for the ghost  too       ghost  i came for no ghosts  since there are no ghosts   was the  quiet answer   were you to stop here       yes  sir  to pick up the three rovers and stanley browne  they must  be somewhere about  they came to explore the old house and to settle  this ghost story       i think they came more for spirits than for ghosts   answered  professor blackie dryly   then you know all about it  eh       why  yes       then you knew they came here to drink and to carouse generally   went  on the instructor  and his voice grew stern      drink  carouse  what are you talking about   gasped songbird   the  rovers don t drink at all  and stanley browne drinks very little       of course you wish to shield them  but it will do little good   powell  professor sharp received word of what was going on  and he  asked me to accompany him here  we have seen a sad sight  what doctor  wallington will say when he hears of it  i cannot tell  i am afraid   however  that he will deal severely with the offenders       professor blackie  what you say is a riddle to me   answered  songbird   i don t understand you at all       then come with me  and perhaps you will understand   was the  instructor s reply  and he led the way to the rear of the deserted  house     all of the students and professor sharp were now outside  on or near  the back porch  tom had recovered his senses  and sam had obtained for  him a drink of water from an old well  much to the astonishment of the  students  the professor had caught sight of a liquor flask in tom s  pocket  and had snatched it away      here is evidence you cannot deny   cried abner sharp in triumph   all  but empty  too   he added  after shaking the flask and smelling of it      how did that  that get in m  my pocket   mumbled poor tom  he was  still hazy in his mind      you probably know better than anybody else   retorted professor  sharp   and you can tell  too  where the liquor went to   he continued  with a sneer      you re a  a  contemptible old sneak   cried tom wrathfully   and if i  didn t feel so  so dizzy i d knock you down       tom   cried dick warningly  he was growing a little clearer in his  mind  and could see that a terrible mistake had been made      you ll not knock anybody down  you young villain   roared abner sharp  in a rage   i ll teach you to come here and drink and carouse  and  bring disgrace upon the fair name of brill college  i ll have you  dismissed and sent home in disgrace       you re making a mistake    began dick      no  there is no mistake  of course you wish to hide the truth  and  smooth matters over  but it won t go with me  nor with professor  blackie  either   stormed professor sharp   we know what we see and  what we smell  you young fellows are a disgrace to brill  and the  sooner everybody knows it  the better  now  then  march to the  roadway  every one of you  and no more back talk       but  sir    began stanley in dismay      not another word   cried abner sharp   if you have anything more to  tell  you may tell it to doctor wallington          chapter xxvii    in disgrace      still dizzy from the effects of the strange vapor  the students were  driven rapidly over the country roads in the direction of brill  college  the fresh air served to make them feel a little better  but  all were far from clear headed when ushered into the presence of  doctor wallington      we have brought them back with us  sir   said professor sharp  stiffly     the president of the college gazed keenly at the rovers and stanley   they looked at him in return  but blinked and swayed as they did so      i will listen to the story   said doctor wallington  turning to the  two instructors  and his voice had a hard tone to it that did not  augur well for the students     thereupon professor sharp told how he had received an anonymous note  stating that the rovers and some others were going off to the old  jamison house to drink and gamble  and that it was thought they were  going to take some innocent outsider with them  to fleece him of his  money  on receiving the note abner sharp had called professor blackie  into consultation with him  and had gone off  after leaving word for  the doctor about what they proposed to do      we found them  the three rovers and stanley browne  in a beastly  state   continued professor sharp   truly beastly state  with empty  liquor bottles and flasks strewn around  and thomas rover had a flask  in his pocket  which i took from him   the instructor placed the  flask on the president s desk   there were also cigar butts scattered  around  and some packs of playing cards       where was powell       he had dropped the others off at the old house and gone on to visit  some folks named sanderson  he came back later       had he been drinking  too       i do not think so   answered professor blackie     during this talk dick and his brothers and stanley stared somewhat  vacantly at the president and the professors  the students wanted to  speak several times  but doctor wallington waved them to be silent      i will hear what you have to say after professor sharp and professor  blackie have finished   said the head of the college     he asked the instructors a great number of questions  and then turned  to dick  as the oldest of the boys      now  then  what have you to say about your disgraceful conduct   he  demanded severely   or perhaps it would be as well to postpone further  conversation until you are in a fit condition to tell a straight  story   the doctor was sarcastic as well as severe      i  i am not well  sir   said dick in a low voice   none of us are   but it was not liquor that did it  it was the vapor       vapor   queried doctor wallington in perplexity      yes  sir       what do you suppose he means   and now the master of the college  turned to abner sharp      when we found them in such a sad state they tried to excuse  themselves by stating that a strange vapor had made them sick   was  the instructor s reply   but we could not trace any such vapor  i feel  sure it is merely an excuse       you ought to have your head punched   growled tom  he was still sick   and the sickness made him reckless      rover  how dare you   exclaimed doctor wallington severely      i don t care  he is down on us  me especially  and he wants to put us  in disgrace  he s a miserable sneak  that s what he is       you are evidently in no condition to tell your story  and your  companions are little better off   went on the head of the college  he  turned to the two professors   you may take them up to rooms    and      mr  blackie  i will confer with you further  mr  sharp      there was no help for it  and with their heads still in a whirl  the  rovers and stanley were taken to two rooms not used by any of the  other students  the rooms were in an angle of the building  away  from all others  they had a small hallway of their own  with a door  shutting it off from the main hall     professor blackie marched the boys into the rooms  and saw to it that  they had a pitcher of fresh drinking water      you will have to remain here until doctor wallington sends for you    said the instructor  and walked out of the room  the boys heard him  pass through the little hall and close and lock the door to the main  hall      prisoners  what do you think of that   cried sam      it is carrying matters with a high hand   answered dick  he placed a  hand on his forehead   how my head aches       same here   answered stanley   i am going to rest   he added  and  threw himself on one of the beds     the others were glad to rest  also  and soon all were occupying the  beds the connecting rooms contained  they left the windows wide open   so that they might get all the fresh air possible  strange to say   each was soon in a profound slumber     while they were sleeping they did not know that professor sharp came  in to see if they wanted any supper  seeing them sleeping so soundly   he notified doctor wallington      do not disturb them   said the president of brill   sleep will do  them more good than anything  i doubt if they care to eat   and he  heaved a sigh as he thought of the problem before him  he liked the  rovers and stanley browne  but according to what he had seen and been  told  some of the strictest rules of brill had been violated  and it  would be impossible for him to pass the affair by or mete out ordinary  punishment      i am afraid i shall have to dismiss them   he told himself   too  bad      in some manner the story leaked out  and by sunday noon all the  students at brill knew that the rovers and stanley were in disgrace   and in danger of dismissal  a few sided with the boys  but the  majority shook their heads      they had no business to go off on such a lark   said one of the  seniors   it s a disgrace to the whole college  if they are sent home  it will serve them right      koswell and larkspur were in high glee over the success of their plot   and when alone winked at each other and poked each other in the ribs      they ll get what s coming to  em this trip   said bart larkspur with  a chuckle   they ll be lucky if they are not sent home       and we ll rub it in  too   added koswell   you know how those rovers  are dead stuck on those girls at hope       sure       well  i ll fix it so those girls hear all about this affair       good   cried larkspur   that will be the bitterest dose of all       say   put in dudd flockley nervously   you don t suppose there is any  danger of our being found out       not the slightest   answered koswell   i saw to it that all our  tracks were covered       but that fellow parwick  are you certain he can be trusted       yes  but we have got to pay him for his trouble  i promised him  twenty dollars  i ll give him half and you can give him the other  half   answered koswell  he knew larkspur had no spending money      oh  i m willing to pay him his price   said the dudish student   but  i want to be dead certain that he will keep his mouth shut       i ll make him do that   returned jerry koswell         chapter xxviii    dark days      the rovers and stanley browne were kept in the rooms until monday  morning  during that time their meals were sent to them  and professor  sharp came to see them twice      doctor wallington will dispose of your case on monday   said the  instructor      i think we should have had a doctor   said dick   all of us were  sick  and needed medical attention       nonsense   cried abner sharp   you have sobered up  and that was all  that was needed      this assertion led to a war of words  and tom came close to whacking  the unreasonable teacher over the head with the water pitcher  as a  consequence  abner sharp ran out of the room in fear and reported to  the head of the institution that he had been assaulted     on monday morning the four boys were told to go down and report at the  president s office previous to this they had held a  council of war    as sam expressed it  and made dick their spokesman      now  then  as you appear to be sober  i will listen to your story    said doctor wallington  he was the only other person present   and  remember   he added sharply   i want nothing but the truth  you cannot  hope for any leniency on my part unless you tell me everything       that is what we propose to do  sir   answered dick  looking the  doctor full in the eyes   my brothers and stanley have asked me to do  the talking for all of us  shall i tell my story now       yes      thereupon dick told his tale from beginning to end  very much as  i have set it down here  he  of course  could tell nothing of the  actions of koswell and his crowd  for he had been unconscious most of  the time      certainly a remarkable story   mused doctor wallington  when the  oldest rover had finished   and you mean to say you did not drink any  of the liquor       not a drop  sir  and neither did the others       and this vapor  what was it  and how do you account for it   the  doctor s tones were very sceptical      i can t account for it  excepting by thinking it was part of a plot  against us       hum   the doctor turned to stanley   have you anything to add to  rover s story       nothing  sir  excepting that it is absolutely true  doctor  wellington      after this the boys were questioned for the best part of an hour  but  without shaking their testimony in the least  then songbird was called  in  and he told what he knew      if your story is true  it is a most extraordinary occurrence   said  the head of brill at last   but i must confess that i can scarcely  credit such a tale  however  i will  for the time being  give you the  benefit of the doubt  and in the meantime make some investigations on  my own account  if i find you have not told the truth i shall dismiss  you from the college  do you understand that      to this the students bowed      one thing more  all of you may return to your classes but thomas  rover  he has an extra charge against him  that of assaulting  professor sharp  thomas rover  you will remain here  the rest of you  can go      with strange feelings in their hearts dick  sam and stanley   accompanied by songbird  left the office  they had been heard  but had  not been believed      we may be dismissed from here  after all   said sam bitterly      what a shame   cried songbird   oh  if you could only find out who  did it  and expose them      the boys went back to their classes with heavy hearts  they saw a  number of the other students looking at them questioningly     jerry koswell saw them return  and was much astonished  had his plot  to put them in disgrace miscarried  after all  larkspur  too  was  perplexed  flockley was a bit relieved  and half hoped the whole  matter would blow over and nothing more be heard of it     the day went by  and the other lads did not see tom  but they saw him  in the evening  just before supper      well  how did you make out   asked dick eagerly      got a vacation   was tom s laconic answer      dismissed   asked the others in concert      no  suspended until doctor wallington can investigate the whole  matter more thoroughly  he wanted me to apologize to sharp  and i said  flatly that i wouldn t do it  because i hadn t anything to apologize  for  he got mad at first  and threatened me with instant dismissal   then i warmed up  and said i was innocent of all wrongdoing  and  perhaps i d be able to prove it some day  and if so  and i was  dismissed  i d sue the college for loss of reputation  that brought  matters to a head  and i guess the doctor saw i was in deadly earnest   he told me i could consider myself suspended for two weeks  or until  he could get to the bottom of the affair  so i ve got a holiday       i m glad you didn t apologize to sharp   said sam      what are you going to do with yourself  go home   asked dick      no  i am going to move to ashton  and then try to get to the bottom  of this matter       the doctor will send a letter home       so will i  and you must do the same  i think father will believe us      tom left that night  and established himself at the leading hotel in  ashton     news travels swiftly  and koswell and his cohorts took care that the  girls at hope should hear the story about the rovers and stanley  and their supposed disgraceful doings  dora  nellie and grace could  scarcely believe their ears when they heard it      this is awful   murmured dora  and the tears came to her eyes      i don t believe one word of it   cried nellie with spirit      but tom has been suspended   said grace   and think of poor sam and  dick   and her heart sank like lead within her bosom      i am going to send dick a note right away   said dora   i cannot bear  this suspense       but you don t think dick is guilty  do you   asked nellie      no  but  but the disgrace  it is terrible   and now dora burst out  crying in earnest     the note from dora reached dick the following day  in the afternoon  mail  it was short  but to the point  reading as follows      dear dick  we have just heard something awful about you and tom and  sam  tell us what it means  of course we don t believe you have done  anything wrong      yours      dora      this note disturbed dick and sam greatly  for they could understand  how the evil report concerning them had been circulated at hope  seminary  and how the girls had suffered in consequence      i am glad they think we are innocent   said sam      they couldn t do anything else  knowing us as they do   returned his  brother  and then he sent a note back stating that the reports were  all falsehoods  and asking them to meet tom and themselves on the  following saturday at ashton      perhaps tom will have something to report by that time   said dick     the time to saturday dragged miserably  the boys could not set their  minds on their lessons  and as a consequence got some poor marks  for  this professor blackie gave them a lecture      you ought to show your appreciation of what doctor wellington has  done in your case   said the instructor      we can t settle down to lessons with this cloud hanging over us    answered dick frankly   it has got to be cleared away  or    he did  not finish      or what  rover       or i m afraid we ll have to leave  even if we are not dismissed   was  the slow answer  and dick breathed a deep sigh           chapter xxix    what the girls discovered      the rover boys sent letters to their father  and on saturday morning  came replies from mr  rover  he said he was both surprised and shocked  at what had occurred  and added that if they needed his aid he would  come on at once  he showed that he believed them innocent  for which  they were thankful      here is more news   said dick   the case of tad sobber against the  stanhopes and the lanings comes up in court next tuesday  that is   they are going to argue the question of the injunction on that day       that will make mrs  stanhope and mrs  laning very anxious       yes  and the girls  too  sam       well  we are anxious  too  oh  i do hope our side wins   cried sam  wistfully   it would set me wild to see tad sobber get all that  money      dick and sam were to meet tom in ashton at three o clock  and all  hoped that the girls would come later  stanley could not go  for he  had a latin composition to write     when the rovers reached the hotel in ashton they found tom impatiently  awaiting them by the look on his face they knew he had something to  tell      come up to my room   he said  and led the way to the apartment   located on the second floor  front      you can sit by the window  dick  and keep a lookout for the girls    said sam      yes  they ll be here in about an hour   said tom   they telephoned  this morning       well  what have you discovered  anything   demanded dick impatiently      i think i am on the right track   answered tom   let me tell you what  i ve done  in the first place  i visited the haunted house yesterday  morning  and went through it from cellar to garret       alone   queried sam      yes  alone  but i carried a pistol  and i had it ready for use  too       i don t blame you   murmured dick   and i guess you looked to see if  the doors were open  too       i did  and smashed out several windows in the bargain  the first  place i investigated was that fireplace  and in it i found this   and  tom held up a bit of white paper  on it was printed       m b  schlemp    uggist     ain st      that is from a druggist   said dick      exactly  i figure out the name is william b  schlemp  that he is  a druggist  and that he is doing business at some number on main  street   came from tom   but i figure out more than that       what       the paper was crumpled up  and had in it a few grains of a gray  powder  i set the powder on fire and got that strange vapor that  almost strangled us       you did   cried sam   then that stuff came from that druggist beyond  a doubt       so i figure it  but there is no druggist named schlemp here   went on  tom   and the druggist here doesn t know of such a fellow       i know what we can do   cried dick   don t you remember  dan baxter  said he had worked for a wholesale drug house  we can telegraph and  ask him if he knows of this schlemp       then let us do it at once   said tom   i have his route  the one he  said he was to follow      a few minutes later the following message was being flashed over the  wires to dan baxter  then supposed to be located at detroit      send full name and address of blank b  schlemp  druggist  at once   highly important      thomas rover      ashton hotel       that was about all i found at the haunted house that was important    said tom after the message had gone   but i ve found out something  here that may lead to something else of value       what is that   questioned sam      there is a fellow hanging around here named henry parwick  he is  rather dissipated  and does not seem to work for a living  one night  this parwick had been drinking pretty freely  and he got into a  quarrel with one of his companions  they taunted each other about  money  and parwick said he had some good friends up to brill who would  give him all the cash he wanted  the other fellow wanted to know that  was  and parwick winked one eye and answered   oh  there s a reason   buddy  a good reason  they wouldn t dare to refuse me   since that  time i have seen parwick talking to jerry koswell and bart larkspur       do you think this parwick helped koswell and the others in a plot  against us   asked dick      it may be so  anyway  i think parwick has some kind of a hold on  koswell  for i saw jerry give him some money       this is certainly interesting   mused dick   do you suppose we could  corner this parwick and get him to talk       we might  but i have another plan       what is that       to watch parwick  and follow him when i think he is going to meet  koswell and the others  i may be able to overhear their talk       good      after that dick and sam told tom of what had occurred at the college  since their brother had left  sam was just relating the particulars of  a stormy interview with professor sharp when dick uttered a cry      look  here comes dora  and she is running      one after another the brothers ran down to the ground floor of the  hotel and hurried outside      oh  i am so glad i found you all together   cried dora  panting for  breath   come quick       where to   queried dick      down the road about half a mile  we just saw that jerry koswell and  bart larkspur  and they are having a quarrel with a man who acts as if  he was half intoxicated       it must be henry parwick   ejaculated tom      yes  his name is parwick   said dora   we heard koswell mention it       where are they   asked sam as the whole party hurried down the main  street and out of ashton  dora leading the way      they are at a cottage where an old woman named brice lives  we were  going to stop for a drink of water when we heard voices  and saw the  young men  then nellie and grace heard them mention you  and they  asked me to come here and get you just as quickly as possible  they  said they would remain  and  if possible  hear what it was all about       i think we are on the right track   cried dick joyfully   maybe  matters will come to a head quicker than we imagined       dick  you stay with dora   cried tom   come on  sam   and off the two  brothers sped at top speed  leaving dick and dora to follow as rapidly  as the strength of the girl would permit     curiosity lent strength to the legs of the two rovers  and they  covered the distance to the brice cottage in an incredibly short space  of time  as they came into view they beheld grace watching for them   she held up her hand for caution  she was standing in among some  bushes by the roadside      be careful  or those wicked boys will see you   she cried in a low  voice   they are back of the cottage  near the barn       where is nellie   asked tom      she is watching them       have you learned anything   asked sam      yes  indeed  we have learned that koswell  larkspur and flockley were  guilty of this plot against you  and that a man named parwick aided  them by getting a strange powder for them  the powder that made you  dizzy and sick   were grace s words  and they filled the rovers with  much satisfaction           chapter xxx    a beginning and an ending       it was allan charter s coming that clinched matters   said tom    doctor wallington might not have believed us  but he had to believe  charter       he had to believe the girls  too   added dick   he knew they would  not tell him such falsehoods  but i am glad charter came along  he  hated to get mixed up in it  i know  but he acted the man about it   didn t he       wonder what the doctor will do with koswell   company   questioned  sam      fire  em  most likely  and they deserve to be fired   growled  stanley   oh  when i think of the trick that was played i feel like  wiping up the floor with every one of those scoundrels       it was certainly a bit of dirty work   was dick s comment     the boys were seated in sam and tom s room  talking it over  it was  sunday afternoon  and outside the sun shone brightly and a light  breeze stirred the trees     it had proved a strenuous saturday afternoon and evening  dick and  dora had come up  meeting allan charter  the leading senior of brill   on the way  they had persuaded charter to accompany them to the brice  cottage  and there all had witnessed a bitter quarrel between  henry parwick and koswell  larkspur and flockley  parwick was  semi intoxicated  and in a maudlin way had exposed all that had been  done at the haunted house  he had spoken about getting the powder for  them  and mentioned how koswell had fixed a fuse and lit it  and he  told of getting the liquor bottles and flasks and other things  he had  warmed up during his recital  and had demanded fifty dollars on the  spot  when refused he had threatened to go to the brill authorities  and  blow everything   then koswell had threatened  if this was done   that he would have parwick arrested for robbing his former employer   william schlemp  then had come blows  and in the midst of this charter  had stepped forward and confronted the evildoers      we have seen and heard all   he had said sternly   i am a witness   and so are these young ladies  you  koswell  flockley and larkspur   ought to be ashamed of yourselves  i never dreamed any students of  brill could be so bad  i shall report to doctor wallington without  delay      charter had been as good as his word  and had been closeted with the  head of the college for an hour  the girls went back with tom  dick  and sam  and also had an interview with the president  then doctor  wallington sent for flockley  koswell and larkspur  only flockley  answered the summons  and it was learned that koswell and larkspur  were afraid to come back  fearing arrest  parwick had also  disappeared  then had come a telegram from dan baxter giving the  address of the druggist  schlemp  word was sent to this man  and later  he wrote that parwick had once worked for him  but had been discharged  for drunkenness and because he was not honest     the interview between doctor wallington and flockley was a most  affecting one  the dudish student broke down utterly  and confessed  all  he said koswell had hatched out the plot  aided by larkspur  and  that he himself had been a more or less unwilling participant  he told  much about parwick  and how that dissolute fellow had spoken of having  the strange powder  which was a japanese concoction  and which  if  used often  would render a person insane  he begged the good doctor to  forgive him  and said he would be willing to do anything in order to  remain at brill      my father will never forgive me if i am dismissed   he said in a  broken voice      but supposing i had dismissed the rovers and stanley browne   asked  the doctor severely      yes  yes  i know  sir   wailed flockley   but  oh  sir  don t send me  away  i ll do anything if you ll let me stay       i will think it over   answered the head of brill shortly  and thus  flockley was dismissed from the office      it was certainly a wicked piece of work   said songbird to the others  in the room   i really think somebody ought to be arrested      tom was about to speak when a footstep sounded in the hall  and a  knock on the door followed  sam opened the portal  to behold flockley  standing there  hat in hand  the dudish student was as white as the  wall  his clothing looked dishevelled  and his shoes were un blacked   a great contrast to the flockley of old      what do you want   asked sam abruptly      i want  i want    commenced flockley brokenly  then he stepped into  the room and confronted dick   oh  rover   he cried   won t you  won t  you please  please get doctor wallington to let me stay at brill   please don t let him send me home  i ll do anything  apologize  get  down on my knees  if you like  but please help me to stay here      flockley caught dick by the arm and continued to plead  and then he  entreated sam  tom  and stanley  also  it was a truly affecting scene   they all commenced to speak  he had been so mean  wicked  so unlike a  decent college fellow  how could they forgive him     and then came a pause  and during that pause a distant church bell  sounded out  full and clear  across the hills surrounding brill  dick  listened  and so did his brothers and stanley  and the anger in their  faces died down      well  i m willing you should stay   said dick   and i ll speak to the  doctor about it  if you wish       and so will i   added sam and tom  and stanley nodded      but you ought to cut such fellows as koswell and larkspur   said tom      i will  i will   said flockley earnestly     the rovers and stanley browne were as good as their word  on the  following day they had another interview with the head of the college  and spoke of flockley      well  if you desire it  he can remain   said doctor wallington   as  for koswell and larkspur  i doubt if they wish to return  since they  have not yet shown themselves  you can prosecute them if you wish       no  we don t want to do that   said dick   we have talked it over   and we think  for the honor of brill  the least said the better       that conclusion does you much credit  and i feel greatly relieved    said the head of the college  he turned to tom   you are  of course   reinstated  thomas  and i shall see to it that the marks placed  against your name are wiped out  i sincerely trust that you and  professor sharp will allow bygones to be bygones  and will make a new  beginning       i m willing   answered tom  and a little later he entered one of  the classrooms and he and professor sharp shook hands  after school  professor blackie came up and shook hands all around      i am glad to know you are exonerated   said that professor   this has  taught me a lesson  to take nothing for granted   he added     when the truth became known many of the students flocked around the  rovers and stanley and songbird  and congratulated them on the  outcome of the affair  flockley did not show himself for a long time   excepting at meals and during class hours      he feels his position keenly   said dick   well  i hope he turns over  a new leaf       a telegram for richard rover   said one of the teachers to the boys a  few days later      wonder what s up now   mused dick as he tore open the yellow  envelope  he read the slip inside   hurrah  this is the best news  yet   he cried      what is it   asked tom and sam      the injunction against the stanhopes and the lanings is dissolved  by the court  they can keep the fortune  tad sobber has had his case  thrown out of court       say  that s great   ejaculated tom  and in the fullness of his  spirits he turned a handspring      i reckon that s the end of mr  tad sobber   said sam  but the  youngest rover was mistaken  though beaten in court  sobber did not  give up all idea of gaining possession of the fortune  and what he did  next will be related in another volume  to be called  the rover boys  down east  or  the struggle for the stanhope fortune   in that book we  shall also meet jerry koswell and bart larkspur once more  and learn  how they tried again to injure our friends     but for the time being all went well  and the rover boys were  exceedingly happy  as soon as possible they met the girls and all  spent a happy half day in taking another ride in an automobile  from  flockley they gradually learned how koswell and larkspur had done many  mean things  including putting the glass in the roadway  and using the  pencil box out of tom s dress suit case      vacation will soon be at hand   cried sam one day   and then        well have the best time ever known   finished tom      ah  vacation time   put in songbird   i have composed some verses  about that season  they run like this        not to day  songbird   interrupted dick   i ve got to bone away at my  geometry       then hurry up  dick   said sam   i want you to come and play ball       ball it is  in half an hour   answered dick   and then   he added  softly to himself   then i guess i ll write a good long letter to  dora      the end            felt quite upset  ah  that wretched  toil doomed flesh that hastened to offer itself without waiting until  it was even ripe for work  ah  the laborer who is prepared to lie  whom  hunger sets against the very law designed for his own protection     when la moineaude had gone off in despair the doctor continued speaking  of juvenile and female labor  as soon as a woman first finds herself a  mother she can no longer continue toiling at a factory  her lying in and  the nursing of her babe force her to remain at home  or else grievous  infirmities may ensue for her and her offspring  as for the child  it  becomes anemic  sometimes crippled  besides  it helps to keep wages down  by being taken to work at a low scale of remuneration  then the doctor  went on to speak of the prolificness of wretchedness  the swarming of  the lower classes  was not the most hateful natality of all that which  meant the endless increase of starvelings and social rebels      i perfectly understand you   beauchene ended by saying  without any  show of anger  as he abruptly brought his perambulations to an end   you  want to place me in contradiction with myself  and make me confess that  i accept moineaud s seven children and need them  whereas i  with my  fixed determination to rest content with an only son  suppress  as it  were  a family in order that i may not have to subdivide my estate   france   the country of only sons   as folks say nowadays  that s it   eh  but  my dear fellow  the question is so intricate  and at bottom i  am altogether in the right      then he wished to explain things  and clapped his hand to his breast   exclaiming that he was a liberal  a democrat  ready to demand all  really progressive measures  he willingly recognized that children were  necessary  that the army required soldiers  and the factories workmen   only he also invoked the prudential duties of the higher classes  and  reasoned after the fashion of a man of wealth  a conservative clinging  to the fortune he has acquired     mathieu meanwhile ended by understanding the brutal truth  capital  is compelled to favor the multiplication of lives foredoomed to  wretchedness  in spite of everything it must stimulate the prolificness  of the wage earning classes  in order that its profits may continue   the law is that there must always be an excess of children in order that  there may be enough cheap workers  then also speculation on the wages   ratio wrests all nobility from labor  which is regarded as the worst  misfortune a man can be condemned to  when in reality it is the most  precious of boons  such  then  is the cancer preying upon mankind  in  countries of political equality and economical inequality the capitalist  regime  the faulty distribution of wealth  at once restrains and  precipitates the birth rate by perpetually increasing the wrongful  apportionment of means  on one side are the rich folk with  only  sons   who continually increase their fortunes  on the other  the poor folk   who  by reason of their unrestrained prolificness  see the little they  possess crumble yet more and more  if labor be honored to morrow  if  a just apportionment of wealth be arrived at  equilibrium will be  restored  otherwise social revolution lies at the end of the road     but beauchene  in his triumphant manner  tried to show that he possessed  great breadth of mind  he admitted the disquieting strides of a decrease  of population  and denounced the causes of it  alcoholism  militarism   excessive mortality among infants  and other numerous matters  then he  indicated remedies  first  reductions in taxation  fiscal means in which  he had little faith  then freedom to will one s estate as one pleased   which seemed to him more efficacious  a change  too  in the marriage  laws  without forgetting the granting of affiliation rights     however  boutan ended by interrupting him   all the legislative measures  in the world will do nothing   said the doctor   manners and customs   our notions of what is moral and what is not  our very conceptions  of the beautiful in life  all must be changed  if france is becoming  depopulated  it is because she so chooses  it is simply necessary then  for her to choose so no longer  but what a task  a whole world to create  anew      at this mathieu raised a superb cry   well  we ll create it  i ve begun  well enough  surely      but constance  after laughing in a constrained way  in her turn thought  it as well to change the subject  and so she at last replied to his  invitation  saying that she would do her best to go to janville  though  she feared she might not be able to dispose of a sunday to do so     dr  boutan then took his leave  and was escorted to the door by  beauchene  who still went on jesting  like a man well pleased with life   one who was satisfied with himself and others  and who felt certain of  being able to arrange things as might best suit his pleasure and his  interests     an hour later  a few minutes after midday  as mathieu  who had been  delayed in the works  went up to the offices to fetch morange as he  had promised to do  it occurred to him to take a short cut through the  women s workshop  and there  in that spacious gallery  already deserted  and silent  he came upon an unexpected scene which utterly amazed  him  on some pretext or other norine had lingered there the last  and  beauchene was with her  clasping her around the waist whilst he eagerly  pressed his lips to hers  but all at once they caught sight of mathieu  and remained thunderstruck  and he  for his part  fled precipitately   deeply annoyed at having been a surprised witness to such a secret           ii    morange  the chief accountant at beauchene s works  was a man of  thirty eight  bald and already gray headed  but with a superb dark   fan shaped beard  of which he was very proud  his full limpid eyes   straight nose  and well shaped if somewhat large mouth had in his  younger days given him the reputation of being a handsome fellow  he  still took great care of himself  invariably wore a tall silk hat  and  preserved the correct appearance of a very painstaking and well bred  clerk      you don t know our new flat yet  do you   he asked mathieu as he led  him away   oh  it s perfect  as you will see  a bedroom for us and  another for reine  and it is so close to the works too  i get there in  four minutes  watch in hand      he  morange  was the son of a petty commercial clerk who had died on his  stool after forty years of cloistral office life  and he had married a  clerk s daughter  one valerie duchemin  the eldest of four girls whose  parents  home had been turned into a perfect hell  full of shameful  wretchedness and unacknowledgable poverty  through this abominable  incumbrance  valerie  who was good looking and ambitious  was lucky  enough  however  to marry that handsome  honest  and hard working  fellow  morange  although she was quite without a dowry  and  this  accomplished  she indulged in the dream of climbing a little higher up  the social ladder  and freeing herself from the loathsome world of petty  clerkdom by making the son whom she hoped to have either an advocate or  a doctor  unfortunately the much desired child proved to be a girl  and  valerie trembled  fearful of finding herself at last with four daughters  on her hands  just as her mother had  her dream thereupon changed  and  she resolved to incite her husband onward to the highest posts  so that  she might ultimately give her daughter a large dowry  and by this means  gain that admittance to superior spheres which she so eagerly desired   her husband  who was weak and extremely fond of her  ended by sharing  her ambition  ever revolving schemes of pride and conquest for her  benefit  but he had now been eight years at the beauchene works  and  he still earned but five thousand francs a year  this drove him and his  wife to despair  assuredly it was not at beauchene s that he would ever  make his fortune      you see   he exclaimed  after going a couple of hundred yards with  mathieu along the boulevard de grenelle   it is that new house yonder at  the street corner  it has a stylish appearance  eh      mathieu then perceived a lofty modern pile  ornamented with balconies  and sculpture work  which looked quite out of place among the poor  little houses predominating in the district      why  it is a palace   he exclaimed  in order to please morange  who  thereupon drew himself up quite proudly      you will see the staircase  my dear fellow  our place  you know  is on  the fifth floor  but that is of no consequence with such a staircase  so  easy  so soft  that one climbs it almost without knowing      thereupon morange showed his guest into the vestibule as if he were  ushering him into a temple  the stucco walls gleamed brightly  there was  a carpet on the stairs  and colored glass in the windows  and when  on  reaching the fifth story  the cashier opened the door with his latchkey   he repeated  with an air of delight   you will see  you will see      valerie and reine must have been on the watch  for they hastened  forward  at thirty two valerie was still young and charming  she was  a pleasant looking brunette  with a round smiling face in a setting of  superb hair  she had a full  round bust  and admirable shoulders  of  which her husband felt quite proud whenever she showed herself in a  low necked dress  reine  at this time twelve years old  was the very  portrait of her mother  showing much the same smiling  if rather longer   face under similar black tresses      ah  it is very kind of you to accept our invitation   said valerie  gayly as she pressed both mathieu s hands   what a pity that madame  froment could not come with you  reine  why don t you relieve the  gentleman of his hat      then she immediately continued   we have a nice light anteroom  you see   would you like to glance over our flat while the eggs are being boiled   that will always be one thing done  and you will then at least know  where you are lunching      all this was said in such an agreeable way  and morange on his side  smiled so good naturedly  that mathieu willingly lent himself to this  innocent display of vanity  first came the parlor  the corner room   the walls of which were covered with pearl gray paper with a design of  golden flowers  while the furniture consisted of some of those white  lacquered louis xvi  pieces which makers turn out by the gross  the  rosewood piano showed like a big black blot amidst all the rest  then   overlooking the boulevard de grenelle  came reine s bedroom  pale  blue  with furniture of polished pine  her parents  room  a very small  apartment  was at the other end of the flat  separated from the  parlor by the dining room  the hangings adorning it were yellow  and a  bedstead  a washstand  and a wardrobe  all of thuya  had been crowded  into it  finally the classic  old carved oak  triumphed in the  dining room  where a heavily gilded hanging lamp flashed like fire above  the table  dazzling in its whiteness      why  it s delightful   mathieu  repeated  by way of politeness   why   it s a real gem of a place      in their excitement  father  mother  and daughter never ceased leading  him hither and thither  explaining matters to him and making him feel  the things  he was most struck  by the circumstance that the place  recalled something he had seen before  he seemed to be familiar with the  arrangement of the drawing room  and with the way in which the  nicknacks in the bedchamber were set out  and all at once he remembered   influenced by envy and covert admiration  the moranges  despite  themselves  no doubt  had tried to copy the beauchenes  always short  of money as they were  they could only and by dint of great sacrifices  indulge in a species of make believe luxury  nevertheless they were  proud of it  and  by imitating the envied higher class from afar  they  imagined that they drew nearer to it      and then   morange exclaimed  as he opened the dining room window    there is also this      outside  a balcony ran along the house front  and at that height the  view was really a very fine one  similar to that obtained from the  beauchene mansion but more extensive  the seine showing in the distance   and the heights of passy rising above the nearer and lower house roofs     valerie also called attention to the prospect   it is magnificent  is it  not   said she   far better than the few trees that one can see from the  quay      the servant was now bringing the boiled eggs and they took their seats  at table  while morange victoriously explained that the place altogether  cost him sixteen hundred francs a year  it was cheap indeed  though the  amount was a heavy charge on morange s slender income  mathieu now began  to understand that he had been invited more particularly to admire the  new flat  and these worthy people seemed so delighted to triumph over it  before him that he took the matter gayly and without thought of spite   there was no calculating ambition in his nature  he envied nothing of  the luxury he brushed against in other people s homes  and he was  quite satisfied with the snug modest life he led with marianne and  his children  thus he simply felt surprised at finding the moranges so  desirous of cutting a figure and making money  and looked at them with a  somewhat sad smile     valerie was wearing a pretty gown of foulard with a pattern of little  yellow flowers  while her daughter  reine  whom she liked to deck out  coquettishly  had a frock of blue linen stuff  there was rather too  much luxury about the meal also  soles followed the eggs  and then came  cutlets  and afterwards asparagus     the conversation began with some mention of janville      and so your children are in good health  oh  they are very fine  children indeed  and you really like the country  how funny  i think  i should feel dreadfully bored there  for there is too great a lack  of amusements  why  yes  we shall be delighted to go to see you there   since madame froment is kind enough to invite us      then  as was bound to happen  the talk turned on the beauchenes   this was a subject which haunted the moranges  who lived in perpetual  admiration of the beauchenes  though at times they covertly criticised  them  valerie was very proud of being privileged to attend constance s  saturday  at homes   and of having been twice invited to dinner by her  during the previous winter  she on her side now had a day of her own   tuesday  and she even gave little private parties  and half ruined  herself in providing refreshments at them  as for her acquaintances   she spoke with profound respect of mme  seguin du hordel and that lady s  magnificent mansion in the avenue d antin  for constance had obligingly  obtained her an invitation to a ball there  but she was particularly  vain of the friendship of beauchene s sister  seraphine  whom she  invariably called  madame la baronne de lowicz       the baroness came to my at home one afternoon   she said   she is so  very good natured and so gay  you knew her formerly  did you not  after  her marriage  eh  when she became reconciled to her brother and their  wretched disputes about money matters were over  by the way  she has no  great liking for madame beauchene  as you must know      then she again reverted to the manufacturer s wife  declared that little  maurice  however sturdy he might look  was simply puffed out with bad  flesh  and she remarked that it would be a terrible blow for the parents  if they should lose that only son  the subject of children was thus  started  and when mathieu  laughing  observed that they  the moranges   had but one child  the cashier protested that it was unfair to compare  him with m  beauchene  who was such a wealthy man  valerie  for  her part  pictured the position of her parents  afflicted with four  daughters  who had been obliged to wait months and months for boots and  frocks and hats  and had grown up anyhow  in perpetual terror lest they  should never find husbands  a family was all very well  but when it  happened to consist of daughters the situation became terrible for  people of limited means  for if daughters were to be launched properly  into life they must have dowries      besides   said she   i am very ambitious for my husband  and i am  convinced that he may rise to a very high position if he will only  listen to me  but he must not be saddled with a lot of incumbrances  as  things stand  i trust that we may be able to get rich and give reine a  suitable dowry      morange  quite moved by this little speech  caught hold of his wife s  hand and kissed it  weak and good natured as he was  valerie was really  the one with will  it was she who had instilled some ambition into him   and he esteemed her the more for it      my wife is a thoroughly good woman  you know  my dear froment   said  he   she has a good head as well as a good heart      then  while valerie recapitulated her dream of wealth  the splendid flat  she would have  the receptions she would hold  and the two months  which  like the beauchenes  she would spend at the seaside every summer   mathieu looked at her and her husband and pondered their position  their  case was very different from that of old moineaud  who knew that he  would never be a cabinet minister  morange possibly dreamt that his wife  would indeed make him a minister some day  every petty bourgeois in a  democratic community has a chance of rising and wishes to do so  indeed   there is a universal  ferocious rush  each seeking to push the others  aside so that he may the more speedily climb a rung of the social  ladder  this general ascent  this phenomenon akin to capillarity   is possible only in a country where political equality and economic  inequality prevail  for each has the same right to fortune and has but  to conquer it  there is  however  a struggle of the vilest egotism  if  one wishes to taste the pleasures of the highly placed  pleasures which  are displayed to the gaze of all and are eagerly coveted by nearly  everybody in the lower spheres  under a democratic constitution a nation  cannot live happily if its manners and customs are not simple  and if  the conditions of life are not virtually equal for one and all   under other circumstances than these the liberal professions prove  all devouring  there is a rush for public functions  manual toil is  regarded with contempt  luxury increases and becomes necessary  and  wealth and power are furiously appropriated by assault in order that one  may greedily taste the voluptuousness of enjoyment  and in such a state  of affairs  children  as valerie put it  were incumbrances  whereas one  needed to be free  absolutely unburdened  if one wished to climb over  all one s competitors     mathieu also thought of that law of imitation which impels even the  least fortunate to impoverish themselves by striving to copy the happy  ones of the world  how great the distress which really lurks beneath  that envied luxury that is copied at such great cost  all sorts of  useless needs are created  and production is turned aside from the  strictly necessary  one can no longer express hardship by saying that  people lack bread  what they lack in the majority of cases is the  superfluous  which they are unable to renounce without imagining that  they have gone to the dogs and are in danger of starvation     at dessert  when the servant was no longer present  morange  excited by  his good meal  became expansive  glancing at his wife he winked towards  their guest  saying      come  he s a safe friend  one may tell him everything      and when valerie had consented with a smile and a nod  he went on    well  this is the matter  my dear fellow  it is possible that i may  soon leave the works  oh  it s not decided  but i m thinking of it  yes   i ve been thinking of it for some months past  for  when all is said  to  earn five thousand francs a year  after eight years  zeal  and to think  that one will never earn much more  is enough to make one despair of  life       it s monstrous   the young woman interrupted   it is like breaking  one s head intentionally against a wall       well  in such circumstances  my dear friend  the best course is to look  out for something elsewhere  is it not  do you remember michaud  whom i  had under my orders at the works some six years ago  a very intelligent  fellow he was  well  scarcely six years have elapsed since he left us  to go to the credit national  and what do you think he is now earning  there  twelve thousand francs  you hear me  twelve thousand francs      the last words rang out like a trumpet call  the moranges  eyes dilated  with ecstasy  even the little girl became very red      last march   continued morange   i happened to meet michaud  who told  me all that  and showed himself very amiable  he offered to take me  with him and help me on in my turn  only there s some risk to run  he  explained to me that i must at first accept three thousand six hundred   so as to rise gradually to a very big figure  but three thousand six  hundred  how can one live on that in the meantime  especially now that  this flat has increased our expenses      at this valerie broke in impetuously    nothing venture  nothing have    that s what i keep on repeating to him  of course i am in favor of  prudence  i would never let him do anything rash which might compromise  his future  but  at the same time  he can t moulder away in a situation  unworthy of him       and so you have made up your minds   asked mathieu      well  my wife has calculated everything   morange replied   and  yes   we have made up our minds  provided  of course  that nothing unforeseen  occurs  besides  it is only in october that any situation will be open  at the credit national  but  i say  my dear friend  keep the matter  entirely to yourself  for we don t want to quarrel with the beauchenes  just now      then he looked at his watch  for  like a good clerk  he was very  punctual  and did not wish to be late at the office  the servant was  hurried  the coffee was served  and they were drinking it  boiling hot  as it was  when the arrival of a visitor upset the little household and  caused everything to be forgotten      oh   exclaimed valerie  as she hastily rose  flushed with pride    madame la baronne de lowicz      seraphine  at this time nine and twenty  was red haired  tall and  elegant  with magnificent shoulders which were known to all paris  her  red lips were wreathed in a triumphant smile  and a voluptuous flame  ever shone in her large brown eyes flecked with gold      pray don t disturb yourselves  my friends   said she   your servant  wanted to show me into the drawing room  but i insisted on coming in  here  because it is rather a pressing matter  i have come to fetch your  charming little reine to take her to a matinee at the circus      a fresh explosion of delight ensued  the child remained speechless with  joy  whilst the mother exulted and rattled on   oh  madame la baronne   you are really too kind  you are spoiling the child  but the fact is  that she isn t dressed  and you will have to wait a moment  come  child   make haste  i will help you  ten minutes  you understand  i won t keep  you waiting a moment longer      seraphine remained alone with the two men  she had made a gesture of  surprise on perceiving mathieu  whose hand  like an old friend  she now  shook      and you  are you quite well   she asked      quite well   he answered  and as she sat down near him he instinctively  pushed his chair back  he did not seem at all pleased at having met her     he had been on familiar terms with her during his earlier days at the  beauchene works  she was a frantic pleasure lover  and destitute of both  conscience and moral principles  her conduct had given rise to scandal  even before her extraordinary elopement with baron de lowicz  that needy  adventurer with a face like an archangel s and the soul of a swindler   the result of the union was a stillborn child  then seraphine  who was  extremely egotistical and avaricious  quarrelled with her husband and  drove him away  he repaired to berlin  and was killed there in a brawl  at a gambling den  delighted at being rid of him  seraphine made every  use of her liberty as a young widow  she figured at every fete  took  part in every kind of amusement  and many scandalous stories were told  of her  but she contrived to keep up appearances and was thus still  received everywhere      you are living in the country  are you not   she asked again  turning  towards mathieu      yes  we have been there for three weeks past       constance told me of it  i met her the other day at madame seguin s   we are on the best terms possible  you know  now that i give my brother  good advice      in point of fact her sister in law  constance  hated her  but with her  usual boldness she treated the matter as a joke      we talked about dr  gaude   she resumed   i fancied that she wanted to  ask for his address  but she did not dare       dr  gaude   interrupted morange   ah  yes  a friend of my wife s spoke  to her about him  he s a wonderfully clever man  it appears  some of his  operations are like miracles      then he went on talking of dr  gaude s clinic at the hopital marbeuf  a  clinic whither society folks hastened to see operations performed  just  as they might go to a theatre  the doctor  who was fond of money  and  who bled his wealthy lady patients in more senses than one  was  likewise partial to glory and proud of accomplishing the most dangerous  experiments on the unhappy creatures who fell into his hands  the  newspapers were always talking about him  his cures were constantly  puffed and advertised by way of inducing fine ladies to trust themselves  to his skill  and he certainly accomplished wonders  cutting and carving  his patients in the quietest  most unconcerned way possible  with never  a scruple  never a doubt as to whether what he did was strictly right or  not     seraphine had begun to laugh  showing her white wolfish teeth between  her blood red lips  when she noticed the horrified expression which had  appeared on mathieu s face since gaude had been spoken of   ah   said  she   there s a man  now  who in nowise resembles your squeamish dr   boutan  who is always prattling about the birth rate  i can t understand  why constance keeps to that old fashioned booby  holding the views  she does  she is quite right  you know  in her opinions  i fully share  them      morange laughed complaisantly  he wished to show her that his opinions  were the same  however  as valerie did not return with reine  he grew  impatient  and asked permission to go and see what they were about   perhaps he himself might be able to help in getting the child ready     as soon as seraphine was alone with mathieu she turned her big  ardent   gold flecked eyes upon him  she no longer laughed with the same laugh as  a moment previously  an expression of voluptuous irony appeared on her  bold bad face  after a spell of silence she inquired   and is my good  cousin marianne quite well       quite well   replied mathieu      and the children are still growing       yes  still growing       so you are happy  like a good paterfamilias  in your little nook       perfectly happy      again she lapsed into silence  but she did not cease to look at him   more provoking  more radiant than ever  with the charm of a young  sorceress whose eyes burn and poison men s hearts  and at last she  slowly resumed   and so it is all over between us      he made a gesture in token of assent  there had long since been a  passing fancy between them  he had been nineteen at the time  and she  two and twenty  he had then but just entered life  and she was already  married  but a few months later he had fallen in love with marianne  and  had then entirely freed himself from her      all over  really   she again inquired  smiling but aggressive     she was looking very beautiful and bold  seeking to tempt him and carry  him off from that silly little cousin of hers  whose tears would simply  have made her laugh  and as mathieu did not this time give her any  answer  even by a wave of the hand  she went on   i prefer that  don t  reply  don t say that it is all over  you might make a mistake  you  know      for a moment mathieu s eyes flashed  then he closed them in order that  he might no longer see seraphine  who was leaning towards him  it seemed  as if all the past were coming back  she almost pressed her lips to his  as she whispered that she still loved him  and when he drew back  full  of mingled emotion and annoyance  she raised her little hand to his  mouth as if she feared that he was again going to say no      be quiet   said she   they are coming      the moranges were now indeed returning with reine  whose hair had been  curled  the child looked quite delicious in her frock of rose silk  decked with white lace  and her large hat trimmed with some of the dress  material  her gay round face showed with flowery delicacy under the rose  silk      oh  what a love   exclaimed seraphine by way of pleasing the parents    somebody will be stealing her from me  you know      then it occurred to her to kiss the child in passionate fashion   feigning the emotion of a woman who regrets that she is childless   yes   indeed one regrets it very much when one sees such a treasure as this  sweet girl of yours  ah  if one could only be sure that god would give  one such a charming child  well  at all events  i shall steal her from  you  you need not expect me to bring her back again      the enraptured moranges laughed delightedly  and mathieu  who knew her  well  listened in stupefaction  how many times during their short and  passionate attachment had she not inveighed against children  in her  estimation maternity poisoned love  aged woman  and made a horror of her  in the eyes of man     the moranges accompanied her and reine to the landing  and they could  not find words warm enough to express their happiness at seeing such  coveted wealth and luxury come to seek their daughter  when the door of  the flat was closed valerie darted on to the balcony  exclaiming   let  us see them drive off      morange  who no longer gave a thought to the office  took up a position  near her  and called mathieu and compelled him likewise to lean over  and look down  a well appointed victoria was waiting below with a  superb looking coachman motionless on the box seat  this sight put a  finishing touch to the excitement of the moranges  when seraphine had  installed the little girl beside her  they laughed aloud      how pretty she looks  how happy she must feel      reine must have been conscious that they were looking at her  for she  raised her head  smiled and bowed  and seraphine did the same  while the  horse broke into a trot and turned the corner of the avenue  then came a  final explosion       look at her   repeated valerie   she is so candid  at twelve years old  she is still as innocent as a child in her cradle  you know that i trust  her to nobody  wouldn t one think her a little duchess who has always  had a carriage of her own      then morange reverted to his dream of fortune   well   said he   i hope  that she  will  have a carriage when we marry her off  just let me get  into the credit national and you will see all your desires fulfilled      and turning towards mathieu he added   there are three of us  and  as  i have said before  that is quite enough for a man to provide for   especially as money is so hard to earn            iii    at the works during the afternoon mathieu  who wished to be free earlier  than usual in order that  before dining in town  he might call upon his  landlord  in accordance with his promise to marianne  found himself so  busy that he scarcely caught sight of beauchene  this was a relief  for  the secret which he had discovered by chance annoyed him  and he feared  lest he might cause his employer embarrassment  but the latter  when  they exchanged a few passing words  did not seem to remember even that  there was any cause for shame on his part  he had never before shown  himself more active  more devoted to business  the fatigue he had felt  in the morning had passed away  and he talked and laughed like one who  finds life very pleasant  and has no fear whatever of hard work     as a rule mathieu left at six o clock  but that day he went into  morange s office at half past five to receive his month s salary  this  rightly amounted to three hundred and fifty francs  but as five hundred  had been advanced to him in january  which he paid back by instalments  of fifty  he now received only fifteen louis  and these he pocketed with  such an air of satisfaction that the accountant commented on it      well   said the young fellow   the money s welcome  for i left my wife  with just thirty sous this morning      it was already more than six o clock when he found himself outside the  superb house which the seguin du hordel family occupied in the avenue  d antin  seguin s grandfather had been a mere tiller of the soil at  janville  later on  his father  as a contractor for the army  had made a  considerable fortune  and he  son of a parvenu  led the life of a  rich  elegant idler  he was a member of the leading clubs  and   while passionately fond of horses  affected also a taste for art and  literature  going for fashion s sake to extreme opinions  he had proudly  married an almost portionless girl of a very ancient aristocratic race   the last of the vaugelades  whose blood was poor and whose mind was  narrow  her mother  an ardent catholic  had only succeeded in making of  her one who  while following religious practices  was eager for the  joys of the world  seguin  since his marriage  had likewise practised  religion  because it was fashionable to do so  his peasant grandfather  had had ten children  his father  the army contractor  had been content  with six  and he himself had two  a boy and a girl  and deemed even that  number more than was right     one part of seguin s fortune consisted of an estate of some twelve  hundred acres  woods and heaths  above janville  which his father had  purchased with some of his large gains after retiring from business   the old man s long caressed dream had been to return in triumph to his  native village  whence he had started quite poor  and he was on the  point of there building himself a princely residence in the midst of a  vast park when death snatched him away  almost the whole of this estate  had come to seguin in his share of the paternal inheritance  and he had  turned the shooting rights to some account by dividing them into shares  of five hundred francs value  which his friends eagerly purchased  the  income derived from this source was  however  but a meagre one  apart  from the woods there was only uncultivated land on the estate  marshes   patches of sand  and fields of stones  and for centuries past the  opinion of the district had been that no agriculturist could ever turn  the expanse to good account  the defunct army contractor alone had been  able to picture there a romantic park  such as he had dreamt of creating  around his regal abode  it was he  by the way  who had obtained an  authorization to add to the name of seguin that of du hordel  taken from  a ruined tower called the hordel which stood on the estate     it was through beauchene  one of the shareholders of the shooting  rights  that mathieu had made seguin s acquaintance  and had discovered  the old hunting box  the lonely  quiet pavilion  which had pleased him  so much that he had rented it  valentine  who good naturedly treated  marianne as a poor friend  had even been amiable enough to visit her  there  and had declared the situation of the place to be quite poetical   laughing the while over her previous ignorance of it like one who had  known nothing of her property  in reality she herself would not have  lived there for an hour  her husband had launched her into the  feverish life of literary  artistic  and social paris  hurrying her  to gatherings  studios  exhibitions  theatres  and other pleasure  resorts  all those brasier like places where weak heads and wavering  hearts are lost  he himself  amid all his passion for show  felt bored  to death everywhere  and was at ease only among his horses  and  this despite his pretensions with respect to advanced literature and  philosophy  his collections of curios  such as the bourgeois of to day  does not yet understand  his furniture  his pottery  his pewter work   and particularly his bookbindings  of which he was very proud  and  he was turning his wife into a copy of himself  perverting her by his  extravagant opinions and his promiscuous friendships  so that the little  devotee who had been confided to his keeping was now on the high road  to every kind of folly  she still went to mass and partook of the holy  communion  but she was each day growing more and more familiar  with wrong doing  a disaster must surely be at the end of it all   particularly as he foolishly behaved to her in a rough  jeering way   which greatly hurt her feelings  and led her to dream of being loved  with gentleness     when mathieu entered the house  which displayed eight lofty windows on  each of the stories of its ornate renaissance facade  he laughed lightly  as he thought   these folks don t have to wait for a monthly pittance of  three hundred francs  with just thirty sous in hand      the hall was extremely rich  all bronze and marble  on the right hand  were the dining room and two drawing rooms  on the left a billiard room   a smoking room  and a winter garden  on the first floor  in front of  the broad staircase  was seguin s so called  cabinet   a vast apartment   sixteen feet high  forty feet long  and six and twenty feet wide  which  occupied all the central part of the house  while the husband s bed and  dressing rooms were on the right  and those of the wife and children  on the left hand  up above  on the second floor  two complete suites of  rooms were kept in reserve for the time when the children should have  grown up     a footman  who knew mathieu  at once took him upstairs to the cabinet  and begged him to wait there  while monsieur finished dressing  for a  moment the visitor fancied himself alone and glanced round the spacious  room  feeling interested in its adornments  the lofty windows of old  stained glass  the hangings of old genoese velvet and brocaded silk  the  oak bookcases showing the highly ornamented backs of the volumes they  contained  the tables laden with bibelots  bronzes  marbles  goldsmith s  work  glass work  and the famous collection of modern pewter work  then  eastern carpets were spread out upon all sides  there were low seats and  couches for every mood of idleness  and cosy nooks in which one could  hide oneself behind fringes of lofty plants      oh  so it s you  monsieur froment   suddenly exclaimed somebody in the  direction of the table allotted to the pewter curios  and thereupon  a tall young man of thirty  whom a screen had hitherto hidden from  mathieu s view  came forward with outstretched hand      ah   said mathieu  after a moment s hesitation   monsieur charles  santerre      this was but their second meeting  they had found themselves together  once before in that same room  charles santerre  already famous as a  novelist  a young master popular in parisian drawing rooms  had a fine  brow  caressing brown eyes  and a large red mouth which his moustache  and beard  cut in the assyrian style and carefully curled  helped to  conceal  he had made his way  thanks to women  whose society he sought  under pretext of studying them  but whom he was resolved to use as  instruments of fortune  as a matter of calculation and principle he  had remained a bachelor and generally installed himself in the nests of  others  in literature feminine frailty was his stock subject he had made  it his specialty to depict scenes of guilty love amid elegant  refined  surroundings  at first he had no illusions as to the literary value of  his works  he had simply chosen  in a deliberate way  what he deemed to  be a pleasant and lucrative trade  but  duped by his successes  he had  allowed pride to persuade him that he was really a writer  and nowadays  he posed as the painter of an expiring society  professing the greatest  pessimism  and basing a new religion on the annihilation of human  passion  which annihilation would insure the final happiness of the  world      seguin will be here in a moment   he resumed in an amiable way   it  occurred to me to take him and his wife to dine at a restaurant this  evening  before going to a certain first performance where there will  probably be some fisticuffs and a rumpus to night      mathieu then for the first time noticed that santerre was in evening  dress  they continued chatting for a moment  and the novelist called  attention to a new pewter treasure among seguin s collection  it  represented a long  thin woman  stretched full length  with her hair  streaming around her  she seemed to be sobbing as she lay there   and santerre declared the conception to be a masterpiece  the figure  symbolized the end of woman  reduced to despair and solitude when man  should finally have made up his mind to have nothing further to do with  her  it was the novelist who  in literary and artistic matters  helped  on the insanity which was gradually springing up in the seguins  home     however  seguin himself now made his appearance  he was of the same age  as santerre  but was taller and slimmer  with fair hair  an aquiline  nose  gray eyes  and thin lips shaded by a slight moustache  he also was  in evening dress      ah  well  my dear fellow   said he with the slight lisp which he  affected   valentine is determined to put on a new gown  so we must be  patient  we shall have an hour to wait      then  on catching sight of mathieu  he began to apologize  evincing much  politeness and striving to accentuate his air of frigid distinction   when the young man  whom he called his amiable tenant  had acquainted  him with the motive of his visit  the leak in the zinc roof of the  little pavilion at janville  he at once consented to let the local  plumber do any necessary soldering  but when  after fresh explanations   he understood that the roofing was so worn and damaged that it required  to be changed entirely  he suddenly departed from his lofty affability  and began to protest  declaring that he could not possibly expend in  such repairs a sum which would exceed the whole annual rental of six  hundred francs      some soldering   he repeated   some soldering  it s understood  i will  write to the plumber   and wishing to change the subject he added   oh   wait a moment  monsieur froment  you are a man of taste  i know  and i  want to show you a marvel      he really had some esteem for mathieu  for he knew that the young fellow  possessed a quick appreciative mind  mathieu began to smile  outwardly  yielding to this attempt to create a diversion  but determined at heart  that he would not leave the place until he had obtained the promise of  a new roof  he took hold of a book  clad in a marvellous binding  which  seguin had fetched from a bookcase and tendered with religious care  on  the cover of soft snow white leather was incrusted a long silver lily   intersected by a tuft of big violet thistles  the title of the work    beauty imperishable   was engraved up above  as in a corner of the sky      ah  what a delightful conception  what delightful coloring   declared  mathieu  who was really charmed   some bindings nowadays are perfect  gems   then he noticed the title   why  it s monsieur santerre s last  novel   said he     seguin smiled and glanced at the writer  who had drawn near  and when  he saw him examining the book and looking quite moved by the compliment  paid to it  he exclaimed   my dear fellow  the binder brought it here  this morning  and i was awaiting an opportunity to surprise you with it   it is the pearl of my collection  what do you think of the idea  that  lily which symbolizes triumphant purity  and those thistles  the plants  which spring up among ruins  and which symbolize the sterility of the  world  at last deserted  again won over to the only perfect felicity   all your work lies in those symbols  you know       yes  yes  but you spoil me  you will end by making me proud      mathieu had read santerre s novel  having borrowed a copy of it from  mme  beauchene  in order that his wife might see it  since it was a book  that everybody was talking of  and the perusal of it had exasperated  him  forsaking the customary bachelor s flat where in previous works he  had been so fond of laying scenes of debauchery  santerre had this time  tried to rise to the level of pure art and lyrical symbolism  the story  he told was one of a certain countess anne marie  who  to escape a  rough mannered husband of extreme masculinity  had sought a refuge  in brittany in the company of a young painter endowed with divine  inspiration  one norbert  who had undertaken to decorate a convent  chapel with paintings that depicted his various visions  and for thirty  years he went on painting there  ever in colloquy with the angels  and  ever having anne marie beside him  and during those thirty years of love  the countess s beauty remained unimpaired  she was as young and as fresh  at the finish as at the outset  whereas certain secondary personages   introduced into the story  wives and mothers of a neighboring little  town  sank into physical and mental decay  and monstrous decrepitude   mathieu considered the author s theory that all physical beauty and  moral nobility belonged to virgins only  to be thoroughly imbecile  and  he could not restrain himself from hinting his disapproval of it     both santerre and seguin  however  hotly opposed him  and quite a  discussion ensued  first santerre took up the matter from a religious  standpoint  said he  the words of the old testament   increase and  multiply   were not to be found in the new testament  which was the true  basis of the christian religion  the first christians  he declared  had  held marriage in horror  and with them the holy virgin had become the  ideal of womanhood  seguin thereupon nodded approval and proceeded to  give his opinions on feminine beauty  but these were hardly to the taste  of mathieu  who promptly pointed out that the conception of beauty had  often varied      to day   said he   you conceive beauty to consist in a long  slim   attenuated  almost angular figure  but at the time of the renaissance  the type of the beautiful was very different  take rubens  take titian   take even raffaelle  and you will see that their women were of robust  build  even their virgin marys have a motherly air  to my thinking   moreover  if we reverted to some such natural type of beauty  if women  were not encouraged by fashion to compress and attenuate their figures  so that their very nature  their very organism is changed  there would  perhaps be some hope of coping with the evil of depopulation which is  talked about so much nowadays      the others looked at him and smiled with an air of compassionate  superiority   depopulation an evil   exclaimed seguin   can you  my dear  sir  intelligent as you are  still believe in that hackneyed old story   come  reflect and reason a little      then santerre chimed in  and they went on talking one after the other  and at times both together  schopenhauer and hartmann and nietzsche were  passed in review  and they claimed malthus as one of themselves  but all  this literary pessimism did not trouble mathieu  he  with his belief  in fruitfulness  remained convinced that the nation which no longer had  faith in life must be dangerously ill  true  there were hours when he  doubted the expediency of numerous families and asked himself if ten  thousand happy people were not preferable to a hundred thousand unhappy  ones  in which connection political and economic conditions had to be  taken into account  but when all was said  he remained almost convinced  that the malthusian hypotheses would prove as false in the future as  they had proved false in the past      moreover   said he   even if the world should become densely populated   even if food supplies  such as we know them  should fall short   chemistry would extract other means of subsistence from inorganic  matter  and  besides  all such eventualities are so far away that it is  impossible to make any calculation on a basis of scientific certainty   in france  too  instead of contributing to any such danger  we are going  backward  we are marching towards annihilation  the population of  france was once a fourth of the population of europe  but now it is only  one eighth  in a century or two paris will be dead  like ancient athens  and ancient rome  and we shall have fallen to the rank that greece now  occupies  paris seems determined to die      but santerre protested   no  no  paris simply wishes to remain  stationary  and it wishes this precisely because it is the most  intelligent  most highly civilized city in the world  the more nations  advance in civilization the smaller becomes their birth rate  we  are simply giving the world an example of high culture  superior  intelligence  and other nations will certainly follow that example when  in turn they also attain to our state of perfection  there are signs of  this already on every side       quite so   exclaimed seguin  backing up his friend   the phenomenon is  general  all the nations show the same symptoms  and are decreasing in  numbers  or will decrease as soon as they become civilized  japan is  affected already  and the same will be the case with china as soon as  europe forces open the door there      mathieu had become grave and attentive since the two society men  seated  before him in evening dress  had begun to talk more rationally  the  pale  slim  flat virgin  their ideal of feminine beauty  was no longer  in question  the history of mankind was passing by  and almost as if  communing with himself  he said   so you do not fear the yellow peril   that terrible swarming of asiatic barbarians who  it was said  would  at some fatal moment sweep down on our europe  ravage it  and people it  afresh  in past ages  history always began anew in that fashion  by the  sudden shifting of oceans  the invasion of fierce rough races coming to  endow weakened nations with new blood  and after each such occurrence  civilization flowered afresh  more broadly and freely than ever  how  was it that babylon  nineveh  and memphis fell into dust with their  populations  who seem to have died on the spot  how is it that athens  and rome still agonize to day  unable to spring afresh from their ashes  and renew the splendor of their ancient glory  how is it that death has  already laid its hand upon paris  which  whatever her splendor  is but  the capital of a france whose virility is weakened  you may argue as you  please and say that  like the ancient capitals of the world  paris is  dying of an excess of culture  intelligence  and civilization  it is  none the less a fact that she is approaching death  the turn of the tide  which will carry splendor and power to some new nation  your theory of  equilibrium is wrong  nothing can remain stationary  whatever ceases to  grow  decreases and disappears  and if paris is bent on dying  she will  die  and the country with her       well  for my part   declared santerre  resuming the pose of an elegant  pessimist   if she wishes to die  i shan t oppose her  in fact  i m  fully determined to help her       it is evident that the really honest  sensible course is to check any  increase of population   added seguin     but mathieu  as if he had not heard them  went on   i know herbert  spencer s law  and i believe it to be theoretically correct  it is  certain that civilization is a check to fruitfulness  so that one may  picture a series of social evolutions conducing now to decrease and now  to increase of population  the whole ending in final equilibrium  by  the very effect of culture s victory when the world shall be entirely  populated and civilized  but who can foretell what road will be  followed  through what disasters and sufferings one may have to go  more  and more nations may disappear  and others may replace them  and how  many thousands of years may not be needed before the final adjustment   compounded of truth  justice  and peace  is arrived at  at the thought  of this the mind trembles and hesitates  and the heart contracts with a  pang      deep silence fell while he thus remained disturbed  shaken in his faith  in the good powers of life  and at a loss as to who was right  he or  those two men so languidly stretched out before him     but valentine  seguin s wife  came in  laughing and making an exhibition  of masculine ways  which it had cost her much trouble to acquire      ah  you people  you must not bear me any malice  you know  that girl  celeste takes such a time over everything      at five and twenty valentine was short  slight  and still girlish  fair   with a delicate face  laughing blue eyes  and a pert little nose  she  could not claim to be pretty  still she was charming and droll  and very  free and easy in her ways  for not only did her husband take her about  with him to all sorts of objectionable places  but she had become quite  familiar with the artists and writers who frequented the house  thus it  was only in the presence of something extremely insulting that she again  showed herself the last of the vaugelades  and would all at once draw  herself up and display haughty contempt and frigidity      ah  it s you  monsieur froment   she said amiably  stepping towards  mathieu and shaking his hand in cavalier fashion   is madame froment in  good health  are the children flourishing as usual      seguin was examining her dress  a gown of white silk trimmed with  unbleached lace  and he suddenly gave way to one of those horribly  rude fits which burst forth at times amid all his great affectation of  politeness   what  have you kept us waiting all this time to put that  rag on  well  you never looked a greater fright in your life      and she had entered the room convinced that she looked charming  she  made an effort to control herself  but her girlish face darkened and  assumed an expression of haughty  vindictive revolt  then she slowly  turned her eyes towards the friend who was present  and who was gazing  at her with ecstasy  striving to accentuate the slavish submissiveness  of his attitude      you look delicious   he murmured   that gown is a marvel      seguin laughed and twitted santerre on his obsequiousness towards women   valentine  mollified by the compliment  soon recovered her birdlike  gayety  and such free and easy conversation ensued between the trio that  mathieu felt both stupefied and embarrassed  in fact  he would have gone  off at once had it not been for his desire to obtain from his landlord a  promise to repair the pavilion properly      wait another moment   valentine at last said to her husband   i  told celeste to bring the children  so that we might kiss them before  starting      mathieu wished to profit by this fresh delay  and sought to renew his  request  but valentine was already rattling on again  talking of dining  at the most disreputable restaurant possible  and asking if at the first  performance which they were to attend they would see all the horrors  which had been hissed at the dress rehearsal the night before  she  appeared like a pupil of the two men between whom she stood  she even  went further in her opinions than they did  displaying the wildest  pessimism  and such extreme views on literature and art that  they themselves could not forbear laughing  wagner was greatly  over estimated  in her opinion  she asked for invertebrate music  the  free harmony of the passing wind  as for her moral views  they were  enough to make one shudder  she had got past the argumentative amours of  ibsen s idiotic  rebellious heroines  and had now reached the theory of  pure intangible beauty  she deemed santerre s last creation  anne marie   to be far too material and degraded  because in one deplorable passage  the author remarked that norbert s kisses had left their trace on the  countess s brow  santerre disputed the quotation  whereupon she rushed  upon the volume and sought the page to which she had referred      but i never degraded her   exclaimed the novelist in despair   she  never has a child       pooh  what of that   exclaimed valentine   if anne marie is to raise  our hearts she ought to be like spotless marble  and norbert s kisses  should leave no mark upon her      but she was interrupted  for celeste  the maid  a tall dark girl with an  equine head  big features  and a pleasant air  now came in with the two  children  gaston was at this time five years old  and lucie was three   both were slight and delicate  pale like roses blooming in the shade   like their mother  they were fair  the lad s hair was inclined to be  carroty  while that of the girl suggested the color of oats  and they  also had their mother s blue eyes  but their faces were elongated like  that of their father  dressed in white  with their locks curled  arrayed  indeed in the most coquettish style  they looked like big fragile dolls   the parents were touched in their worldly pride at sight of them  and  insisted on their playing their parts with due propriety      well  don t you wish anybody good evening      the children were not timid  they were already used to society and  looked visitors full in the face  if they made little haste  it was  because they were naturally indolent and did not care to obey  they at  last made up their minds and allowed themselves to be kissed      good evening  good friend santerre      then they hesitated before mathieu  and their father had to remind them  of the gentleman s name  though they had already seen him on two or  three occasions      good evening  monsieur froment      valentine took hold of them  sat them on her lap  and half stifled them  with caresses  she seemed to adore them  but as soon as she had sat them  down again she forgot all about them      so you are going out again  mamma   asked the little boy      why  yes  my darling  papas and mammas  you know  have their affairs to  see to       so we shall have dinner all alone  mamma      valentine did not answer  but turned towards the maid  who was waiting  for orders        you are not to leave them for a moment  celeste  you hear  and  above  all things  they are not to go into the kitchen  i can never come home  without finding them in the kitchen  it is exasperating  let them have  their dinner at seven  and put them to bed at nine  and see that they go  to sleep      the big girl with the equine head listened with an air of respectful  obedience  while her faint smile expressed the cunning of a norman  peasant who had been five years in paris already and was hardened to  service  and well knew what was done with children when the master and  mistress were absent      madame   she said in a simple way   mademoiselle lucie is poorly  she  has been sick again       what  sick again   cried the father in a fury   i am always hearing  of that  they are always being sick  and it always happens when we are  going out  it is very disagreeable  my dear  you might see to it  you  ought not to let our children have papier mache stomachs      the mother made an angry gesture  as if to say that she could not  help it  as a matter of fact  the children were often poorly  they had  experienced every childish ailment  they were always catching cold  or getting feverish  and they preserved the mute  moody  and somewhat  anxious demeanor of children who are abandoned to the care of servants      is it true you were poorly  my little lucie   asked valentine  stooping  down to the child   you aren t poorly now  are you  no  no  it s  nothing  nothing at all  kiss me  my pet  bid papa good night very  prettily  so that he may not feel worried in leaving you      she rose up  already tranquillized and gay again  and  noticing that  mathieu was looking at her  she exclaimed      ah  these little folks give one a deal of worry  but one loves them  dearly all the same  though  so far as there is happiness in life  it  would perhaps be better for them never to have been born  however  my  duty to the country is done  each wife ought to have a boy and a girl as  i have      thereupon mathieu  seeing that she was jesting  ventured to say with a  laugh      well  that isn t the opinion of your medical man  dr  boutan  he  declares that to make the country prosperous every married couple ought  to have four children       four children  he s mad   cried seguin  and again with the greatest  freedom of language he brought forward his pet theories  there was  a world of meaning in his wife s laughter while celeste stood there  unmoved and the children listened without understanding  but at last  santerre led the seguins away  it was only in the hall that mathieu  obtained from his landlord a promise that he would write to the plumber  at janville and that the roof of the pavilion should be entirely  renovated  since the rain came into the bedrooms     the seguins  landau was waiting at the door  when they had got into it  with their friend  it occurred to mathieu to raise his eyes  and at one  of the windows he perceived celeste standing between the two children   intent  no doubt  on assuring herself that monsieur and madame were  really going  the young man recalled reine s departure from her parents   but here both lucie and gaston remained motionless  gravely mournful   and neither their father nor their mother once thought of looking up at  them           iv    at half past seven o clock  when mathieu arrived at the restaurant on  the place de la madeleine where he was to meet his employer  he found  him already there  drinking a glass of madeira with his customer  m   firon badinier  the dinner was a remarkable one  choice viands and the  best wines were served in abundance  but mathieu was struck less by the  appetite which the others displayed than by beauchene s activity and  skill  glass in hand  never losing a bite  he had already persuaded  his customer  by the time the roast arrived  to order not only the new  thresher but also a mowing machine  m  firon badinier was to take the  train for evreux at nine twenty  and when nine o clock struck  the  other  now eager to be rid of him  contrived to pack him off in a cab to  the st  lazare railway station     for a moment beauchene remained standing on the pavement with mathieu   and took off his hat in order that the mild breezes of that delightful  may evening might cool his burning head      well  that s settled   he said with a laugh   but it wasn t so easily  managed  it was the pommard which induced the beggar to make up his  mind  all the same  i was dreadfully afraid he would make me miss my  appointment      these remarks  which escaped him amid his semi intoxication  led him to  more confidential talk  he put on his hat again  lighted a fresh  cigar  and took mathieu s arm  then they walked on slowly through the  passion stirred throng and the nightly blaze of the boulevards      there s plenty of time   said beauchene   i m not expected till  half past nine  and it s close by  will you have a cigar  no  you never  smoke       never       well  my dear fellow  it would be ridiculous to feign with you  since  you happened to see me this morning  oh  it s a stupid affair  i m quite  of that opinion  but  then  what would you have      thereupon he launched out into long explanations concerning his marital  life and the intrigue which had suddenly sprung up between him and that  girl norine  old moineaud s daughter  he professed the greatest respect  for his wife  but he was nevertheless a loose liver  and constance was  now beginning to resign herself to the inevitable  she closed her eyes  when it would have been unpleasant for her to keep them open  she  knew very well that it was essential that the business should be kept  together and pass intact into the hands of their son maurice  a tribe of  children would have meant the ruin of all their plans     mathieu listened at first in great astonishment  and then began to  ask questions and raise objections  at most of which beauchene laughed  gayly  like the gross egotist he was  he talked at length with extreme  volubility  going into all sorts of details  at times assuming a  semi apologetic manner  but more frequently justifying himself with an  air of triumph  and  finally  when they reached the corner of the  rue caumartin he halted to bid mathieu good by  he there had a little  bachelor s lodging  which was kept in order by the concierge of the  house  who  being very well paid  proved an extremely discreet domestic     as he hurried off  mathieu  still standing at the corner of the street   could not help thinking of the scenes which he had witnessed at the  beauchene works that day  he thought of old moineaud  the fitter  whom  he again saw standing silent and unmoved in the women s workroom while  his daughter euphrasie was being soundly rated by beauchene  and while  norine  the other girl  looked on with a sly laugh  when the toiler s  children have grown up and gone to join  the lads the army of slaughter   and the girls the army of vice  the father  degraded by the ills of  life  pays little heed to it all  to him it is seemingly a matter of  indifference to what disaster the wind may carry the fledgelings who  fall from the nest     it was now half past nine o clock  and mathieu had more than an hour  before him to reach the northern railway station  so he did not hurry   but strolled very leisurely up the boulevards  he had eaten and drunk  far more than usual  and beauchene s insidious confidential talk  still  buzzing in his ears  helped on his intoxication  his hands were hot   and now and again a sudden glow passed over his face  and what a warm  evening it was  too  on those boulevards  blazing with electric lights   fevered by a swarming  jostling throng  amid a ceaseless rumble of cabs  and omnibuses  it was all like a stream of ardent life flowing away into  the night  and mathieu allowed himself to be carried on by the torrent   whose hot breath  whose glow of passion  he ever felt sweeping over him     then  in a reverie  he pictured the day he had just spent  first he  was at the beauchenes  in the morning  and saw the father and mother  standing  like accomplices who fully shared one another s views  beside  the sofa on which maurice  their only son  lay dozing with a pale and  waxen face  the works must never be exposed to the danger of being  subdivided  maurice alone must inherit all the millions which the  business might yield  so that he might become one of the princes of  industry  and therefore the husband hurried off to sin while the wife  closed her eyes  in this sense  in defiance of morality and health   did the capitalist bourgeoisie  which had replaced the old nobility   virtually re establish the law of primogeniture  that law had been  abolished at the revolution for the bourgeoisie s benefit  but now  also  for its own purposes  it revived it  each family must have but one son     mathieu had reached this stage in his reflections when his thoughts were  diverted by several street hawkers who  in selling the last edition of  an evening print  announced a  drawing  of the lottery stock of some  enterprise launched by the credit national  and then he suddenly  recalled the moranges in their dining room  and heard them recapitulate  their dream of making a big fortune as soon as the accountant should  have secured a post in one of the big banking establishments  where the  principals raise men of value to the highest posts  those moranges lived  in everlasting dread of seeing their daughter marry a needy petty clerk   succumbing to that irresistible fever which  in a democracy ravaged by  political equality and economic inequality  impels every one to climb  higher up the social ladder  envy consumed them at the thought of  the luxury of others  they plunged into debt in order that they might  imitate from afar the elegance of the upper class  and all their natural  honesty and good nature was poisoned by the insanity born of ambitious  pride  and here again but one child was permissible  lest they should  be embarrassed  delayed  forever impeded in the attainment of the future  they coveted     a crowd of people now barred mathieu s way  and he perceived that he  was near the theatre  where a first performance was taking place that  evening  it was a theatre where free farcical pieces were produced  and  on its walls were posted huge portraits of its  star   a carroty wench  with a long flat figure  destitute of all womanliness  and seemingly  symbolical of perversity  passers by stopped to gaze at the bills  the  vilest remarks were heard  and mathieu remembered that the seguins and  santerre were inside the house  laughing at the piece  which was of so  filthy a nature that the spectators at the dress rehearsal  though they  were by no means over nice in such matters  had expressed their disgust  by almost wrecking the auditorium  and while the seguins were gloating  over this horror  yonder  at their house in the avenue d antin  celeste  had just put the children  gaston and lucie  to bed  and had then  hastily returned to the kitchen  where a friend  madame menoux  who kept  a little haberdasher s shop in the neighborhood  awaited her  gaston   having been given some wine to drink  was already asleep  but lucie  who  again felt sick  lay shivering in her bed  not daring to call celeste   lest the servant  who did not like to be disturbed  should ill treat  her  and  at two o clock in the morning  after offering santerre an  oyster supper at a night restaurant  the seguins would come home  their  minds unhinged by the imbecile literature and art to which they had  taken for fashion s sake  vitiated yet more by the ignoble performance  they had witnessed  and the base society they had elbowed at supper   they seemed to typify vice for vice s sake  elegant vice and pessimism  as a principle     indeed  when mathieu tried to sum up his day  he found vice on every  side  in each of the spheres with which he had come in contact  and now  the examples he had witnessed filled him no longer with mere surprise   they disturbed him  they shook his beliefs  they made him doubt  whether his notions of life  duty  and happiness might not after all be  inaccurate     he stopped short and drew a long breath  seeking to drive away his  growing intoxication  he had passed the grand opera and was reaching  the crossway of the rue drouot  perhaps his increase of fever was due  to those glowing boulevards  the private rooms of the restaurants were  still ablaze  the cafes threw bright radiance across the road  the  pavement was blocked by their tables and chairs and customers  all paris  seemed to have come down thither to enjoy that delightful evening  there  was endless elbowing  endless mingling of breath as the swelling crowd  sauntered along  couples lingered before the sparkling displays of  jewellers  shops  middle class families swept under dazzling arches  of electric lamps into cafes concerts  whose huge posters promised  the grossest amusements  hundreds and hundreds of women went by with  trailing skirts  and whispered and jested and laughed  while men darted  in pursuit  now of a fair chignon  now of a dark one  in the open  cabs men and women sat side by side  now husbands and wives long since  married  now chance couples who had met but an hour ago  but mathieu  went on again  yielding to the force of the current  carried along  like all the others  a prey to the same fever which sprang from the  surroundings  from the excitement of the day  from the customs of the  age  and he no longer took the beauchenes  the moranges  the seguins as  isolated types  it was all paris that symbolized vice  all paris that  yielded to debauchery and sank into degradation  there were the folks of  high culture  the folks suffering from literary neurosis  there were  the merchant princes  there were the men of liberal professions  the  lawyers  the doctors  the engineers  there were the people of the lower  middle class  the petty tradesmen  the petty clerks  there were even  the manual workers  poisoned by the example of the upper spheres  all  practising the doctrines of egotism as vanity and the passion for money  grew more and more intense      no more children  paris was bent on  dying  and mathieu recalled how napoleon i   one evening after battle   on beholding a plain strewn with the corpses of his soldiers  had put  his trust in paris to repair the carnage of that day  but times  had changed  paris would no longer supply life  whether it were for  slaughter or for toil     and as mathieu thought of it all a sudden weakness came upon him  again  he asked himself whether the beauchenes  the moranges  the seguins  and  all those thousands and thousands around him were not right  and whether  he were not the fool  the dupe  the criminal  with his belief in life  ever renascent  ever growing and spreading throughout the world  and  before him arose  too  the image of seraphine  the temptress  opening  her perfumed arms to him and carrying him off to the same existence of  pleasure and baseness which the others led     then he remembered the three hundred francs which he carried in his  pocket  three hundred francs  which must last for a whole month  though  out of them he had to pay various little sums that he already owed  the  remainder would barely suffice to buy a ribbon for marianne and jam  for the youngsters  bread  and if he set the moranges on one side  the  others  the beauchenes and the seguins  were rich  he bitterly recalled  their wealth  he pictured the rumbling factory with its black buildings  covering a great stretch of ground  he pictured hundreds of workmen  ever increasing the fortune of their master  who dwelt in a handsomely  appointed pavilion and whose only son was growing up for future  sovereignty  under his mother s vigilant eyes  he pictured  too  the  seguins  luxurious mansion in the avenue d antin  the great hall  the  magnificent staircase  the vast room above  crowded with marvels  he  pictured all the refinement  all the train of wealth  all the tokens of  lavish life  the big dowry which would be given to the little girl  the  high position which would be purchased for the son  and he  bare and  empty handed  who now possessed nothing  not even a stone at the edge of  a field  would doubtless always possess nothing  neither factory buzzing  with workmen  nor mansion rearing its proud front aloft  and he was the  imprudent one  and the others were the sensible  the wise  what would  ever become of himself and his troop of children  would he not die in  some garret  would they not lead lives of abject wretchedness  ah  it  was evident the others were right  the others were sensible  and he felt  unhinged  he regarded himself with contempt  like a fool who has allowed  himself to be duped     then once more the image of seraphine arose before his eyes  more  tempting than ever  a slight quiver came upon him as he beheld the blaze  of the northern railway station and all the feverish traffic around  it  wild fancies surged through his brain  he thought of beauchene   why should he not do likewise  he recalled past times  and  yielding to  sudden madness  turned his back upon the station and retraced his steps  towards the boulevards  seraphine  he said to himself  was doubtless  waiting for him  she had told him that he would always be welcome  as  for his wife  he would tell her he had missed his train     at last a block in the traffic made him pause  and on raising his eyes  he saw that he had reached the boulevards once more  the crowd still  streamed along  but with increased feverishness  mathieu s temples were  beating  and wild words escaped his lips  why should he not live the  same life as the others  he was ready  even eager  to plunge into it   but the block in the traffic continued  he could not cross the road  and  while he stood there hesitation and doubt came upon him  he saw in that  increasing obstruction a deliberate obstacle to his wild design  and all  at once the image of seraphine faded from before his mind s eye and  he beheld another  his wife  his dear wife marianne  awaiting him  all  smiles and trustfulness  in the fresh quietude of the country  could  he deceive her      then all at once he again rushed off towards  the railway station  in fear lest he should lose his train  he was  determined that he would listen to no further promptings  that he would  cast no further glance upon glowing  dissolute paris  and he reached  the station just in time to climb into a car  the train started and he  journeyed on  leaning out of his compartment and offering his face to  the cool night breeze in order that it might calm and carry off the evil  fever that had possessed him     the night was moonless  but studded with such pure and such glowing  stars that the country could be seen spreading far away beneath a soft  bluish radiance  already at twenty minutes past eleven marianne  found herself on the little bridge crossing the yeuse  midway between  chantebled  the pavilion where she and her husband lived  and the  station of janville  the children were fast asleep  she had left them  in the charge of zoe  the servant  who sat knitting beside a lamp  the  light of which could be seen from afar  showing like a bright spark amid  the black line of the woods     whenever mathieu returned home by the seven o clock train  as was his  wont  marianne came to meet him at the bridge  occasionally she brought  her two eldest boys  the twins  with her  though their little legs  moved but slowly on the return journey when  in retracing their steps   a thousand yards or more  they had to climb a rather steep hillside   and that evening  late though the hour was  marianne had yielded to  that pleasant habit of hers  enjoying the delight of thus going forward  through the lovely night to meet the man she worshipped  she never went  further than the bridge which arched over the narrow river  she seated  herself on its broad  low parapet  as on some rustic bench  and thence  she overlooked the whole plain as far as the houses of janville  before  which passed the railway line  and from afar she could see her husband  approaching along the road which wound between the cornfields     that evening she took her usual seat under the broad velvety sky  spangled with gold  and with a movement which bespoke her solicitude  she turned towards the bright little light shining on the verge of the  sombre woods  a light telling of the quietude of the room in which  it burnt  the servant s tranquil vigil  and the happy slumber of the  children in the adjoining chamber  then marianne let her gaze wander  all around her  over the great estate of chantebled  belonging to the  seguins  the dilapidated pavilion stood at the extreme edge of the  woods whose copses  intersected by patches of heath  spread over a lofty  plateau to the distant farms of mareuil and lillebonne  but that was not  all  for to the west of the plateau lay more than two hundred and fifty  acres of land  a marshy expanse where pools stagnated amid brushwood   vast uncultivated tracts  where one went duck shooting in winter  and  there was yet a third part of the estate  acres upon acres of equally  sterile soil  all sand and gravel  descending in a gentle slope to the  embankment of the railway line  it was indeed a stretch of country lost  to culture  where the few good patches of loam remained unproductive   inclosed within the waste land  but the spot had all the beauty and  exquisite wildness of solitude  and was one that appealed to healthy  minds fond of seeing nature in freedom  and on that lovely night one  could nowhere have found more perfect and more balmy quiet     marianne  who since coming to the district had already threaded the  woodland paths  explored the stretches of brushwood around the meres   and descended the pebbly slopes  let her eyes travel slowly over the  expanse  divining spots she had visited and was fond of  though the  darkness now prevented her from seeing them  in the depths of the woods  an owl raised its soft  regular cry  while from a pond on the right  ascended a faint croaking of frogs  so far away that it sounded like the  vibration of crystal  and from the other side  the side of paris  there  came a growing rumble which  little by little  rose above all the other  sounds of the night  she heard it  and at last lent ear to nothing else   it was the train  for whose familiar roar she waited every evening  as  soon as it left monval station on its way to janville  it gave token of  its coming  but so faintly that only a practised ear could distinguish  its rumble amid the other sounds rising from the country side  for  her part  she heard it immediately  and thereupon followed it in fancy  through every phase of its journey  and never had she been better able  to do so than on that splendid night  amid the profound quietude of  the earth s slumber  it had left monval  it was turning beside the  brickworks  it was skirting st  george s fields  in another two minutes  it would be at janville  then all at once its white light shone out  beyond the poplar trees of le mesnil rouge  and the panting of the  engine grew louder  like that of some giant racer drawing near  on that  side the plain spread far away into a dark  unknown region  beneath the  star spangled sky  which on the very horizon showed a ruddy reflection  like that of some brasier  the reflection of nocturnal paris  blazing  and smoking in the darkness like a volcano     marianne sprang to her feet  the train stopped at janville  and then  its rumble rose again  grew fainter  and died away in the direction of  vieux bourg  but she no longer paid attention to it  she now had eyes  and ears only for the road which wound like a pale ribbon between the  dark patches of corn  her husband did not take ten minutes to cover  the thousand yards and more which separated the station from the little  bridge  and  as a rule  she perceived and recognized him far off  but  on that particular night  such was the deep silence that she could  distinguish his footfall on the echoing road long before his dark  slim  figure showed against the pale ground  and he found her there  erect  under the stars  smiling and healthy  a picture of all that is good  the  milky whiteness of her skin was accentuated by her beautiful black hair   caught up in a huge coil  and her big black eyes  which beamed with all  the gentleness of spouse and mother  her straight brow  her nose  her  mouth  her chin so boldly  purely rounded  her cheeks which glowed like  savory fruit  her delightful little ears  the whole of her face  full  of love and tenderness  bespoke beauty in full health  the gayety which  comes from the accomplishment of duty  and the serene conviction that by  loving life she would live as she ought to live      what  so you ve come then   mathieu exclaimed  as soon as he was near  her   but i begged you not to come out so late  are you not afraid at  being alone on the roads at this time of night      she began to laugh   afraid   said she   when the night is so mild and  healthful  besides  wouldn t you rather have me here to kiss you ten  minutes sooner      those simple words brought tears to mathieu s eyes  all the murkiness   all the shame through which he had passed in paris horrified him  he  tenderly took his wife in his arms  and they exchanged the closest  the  most human of kisses amid the quiet of the slumbering fields  after the  scorching pavement of paris  after the eager struggling of the day  and the degrading spectacles of the night  how reposeful was that  far spreading silence  that faint bluish radiance  that endless  unrolling of plains  steeped in refreshing gloom and dreaming of  fructification by the morrow s sun  and what suggestions of health  and  rectitude  and felicity rose from productive nature  who fell asleep  beneath the dew of night solely that she might reawaken in triumph  ever  and ever rejuvenated by life s torrent  which streams even through the  dust of her paths     mathieu slowly seated marianne on the low broad parapet once more  he  kept her near his heart  it was a halt full of affection  which neither  could forego  in presence of the universal peace that came to them from  the stars  and the waters  and the woods  and the endless fields      what a splendid night   murmured mathieu   how beautiful and how  pleasant to live in it      then  after a moment s rapture  during which they both heard their  hearts beating  he began to tell her of his day  she questioned him with  loving interest  and he answered  happy at having to tell her no lie      no  the beauchenes cannot come here on sunday  constance never cared  much for us  as you well know  their boy maurice is suffering in the  legs  dr  boutan was there  and the question of children was discussed  again  i will tell you all about that  on the other hand  the moranges  have promised to come  you can t have an idea of the delight and vanity  they displayed in showing me their new flat  what with their eagerness  to make a big fortune i m much afraid that those worthy folks will do  something very foolish  oh  i was forgetting  i called on the landlord   and though i had a good deal of difficulty over it  he ended by  consenting to have the roof entirely relaid  ah  what a home  too  those  seguins have  i came away feeling quite scared  but i will tell you all  about it by and by with the rest      marianne evinced no loquacious curiosity  she quietly awaited his  confidences  and showed anxiety only respecting themselves and the  children      you received your salary  didn t you   she asked      yes  yes  you need not be afraid about that       oh  i m not afraid  it s only our little debts which worry me      then she asked again   and did your business dinner go off all right   i was afraid that beauchene might detain you and make you miss your  train      he replied that everything had gone off properly  but as he spoke he  flushed and felt a pang at his heart  to rid himself of his emotion he  affected sudden gayety      well  and you  my dear   he asked   how did you manage with your thirty  sous       my thirty sous   she gayly responded   why  i was much too rich  we  fared like princes  all five of us  and i have six sous left      then  in her turn  she gave an account of her day  her daily life  pure  as crystal  she recapitulated what she had done  what she had said  she  related how the children had behaved  and she entered into the minutest  details respecting them and the house  with her  moreover  one day was  like another  each morning she set herself to live the same life afresh   with never failing happiness      to day  though  we had a visit   said she   madame lepailleur  the  woman from the mill over yonder  came to tell me that she had some fine  chickens for sale  as we owe her twelve francs for eggs and milk  i  believe that she simply called to see if i meant to pay her  i told her  that i would go to her place to morrow      while speaking marianne had pointed through the gloom towards a big  black pile  a little way down the yeuse  it was an old water mill which  was still worked  and the lepailleurs had now been installed in it for  three generations  the last of them  francois lepailleur  who considered  himself to be no fool  had come back from his military service with  little inclination to work  and an idea that the mill would never enrich  him  any more than it had enriched his father and grandfather  it then  occurred to him to marry a peasant farmer s daughter  victoire cornu   whose dowry consisted of some neighboring fields skirting the yeuse   and the young couple then lived fairly at their ease  on the produce of  those fields and such small quantities of corn as the peasants of the  district still brought to be ground at the old mill  if the antiquated  and badly repaired mechanism of the mill had been replaced by modern  appliances  and if the land  instead of being impoverished by adherence  to old fashioned practices  had fallen into the hands of an intelligent  man who believed in progress  there would no doubt have been a fortune  in it all  but lepailleur was not only disgusted with work  he treated  the soil with contempt  he indeed typified the peasant who has grown  weary of his eternal mistress  the mistress whom his forefathers loved  too much  remembering that  in spite of all their efforts to fertilize  the soil  it had never made them rich or happy  he had ended by hating  it  all his faith in its powers had departed  he accused it of having  lost its fertility  of being used up and decrepit  like some old  cow which one sends to the slaughter house  and  according to him   everything went wrong  the soil simply devoured the seed sown in it  the  weather was never such as it should be  the seasons no longer came in  their proper order  briefly  it was all a premeditated disaster brought  about by some evil power which had a spite against the peasantry  who  were foolish to give their sweat and their blood to such a thankless  creature      madame lepailleur brought her boy with her  a little fellow three  years old  called antonin   resumed marianne   and we fell to talking of  children together  she quite surprised me  peasant folks  you know  used  to have such large families  but she declared that one child was  quite enough  yet she s only twenty four  and her husband not yet  twenty seven      these remarks revived the thoughts which had filled mathieu s mind all  day  for a moment he remained silent  then he said   she gave you her  reasons  no doubt       give reasons  she  with her head like a horse s  her long freckled  face  pale eyes  and tight  miserly mouth  i think she s simply a fool   ever in admiration before her husband because he fought in africa and  reads the newspapers  all that i could get out of her was that children  cost one a good deal more than they bring in  but the husband  no doubt   has ideas of his own  you have seen him  haven t you  a tall  slim  fellow  as carroty and as scraggy as his wife  with an angular face   green eyes  and prominent cheekbones  he looks as though he had never  felt in a good humor in his life  and i understand that he is always  complaining of his father in law  because the other had three daughters  and a son  of course that cut down his wife s dowry  she inherited only  a part of her father s property  and  besides  as the trade of a miller  never enriched his father  lepailleur curses his mill from morning till  night  and declares that he won t prevent his boy antonin from going  to eat white bread in paris  if he can find a good berth there when he  grows up      thus  even among the country folks  mathieu found a small family  the rule  among the causes were the fear of having to split up an  inheritance  the desire to rise in the social system  the disgust of  manual toil  and the thirst for the luxuries of town life  since the  soil was becoming bankrupt  why indeed continue tilling it  when one  knew that one would never grow rich by doing so  mathieu was on the  point of explaining these things to his wife  but he hesitated  and then  simply said   lepailleur does wrong to complain  he has two cows and a  horse  and when there is urgent work he can take an assistant  we  this  morning  had just thirty sous belonging to us  and we own no mill  no  scrap of land  for my part i think his mill superb  i envy him every  time i cross this bridge  just fancy  we two being the millers  why  we  should be very rich and very happy      this made them both laugh  and for another moment they remained seated  there  watching the dark massive mill beside the yeuse  between the  willows and poplars on both banks the little river flowed on peacefully   scarce murmuring as it coursed among the water plants which made it  ripple  then  amid a clump of oaks  appeared the big shed sheltering  the wheel  and the other buildings garlanded with ivy  honeysuckle  and  creepers  the whole forming a spot of romantic prettiness  and at night   especially when the mill slept  without a light at any of its windows   there was nothing of more dreamy  more gentle charm      why   remarked mathieu  lowering his voice   there is somebody under  the willows  beside the water  i heard a slight noise       yes  i know   replied marianne with tender gayety   it must be the  young couple who settled themselves in the little house yonder a  fortnight ago  you know whom i mean  madame angelin  that schoolmate of  constance s      the angelins  who had become their neighbors  interested the froments   the wife was of the same age as marianne  tall  dark  with fine hair  and fine eyes  radiant with continual joy  and fond of pleasure  and the  husband was of the same age as mathieu  a handsome fellow  very much in  love  with moustaches waving in the wind  and the joyous spirits of a  musketeer  they had married with sudden passion for one another  having  between them an income of some ten thousand francs a year  which the  husband  a fan painter with a pretty talent  might have doubled had it  not been for the spirit of amorous idleness into which his marriage had  thrown him  and that spring time they had sought a refuge in that desert  of janville  that they might love freely  passionately  in the midst of  nature  they were always to be met  holding each other by the waist   on the secluded paths in the woods  and at night they loved to stroll  across the fields  beside the hedges  along the shady banks of the  yeuse  delighted when they could linger till very late near the  murmuring water  in the thick shade of the willows     but there was quite another side to their idyl  and marianne mentioned  it to her husband  she had chatted with madame angelin  and it appeared  that the latter wished to enjoy life  at all events for the present   and did not desire to be burdened with children  then mathieu s worrying  thoughts once more came back to him  and again at this fresh example  he wondered who was right  he who stood alone in his belief  or all the  others      well   he muttered at last   we all live according to our fancy  but  come  my dear  let us go in  we disturb them      they slowly climbed the narrow road leading to chantebled  where the  lamp shone out like a beacon  when mathieu had bolted the front door  they groped their way upstairs  the ground floor of their little house  comprised a dining room and a drawing room on the right hand of the  hall  and a kitchen and a store place on the left  upstairs there were  four bedrooms  their scanty furniture seemed quite lost in those big  rooms  but  exempt from vanity as they were  they merely laughed at  this  by way of luxury they had simply hung some little curtains of  red stuff at the windows  and the ruddy reflection from these hangings  seemed to them to impart wonderfully rich cheerfulness to their home     they found zoe  their peasant servant  asleep over her knitting beside  the lamp in their own bedroom  and they had to wake her and send her as  quietly as possible to bed  then mathieu took up the lamp and  entered the children s room to kiss them and make sure that they were  comfortable  it was seldom they awoke on these occasions  having placed  the lamp on the mantelshelf  he still stood there looking at the three  little beds when marianne joined him  in the bed against the wall at one  end of the room lay blaise and denis  the twins  sturdy little fellows  six years of age  while in the second bed against the opposite wall was  ambroise  now nearly four and quite a little cherub  and the third bed   a cradle  was occupied by mademoiselle rose  fifteen months of age and  weaned for three weeks past  she lay there half naked  showing her white  flowerlike skin  and her mother had to cover her up with the bedclothes   which she had thrust aside with her self willed little fists  meantime  the father busied himself with ambroise s pillow  which had slipped  aside  both husband and wife came and went very gently  and bent again  and again over the children s faces to make sure that they were sleeping  peacefully  they kissed them and lingered yet a little longer  fancying  that they had heard blaise and denis stirring  at last the mother took  up the lamp and they went off  one after the other  on tiptoe     when they were in their room again marianne exclaimed   i didn t want to  worry you while we were out  but rose made me feel anxious to day  i did  not find her well  and it was only this evening that i felt more at ease  about her   then  seeing that mathieu started and turned pale  she went  on   oh  it was nothing  i should not have gone out if i had felt the  least fear for her  but with those little folks one is never free from  anxiety      she then began to make her preparations for the night  but mathieu   instead of imitating her  sat down at the table where the lamp stood   and drew the money paid to him by morange from his pocket  when he had  counted those three hundred francs  those fifteen louis  he said in a  bitter  jesting way   the money hasn t grown on the road  here it is   you can pay our debts to morrow      this remark gave him a fresh idea  taking his pencil he began to jot  down the various amounts they owed on a blank page of his pocket diary    we say twelve francs to the lepailleurs for eggs and milk  how much do  you owe the butcher   he asked      the butcher   replied marianne  who had sat down to take off her shoes    well  say twenty francs       and the grocer and the baker       i don t know exactly  but about thirty francs altogether  there is  nobody else      then mathieu added up the items   that makes sixty two francs   said he    take them away from three hundred  and we shall have two hundred and  thirty eight left  eight francs a day at the utmost  well  we have a  nice month before us  with our four children to feed  particularly if  little rose should fall ill      the remark surprised his wife  who laughed gayly and confidently   saying   why  what is the matter with you to night  my dear  you seem to  be almost in despair  when as a rule you look forward to the morrow as  full of promise  you have often said that it was sufficient to love life  if one wished to live happily  as for me  you know  with you and the  little ones i feel the happiest  richest woman in the world      at this mathieu could restrain himself no longer  he shook his head and  mournfully began to recapitulate the day he had just spent  at great  length he relieved his long pent up feelings  he spoke of their poverty  and the prosperity of others  he spoke of the beauchenes  the moranges   the seguins  the lepailleurs  of all he had seen of them  of all they  had said  of all their scarcely disguised contempt for an improvident  starveling like himself  he  mathieu  and she  marianne  would never  have factory  nor mansion  nor mill  nor an income of twelve thousand  francs a year  and their increasing penury  as the others said  had  been their own work  they had certainly shown themselves imprudent   improvident  and he went on with his recollections  telling marianne  that he feared nothing for himself  but that he did not wish to condemn  her and the little ones to want and poverty  she was surprised at first   and by degrees became colder  more constrained  as he told her all that  he had upon his mind  tears slowly welled into her eyes  and at last   however lovingly he spoke  she could no longer restrain herself  but  burst into sobs  she did not question what he said  she spoke no words  of revolt  but it was evident that her whole being rebelled  and that  her heart was sorely grieved     he started  greatly troubled when he saw her tears  something akin to  her own feelings came upon him  he was terribly distressed  angry with  himself   do not weep  my darling   he exclaimed as he pressed her to  him   it was stupid  brutal  and wrong of me to speak to you in that  way  don t distress yourself  i beg you  we ll think it all over and  talk about it some other time      she ceased to weep  but she continued silent  clinging to him  with her  head resting on his shoulder  and mathieu  by the side of that loving   trustful woman  all health and rectitude and purity  felt more and more  confused  more and more ashamed of himself  ashamed of having given heed  to the base  sordid  calculating principles which others made the basis  of their lives  he thought with loathing of the sudden frenzy which had  possessed him during the evening in paris  some poison must have been  instilled into his veins  he could not recognize himself  but honor  and rectitude  clear sightedness and trustfulness in life were fast  returning  through the window  which had remained open  all the sounds  of the lovely spring night poured into the room  it was spring  the  season of love  and beneath the palpitating stars in the broad heavens   from fields and forests and waters came the murmur of germinating  life  and never had mathieu more fully realized that  whatever loss may  result  whatever difficulty may arise  whatever fate may be in store   all the creative powers of the world  whether of the animal order   whether of the order of the plants  for ever and ever wage life s great  incessant battle against death  man alone  dissolute and diseased among  all the other denizens of the world  all the healthful forces of nature   seeks death for death s sake  the annihilation of his species  then  mathieu again caught his wife in a close embrace  printing on her lips a  long  ardent kiss      ah  dear heart  forgive me  i doubted both of us  it would be  impossible for either of us to sleep unless you forgive me  well  let  the others hold us in derision and contempt if they choose  let us love  and live as nature tells us  for you are right  therein lies true wisdom  and true courage            v    mathieu rose noiselessly from his little folding iron bedstead beside  the large one of mahogany  on which marianne lay alone  he looked at  her  and saw that she was awake and smiling      what  you are not asleep   said he   i hardly dared to stir for fear of  waking you  it is nearly nine o clock  you know      it was sunday morning  january had come round  and they were in paris   during the first fortnight in december the weather had proved frightful  at chantebled  icy rains being followed by snow and terrible cold  this  rigorous temperature  coupled with the circumstance that marianne was  again expecting to become a mother  had finally induced mathieu to  accept beauchene s amiable offer to place at his disposal the little  pavilion in the rue de la federation  where the founder of the works had  lived before building the superb house on the quay  an old foreman who  had occupied this pavilion  which still contained the simple furniture  of former days  had lately died  and the young folks  desiring to be  near their friend  worthy dr  boutan  had lived there for a month now   and did not intend to return to chantebled until the first fine days in  april      wait a moment   resumed mathieu   i will let the light in      he thereupon drew back one of the curtains  and a broad ray of yellow   wintry sunshine illumined the dim room   ah  there s the sun  and it s  splendid weather  and sunday too  i shall be able to take you out for a  little while with the children this afternoon      then marianne called him to her  and  when he had seated himself on the  bed  took hold of his hand and said gayly   well  i hadn t been sleeping  either for the last twenty minutes  and i didn t move because i wanted  you to lie in bed a little late  as it s sunday  how amusing to think  that we were afraid of waking one another when we both had our eyes wide  open       oh   said he   i was so happy to think you were sleeping  my one  delight on sundays now is to remain in this room all the morning  and  spend the whole day with you and the children   then he uttered a cry of  surprise and remorse   why  i haven t kissed you yet      she had raised herself on her pillows  and he gave her an eager clasp   in the stream of bright sunshine which gilded the bed she herself looked  radiant with health and strength and hope  never had her heavy brown  tresses flowed down more abundantly  never had her big eyes smiled with  gayer courage  and sturdy and healthful as she was  with her face  all kindliness and love  she looked like the very personification of  fruitfulness  the good goddess with dazzling skin and perfect flesh  of  sovereign dignity     they remained for a moment clasped together in the golden sunshine which  enveloped them with radiance  then mathieu pulled up marianne s pillows   set the counterpane in order  and forbade her to stir until he had  tidied the room  forthwith he stripped his little bedstead  folded up  the sheets  the mattress  and the bedstead itself  over which he slipped  a cover  she vainly begged him not to trouble  saying that zoe  the  servant whom they had brought from the country  could very well do all  those things  but he persisted  replying that the servant plagued him   and that he preferred to be alone to attend her and do all that there  was to do  then  as he suddenly began to shiver  he remarked that the  room was cold  and blamed himself for not having already lighted the  fire  some logs and some small wood were piled in a corner  near the  chimney piece      how stupid of me   he exclaimed   here am i leaving you to freeze      then he knelt down before the fireplace  while she protested   what an  idea  leave all that  and call zoe       no  no  she doesn t know how to light the fire properly  and besides   it amuses me      he laughed triumphantly when a bright clear fire began to crackle   filling the room with additional cheerfulness  the place was now a  little paradise  said he  but he had scarcely finished washing and  dressing when the partition behind the bed was shaken by a vigorous  thumping      ah  the rascals   he gayly exclaimed   they are awake  you see  oh   well  we may let them come  since to day is sunday      for a few moments there had been a noise as of an aviary in commotion  in the adjoining room  prattling  shrill chirping  and ringing bursts  of laughter could be heard  then came a noise as of pillows and bolsters  flying about  while two little fists continued pummelling the partition  as if it were a drum      yes  yes   said the mother  smiling and anxious   answer them  tell  them to come  they will be breaking everything if you don t      thereupon the father himself struck the wall  at which a victorious  outburst  cries of triumphal delight  arose on the other side  and  mathieu scarcely had time to open the door before tramping and scuffling  could be heard in the passage  a triumphal entry followed  all four of  them wore long nightdresses falling to their little bare feet  and they  trotted along and laughed  with their brown hair streaming about  their  faces quite pink  and their eyes radiant with candid delight  ambroise   though he was younger than his brothers  marched first  for he was the  boldest and most enterprising  behind him came the twins  blaise and  denis  who were less turbulent  the latter especially  he taught the  others to read  while blaise  who was rather shy and timid  remained the  dreamer of them all  and each gave a hand to little mademoiselle rose   who looked like an angel  pulled now to the right and now to the left  amid bursts of laughter  while she contrived to keep herself steadily  erect      ah  mamma   cried ambroise   it s dreadfully cold  you know  do make me  a little room      forthwith he bounded into the bed  slipped under the coverlet  and  nestled close to his mother  so that only his laughing face and fine  curly hair could be seen  but at this the two others raised a shout of  war  and rushed forward in their turn upon the besieged citadel      make a little room for us  mamma  make a little room  by your back   mamma  near your shoulder  mamma      only little rose remained on the floor  feeling quite vexed and  indignant  she had vainly attempted the assault  but had fallen back    and me  mamma  and me   she pleaded     it was necessary to help her in her endeavors to hoist herself up with  her little hands  then her mother took her in her arms in order that  she might have the best place of all  mathieu had at first felt somewhat  anxious at seeing marianne thus disturbed  but she laughed and told him  not to trouble  and then the picture they all presented as they nestled  there was so charming  so full of gayety  that he also smiled      it s very nice  it s so warm   said ambroise  who was fond of taking  his ease     but denis  the reasonable member of the band  began to explain why it  was they had made so much noise  blaise said that he had seen a spider   and then he felt frightened      this accusation of cowardice vexed his brother  who replied   it isn t  true  i did see a spider  but i threw my pillow at it to kill it       so did i  so did i   stammered rose  again laughing wildly   i threw my  pillow like that  houp  houp      they all roared and wriggled again  so amusing did it seem to them   the truth was that they had engaged in a pillow fight under pretence  of killing a spider  which blaise alone said that he had seen  this  unsupported testimony left the matter rather doubtful  but the whole  brood looked so healthful and fresh in the bright sunshine that their  father could not resist taking them in his arms  and kissing them here  and there  wherever his lips lighted  a final game which sent them into  perfect rapture amid a fresh explosion of laughter and shouts      oh  what fun  what fun       all the same   marianne exclaimed  as she succeeded in freeing herself  somewhat from the embraces of the children   all the same  you know  i  want to get up  i mustn t idle  for it does me no good  and besides  you  little ones need to be washed and dressed      they dressed in front of the big blazing fire  and it was nearly ten  o clock when they at last went down into the dining room  where the  earthenware stove was roaring  while the warm breakfast milk steamed  upon the table  the ground floor of the pavilion comprised a dining room  and a drawing room on the right of the hall  and a kitchen and a study  on the left  the dining room  like the principal bedchamber  overlooked  the rue de la federation  and was filled every morning with cheerfulness  by the rising sun     the children were already at table  with their noses in their cups  when  a ring at the street door was heard  and it was dr  boutan who came in   his arrival brought a renewal of noisy mirth  for the youngsters were  fond of his round  good natured face  he had attended them all at their  births  and treated them like an old friend  with whom familiarity is  allowable  and so they were already thrusting back their chairs to dart  towards the doctor  when a remark from their mother restrained them      now  please just leave the doctor quiet   said she  adding gayly   good  morning  doctor  i m much obliged to you for this bright sunshine  for  i m sure you ordered it so that i might go for a walk this afternoon       why  yes  of course i ordered it  i was passing this way  and thought i  would look in to see how you were getting on      boutan took a chair and seated himself near the table  while mathieu  explained to him that they had remained late in bed      yes  that is all right  let her rest  but she must also take as much  exercise as possible  however  there is no cause to worry  i see that  she has a good appetite  when i find my patients at table  i cease to be  a doctor  you know  i am simply a friend making a call      then he put a few questions  which the children  who were busy  breakfasting  did not hear  and afterwards there came a pause in the  conversation  which the doctor himself resumed  following  no doubt   some train of thought which he did not explain   i hear that you are to  lunch with the seguins next thursday   said he   ah  poor little woman   that is a terrible affair of hers      with a gesture he expressed his feelings concerning the drama that had  just upset the seguins  household  valentine  like marianne  was to  become a mother  for her part she was in despair at it  and her husband  had given way to jealous fury  for a time  amid all their quarrels  they  had continued leading their usual life of pleasure  but she now spent  her days on a couch  while he neglected her and reverted to a bachelor s  life  it was a very painful story  but the doctor was in hopes that  marianne  on the occasion of her visit to the seguins  might bring some  good influence to bear on them     he rose from his chair and was about to retire  when the attack which  had all along threatened him burst forth  the children  unsuspectedly  rising from their chairs  had concerted together with a glance  and  now they opened their campaign  the worthy doctor all at once found the  twins upon his shoulders  while the younger boy clasped him round the  waist and the little girl clung to his legs      puff  puff  do the railway train  do the railway train  please do      they pushed and shook him  amid peal after peal of flute like laughter   while their father and mother rushed to his assistance  scolding and  angry  but he calmed the parents by saying   let them be  they are  simply wishing me good day  and besides  i must bear with them  you  know  since  as our friend beauchene says  it is a little bit my fault  if they are in the world  what charms me with your children is that they  enjoy such good health  just like their mother  for the present  at all  events  one can ask nothing more of them      when he had set them down on the floor  and given each a smacking kiss   he took hold of marianne s hands and said to her that everything was  going on beautifully  and that he was very pleased  then he went off   escorted to the front door by mathieu  the pair of them jesting and  laughing gayly     directly after the midday meal mathieu wished to go out  in order that  marianne might profit by the bright sunshine  the children had been  dressed in readiness before sitting down to table  and it was scarcely  more than one o clock when the family turned the corner of the rue de la  federation and found itself upon the quays     this portion of grenelle  lying between the champ de mars and the  densely populated streets of the centre of the district  has an aspect  all its own  characterized by vast bare expanses  and long and almost  deserted streets running at right angles and fringed by factories with  lofty  interminable gray walls  during work hours nobody passes along  these streets  and on raising one s head one sees only lofty chimneys  belching forth thick coal smoke above the roofs of big buildings with  dusty window panes  and if any large cart entrance happens to be open  one may espy deep yards crowded with drays and full of acrid vapor  the  only sounds are the strident puffs of jets of steam  the dull rumbling  of machinery  and the sudden rattle of ironwork lowered from the carts  to the pavement  but on sundays the factories do not work  and the  district then falls into death like silence  in summer time there is but  bright sunshine heating the pavement  in winter some icy snow laden wind  rushing down the lonely streets  the population of grenelle is said to  be the worst of paris  both the most vicious and the most wretched   the neighborhood of the ecole militaire attracts thither a swarm of  worthless women  who bring in their train all the scum of the populace   in contrast to all this the gay bourgeois district of passy rises up  across the seine  while the rich aristocratic quarters of the invalides  and the faubourg st  germain spread out close by  thus the beauchene  works on the quay  as their owner laughingly said  turned their back  upon misery and looked towards all the prosperity and gayety of this  world     mathieu was very partial to the avenues  planted with fine trees   which radiate from the champ de mars and the esplanade des invalides   supplying great gaps for air and sunlight  but he was particularly fond  of that long diversified quai d orsay  which starts from the rue du  bac in the very centre of the city  passes before the palais bourbon   crosses first the esplanade des invalides  and then the champ de mars   to end at the boulevard de grenelle  in the black factory region  how  majestically it spread out  what fine old leafy trees there were round  that bend of the seine from the state tobacco works to the garden of  the eiffel tower  the river winds along with sovereign gracefulness  the  avenue stretches out under superb foliage  you can really saunter there  amid delicious quietude  instinct as it were with all the charm and  power of paris     it was thither that mathieu wished to take his wife and the little ones  that sunday  but the distance was considerable  and some anxiety was  felt respecting rose s little legs  she was intrusted to ambroise  who   although the youngest of the boys  was already energetic and determined   these two opened the march  then came blaise and denis  the twins  the  parents bringing up the rear  everything at first went remarkably well   they strolled on slowly in the gay sunshine  that beautiful winter  afternoon was exquisitely pure and clear  and though it was very cold  in the shade  all seemed golden and velvety in the stretches of bright  light  there were a great many people out of doors  all the idle folks   clad in their sunday best  whom the faintest sunshine draws in crowds to  the promenades of paris  little rose  feeling warm and gay  drew herself  up as if to show the people that she was a big girl  she crossed the  whole extent of the champ de mars without asking to be carried  and her  three brothers strode along making the frozen pavement resound beneath  their steps  promenaders were ever turning round to watch them  in other  cities of europe the sight of a young married couple preceded by four  children would have excited no comment  but here in paris the spectacle  was so unusual that remarks of astonishment  sarcasm  and even  compassion were exchanged  mathieu and marianne divined  even if they  did not actually hear  these comments  but they cared nothing for  them  they bravely went their way  smiling at one another  and feeling  convinced that the course they had taken in life was the right one   whatever other folks might think or say     it was three o clock when they turned their steps homeward  and  marianne  feeling rather tired  then took a little rest on a sofa in  the drawing room  where zoe had previously lighted a good fire  the  children  quieted by fatigue  were sitting round a little table   listening to a tale which denis read from a story book  when a visitor  was announced  this proved to be constance  who  after driving out with  maurice  had thought of calling to inquire after marianne  whom she  saw only once or twice a week  although the little pavilion was merely  separated by a garden from the large house on the quay      oh  are you poorly  my dear   she inquired as she entered the room and  perceived marianne on the sofa      oh  dear  no   replied the other   but i have been out walking for the  last two hours and am now taking some rest      mathieu had brought an armchair forward for his wife s rich  vain  cousin  who  whatever her real feelings  certainly strove to appear  amiable  she apologized for not being able to call more frequently  and  explained what a number of duties she had to discharge as mistress  of her home  meantime maurice  clad in black velvet  hung round her  petticoats  gazing from a distance at the other children  who one and  all returned his scrutiny      well  maurice   exclaimed his mother   don t you wish your little  cousins good day      he had to do as he was bidden and step towards them  but all five  remained embarrassed  they seldom met  and had as yet had no opportunity  to quarrel  the four little savages of chantebled felt indeed almost out  of their element in the presence of this young parisian with bourgeois  manners      and are all your little folks quite well   resumed constance  who  with  her sharp eyes  was comparing her son with the other lads   ambroise has  grown  his elder brothers also look very strong      her examination did not apparently result to maurice s advantage  the  latter was tall and looked sturdy  but he had quite a waxen complexion   nevertheless  the glance that constance gave the others was full of  irony  disdain  and condemnation  when she had first heard that marianne  was likely to become a mother once more she had made no secret of her  disapproval  she held to her old opinions more vigorously than ever     marianne  knowing full well that they would fall out if they discussed  the subject of children  sought another topic of conversation  she  inquired after beauchene   and alexandre   said she   why did you not  bring him with you  i haven t seen him for a week       why   broke in mathieu   i told you he had gone shooting yesterday  evening  he slept  no doubt  at puymoreau  the other side of chantebled   so as to be in the woods at daybreak this morning  and he probably won t  be home till to morrow       ah  yes  i remember now  well  it s nice weather to be in the woods      this  however  was another perilous subject  and marianne regretted  having broached it  for  truth to tell  one never knew where beauchene  might really be when he claimed to have gone shooting  he availed  himself so often of this pretext to absent himself from home that  constance was doubtless aware of the truth  but in the presence of that  household  whose union was so perfect  she was determined to show a  brave front      well  you know   said she   it is i who compel him to go about and take  as much exercise as possible  he has a temperament that needs the open  air  shooting is very good for him      at this same moment there came another ring at the door  announcing  another visitor  and this time it was madame morange who entered the  room  with her daughter reine  she colored when she caught sight of  madame beauchene  so keenly was she impressed by that perfect model  of wealth and distinction  whom she ever strove to imitate  constance   however  profited by the diversion of valerie s arrival to declare that  she unfortunately could not remain any longer  as a friend must now be  waiting for her at home      well  at all events  leave us maurice   suggested mathieu   here s  reine here now  and all six children can play a little while together  i  will bring you the boy by and by  when he has had a little snack      but maurice had already once more sought refuge among his mother s  skirts  and she refused the invitation   oh  no  no   said she   he has  to keep to a certain diet  you know  and he must not eat anything away  from home  good by  i must be off  i called only to inquire after you  all in passing  keep well  good by      then she led her boy away  never speaking to valerie  but simply shaking  hands with her in a familiar  protecting fashion  which the other  considered to be extremely distinguished  reine  on her side  had smiled  at maurice  whom she already slightly knew  she looked delightful that  day in her gown of thick blue cloth  her face smiling under her heavy  black tresses  and showing such a likeness to her mother that she seemed  to be the latter s younger sister     marianne  quite charmed  called the girl to her   come and kiss me  my  dear  oh  what a pretty young lady  why  she is getting quite beautiful  and tall  how old is she       nearly thirteen   valerie replied     she had seated herself in the armchair vacated by constance  and mathieu  noticed what a keen expression of anxiety there was in her soft eyes   after mentioning that she also had called in passing to make inquiries   and declaring that both mother and children looked remarkably well   she relapsed into gloomy silence  scarcely listening to marianne  who  thanked her for having come  thereupon it occurred to mathieu to leave  her with his wife  to him it seemed that she must have something on her  mind  and perhaps she wished to make a confidante of marianne      my dear reine   said he   come with these little ones into the  dining room  we will see what afternoon snack there is  and lay the  cloth      this proposal was greeted with shouts of delight  and all the children  trooped into the dining room with mathieu  a quarter of an hour later   when everything was ready there  and valerie came in  the latter s eyes  looked very red  as if she had been weeping  and that evening  when  mathieu was alone with his wife  he learnt what the trouble was   morange s scheme of leaving the beauchene works and entering the service  of the credit national  where he would speedily rise to a high and  lucrative position  his hope too of giving reine a big dowry and  marrying her off to advantage  all the ambitious dreams of rank and  wealth in which his wife and he had indulged  now showed no likelihood  of fulfilment  since it seemed probable that valerie might again have  a child  both she and her husband were in despair over it  and though  marianne had done her utmost to pacify her friend and reconcile her  to circumstances  there were reasons to fear that in her distracted  condition she might do something desperate     four days later  when the froments lunched with the seguins du hordel  at the luxurious mansion in the avenue d antin  they came upon similar  trouble there  seguin  who was positively enraged  did not scruple to  accuse his wife of infidelity  and  on his side  he took to quite a  bachelor life  he had been a gambler in his younger days  and had never  fully cured himself of that passion  which now broke out afresh  like a  fire which has only slumbered for a time  he spent night after night at  his club  playing at baccarat  and could be met in the betting ring  at every race meeting  then  too  he glided into equivocal society and  appeared at home only at intervals to vent his irritation and spite and  jealousy upon his ailing wife     she  poor woman  was absolutely guiltless of the charges preferred  against her  but knowing her husband  and unwilling for her own part to  give up her life of pleasure  she had practised concealment as long  as possible  and now she was really very ill  haunted too by an  unreasoning  irremovable fear that it would all end in her death   mathieu  who had seen her but a few months previously looking so  fair and fresh  was amazed to find her such a wreck  and on her side  valentine gazed  all astonishment  at marianne  noticing with surprise  how calm and strong the young woman seemed  and how limpid her clear and  smiling eyes remained     on the day of the froments  visit seguin had gone out early in the  morning  and when they arrived he had not yet returned  thus the lunch  was for a short time kept waiting  and during the interval celeste  the  maid  entered the room where the visitors sat near her mistress  who was  stretched upon a sofa  looking a perfect picture of distress  valentine  turned a questioning glance on the servant  who forthwith replied      no  madame  monsieur has not come back yet  but that woman of my  village is here  you know  madame  the woman i spoke to you about   sophie couteau  la couteau as we call her at rougemont  who brings  nurses to paris       well  what of it   exclaimed valentine  on the point of ordering  celeste to leave the room  for it seemed to her quite outrageous to be  disturbed in this manner      well  madame  she s here  and as i told you before  if you would  intrust her with the matter now she would find a very good wet nurse for  you in the country  and bring her here whenever she s wanted      la couteau had been standing behind the door  which had remained  ajar  and scarcely had celeste finished than  without waiting for an  invitation  she boldly entered the room  she was a quick little wizened  woman  with certain peasant ways  but considerably polished by her  frequent journeys to paris  so far as her small keen eyes and pointed  nose went her long face was not unpleasant  but its expression of  good nature was marred by her hard mouth  her thin lips  suggestive of  artfulness and cupidity  her gown of dark woollen stuff  her black  cape  black mittens  and black cap with yellow ribbons  gave her the  appearance of a respectable countrywoman going to mass in her sunday  best      have you been a nurse   valentine inquired  as she scrutinized her      yes  madame   replied la couteau   but that was ten years ago  when i  was only twenty  it seemed to me that i wasn t likely to make much money  by remaining a nurse  and so i preferred to set up as an agent to bring  others to paris      as she spoke she smiled  like an intelligent woman who feels that those  who give their services as wet nurses to bourgeois families are simply  fools and dupes  however  she feared that she might have said too much  on the point  and so she added   but one does what one can  eh  madame   the doctor told me that i should never do for a nurse again  and so  i thought that i might perhaps help the poor little dears in another  manner       and you bring wet nurses to the paris offices       yes  madame  twice a month  i supply several offices  but more  particularly madame broquette s office in the rue roquepine  it s a very  respectable place  where one runs no risk of being deceived  and so  if  you like  madame  i will choose the very best i can find for you  the  pick of the bunch  so to say  i know the business thoroughly  and you  can rely on me      as her mistress did not immediately reply  celeste ventured to  intervene  and began by explaining how it happened that la couteau had  called that day      when she goes back into the country  madame  she almost always takes  a baby with her  sometimes a nurse s child  and sometimes the child of  people who are not well enough off to keep a nurse in the house  and she  takes these children to some of the rearers in the country  she just now  came to see me before going round to my friend madame menoux  whose baby  she is to take away with her      valentine became interested  this madame menoux was a haberdasher in the  neighborhood and a great friend of celeste s  she had married a former  soldier  a tall handsome fellow  who now earned a hundred and fifty  francs a month as an attendant at a museum  she was very fond of him   and had bravely set up a little shop  the profits from which doubled  their income  in such wise that they lived very happily and almost at  their ease  celeste  who frequently absented herself from her duties to  spend hours gossiping in madame menoux s little shop  was forever being  scolded for this practice  but in the present instance valentine  full  of anxiety and curiosity  did not chide her  the maid was quite proud  at being questioned  and informed her mistress that madame menoux s  baby was a fine little boy  and that the mother had been attended by a  certain madame rouche  who lived at the lower end of the rue du rocher      it was i who recommended her   continued the servant   for a friend of  mine whom she had attended had spoken to me very highly of her  no doubt  she has not such a good position as madame bourdieu  who has so handsome  a place in the rue de miromesnil  but she is less expensive  and so very  kind and obliging      then celeste suddenly ceased speaking  for she noticed that mathieu s  eyes were fixed upon her  and this  for reasons best known to herself   made her feel uncomfortable  he on his side certainly placed no  confidence in this big dark girl with a head like that of a horse  who   it seemed to him  knew far too much     marianne joined in the conversation   but why   asked she   why does not  this madame menoux  whom you speak about  keep her baby with her      thereupon la couteau turned a dark harsh glance upon this lady visitor   who  whatever course she might take herself  had certainly no right to  prevent others from doing business      oh  it s impossible   exclaimed celeste  well pleased with  the diversion   madame menoux s shop is no bigger than my  pocket handkerchief  and at the back of it there is only one little room  where she and her husband take their meals and sleep  and that room   too  overlooks a tiny courtyard where one can neither see nor breathe   the baby would not live a week in such a place  and  besides  madame  menoux would not have time to attend to the child  she has never had a  servant  and what with waiting on customers and having to cook meals in  time for her husband s return from the museum  she never has a moment  to spare  oh  if she could  she would be very happy to keep the little  fellow with her       it is true   said marianne sadly   there are some poor mothers whom i  pity with all my heart  this person you speak of is not in poverty  and  yet is reduced to this cruel separation  for my part  i should not be  able to exist if a child of mine were taken away from me to some unknown  spot and given to another woman      la couteau doubtless interpreted this as an attack upon herself   assuming the kindly demeanor of one who dotes on children  the air which  she always put on to prevail over hesitating mothers  she replied    oh  rougemont is such a very pretty place  and then it s not far from  bayeux  so that folks are by no means savages there  the air is so pure   too  that people come there to recruit their health  and  besides  the  little ones who are confided to us are well cared for  i assure you   one would have to be heartless to do otherwise than love such little  angels      however  like celeste  she relapsed into silence on seeing how  significantly mathieu was looking at her  perhaps  in spite of her  rustic ways  she understood that there was a false ring in her voice   besides  of what use was her usual patter about the salubrity of the  region  since that lady  madame seguin  wished to have a nurse at her  house  so she resumed   then it s understood  madame  i will bring you  the best we have  a real treasure      valentine  now a little tranquillized as to her fears for herself  found  strength to speak out   no  no  i won t pledge myself in advance  i  will send to see the nurses you bring to the office  and we shall see if  there is one to suit me      then  without occupying herself further about the woman  she turned to  marianne  and asked   shall you nurse your baby yourself       certainly  as i did with the others  we have very decided opinions on  that point  my husband and i       no doubt  i understand you  i should much like to do the same myself   but it is impossible      la couteau had remained there motionless  vexed at having come on a  fruitless errand  and regretting the loss of the present which she would  have earned by her obligingness in providing a nurse  she put all her  spite into a glance which she shot at marianne  who  thought she  was  evidently some poor creature unable even to afford a nurse  however  at  a sign which celeste made her  she courtesied humbly and withdrew in the  company of the maid     a few minutes afterwards  seguin arrived  and  repairing to the  dining room  they all sat down to lunch there  it was a very luxurious  meal  comprising eggs  red mullet  game  and crawfish  with red and  white bordeaux wines and iced champagne  such diet for valentine and  marianne would never have met with dr  boutan s approval  but seguin  declared the doctor to be an unbearable individual whom nobody could  ever please     he  seguin  while showing all politeness to his guests  seemed that day  to be in an execrable temper  again and again he levelled annoying and  even galling remarks at his wife  carrying things to such a point at  times that tears came to the unfortunate woman s eyes  now that he  scarcely set foot in the house he complained that everything was going  wrong there  if he spent his time elsewhere it was  according to him   entirely his wife s fault  the place was becoming a perfect hell upon  earth  and in everything  the slightest incident  the most common place  remark  he found an opportunity for jeers and gibes  these made mathieu  and marianne extremely uncomfortable  but at last he let fall such a  harsh expression that valentine indignantly rebelled  and he had to  apologize  at heart he feared her  especially when the blood of the  vaugelades arose within her  and she gave him to understand  in her  haughty disdainful way  that she would some day revenge herself on him  for his treatment     however  seeking another outlet for his spite and rancor  he at last  turned to mathieu  and spoke of chantebled  saying bitterly that the  game in the covers there was fast becoming scarcer and scarcer  in such  wise that he now had difficulty in selling his shooting shares  so that  his income from the property was dwindling every year  he made no secret  of the fact that he would much like to sell the estate  but where could  he possibly find a purchaser for those unproductive woods  those sterile  plains  those marshes and those tracts of gravel     mathieu listened to all this attentively  for during his long walks  in the summer he had begun to take an interest in the estate   are you  really of opinion that it cannot be cultivated   he asked   it s pitiful  to see all that land lying waste and idle       cultivate it   cried seguin   ah  i should like to see such a miracle   the only crops that one will ever raise on it are stones and frogs      they had by this time eaten their dessert  and before rising from table  marianne was telling valentine that she would much like to see and kiss  her children  who had not been allowed to lunch with their elders on  account of their supposed unruly ways  when a couple of visitors  arrived in turn  and everything else was forgotten  one was santerre the  novelist  who of late had seldom called on the seguins  and the other   much to mathieu s dislike  proved to be beauchene s sister  seraphine   the baroness de lowicz  she looked at the young man in a bold   provoking  significant manner  and then  like santerre  cast a sly  glance of mocking contempt at marianne and valentine  she and the  novelist between them soon turned the conversation on to subjects that  appealed to their vicious tastes  and santerre related that he had  lately seen doctor gaude perform several operations at the marbeuf  hospital  he had found there the usual set of society men who attend  first performances at the theatres  and indeed there were also some  women present     and then he enlarged upon the subject  giving the crudest and most  precise particulars  much to the delight of seguin  who every now and  again interpolated remarks of approval  while both mathieu and marianne  grew more and more ill at ease  the young woman sat looking with  amazement at santerre as he calmly recapitulated horror after horror  to  the evident enjoyment of the others  she remembered having read his last  book  that love story which had seemed to her so supremely absurd  with  its theories of the annihilation of the human species  and she at  last glanced at mathieu to tell him how weary she felt of all the  semi society and semi medical chatter around her  and how much she would  like to go off home  leaning on his arm  and walking slowly along the  sunlit quays  he  for his part  felt a pang at seeing so much insanity  rife amid those wealthy surroundings  he made his wife a sign that it  was indeed time to take leave      what  are you going already   valentine then exclaimed   well  i dare  not detain you if you feel tired   however  when marianne begged her to  kiss the children for her  she added   why  yes  it s true you have not  seen them  wait a moment  pray  i want you to kiss them yourself      but when celeste appeared in answer to the bell  she announced  that monsieur gaston and mademoiselle lucie had gone out with their  governess  and this made seguin explode once more  all his rancor  against his wife revived  the house was going to rack and ruin  she  spent her days lying on a sofa  since when had the governess taken leave  to go out with the children without saying anything  one could not  even see the children now in order to kiss them  it was a nice state of  things  they were left to the servants  in fact  it was the servants now  who controlled the house     thereupon valentine began to cry       mon dieu    said marianne to her husband  when she found herself out  of doors  able to breathe  and happy once more now that she was leaning  on his arm   why  they are quite mad  the people in that house       yes   mathieu responded   they are mad  no doubt  but we must pity  them  for they know not what happiness is            vi    about nine o clock one fine cold morning  a few days afterwards  as  mathieu  bound for his office  a little late through having lingered  near his wife  was striding hastily across the garden which separated  the pavilion from the factory yard  he met constance and maurice  who   clad in furs  were going out for a walk in the sharp air  beauchene  who  was accompanying them as far as the gate  bareheaded and ever sturdy and  victorious  gayly exclaimed to his wife      give the youngster a good spin on his legs  let him take in all the  fresh air he can  there s nothing like that and good food to make a  man      mathieu  on hearing this  stopped short   has maurice been poorly  again   he inquired      oh  no   hastily replied the boy s mother  with an appearance of great  gayety  assumed perhaps from an unconscious desire to hide certain  covert fears   only the doctor wants him to take exercise  and it is so  fine this morning that we are going off on quite an expedition       don t go along the quays   said beauchene again   go up towards the  invalides  he ll have much stiffer marching to do when he s a soldier      then  the mother and the child having taken themselves off  he went  back into the works with mathieu  adding in his triumphant way   that  youngster  you know  is as strong as an oak  but women are always so  nervous  for my part  i m quite easy in mind about him  as you can see    and with a laugh he concluded   when one has but one son  he keeps him      that same day  about an hour later  a terrible dispute which broke  out between old moineaud s daughters  norine and euphrasie  threw the  factory into a state of commotion  norine s intrigue with beauchene  had ended in the usual way  he had soon tired of the girl and betaken  himself to some other passing fancy  leaving her to her tears  her  shame  and all the consequences of her fault  for although it had  hitherto been possible for her to conceal her condition from her  parents  she was unable to deceive her sister  who was her constant  companion  the two girls were always bickering  and norine had for some  time lived in dread of scandal and exposure  and that day the trouble  came to a climax  beginning with a trivial dispute about a bit of  glass paper in the workroom  then developing into a furious exchange of  coarse  insulting language  and culminating in a frantic outburst from  euphrasie  who shrieked to the assembled work girls all that she knew  about her sister     there was an outrageous scene  the sisters fought  clawing and  scratching one another desperately  and could not be separated until  beauchene  mathieu  and morange  attracted by the extraordinary uproar   rushed into the workroom and restored a little order  fortunately for  beauchene  euphrasie did not know the whole truth  and norine  after  giving her employer a humble  supplicating glance  kept silence  but old  moineaud was present  and the public revelation of his daughter s shame  sent him into a fury  he ordered norine out of the works forthwith  and  threatened to throw her out of window should he find her at home when  he returned there in the evening  and beauchene  both annoyed at the  scandal and ashamed at being the primary cause of it  did not venture to  interfere  it was only after the unhappy norine had rushed off sobbing  that he found strength of mind to attempt to pacify the father  and  assert his authority in the workroom by threatening to dismiss one and  all of the girls if the slightest scandal  the slightest noise  should  ever occur there again     mathieu was deeply pained by the scene  but kept his own counsel  what  most astonished him was the promptness with which beauchene regained his  self possession as soon as norine had fled  and the majesty with which  he withdrew to his office after threatening the others and restoring  order  another whom the scene had painfully affected was morange  whom  mathieu  to his surprise  found ghastly pale  with trembling hands   as if indeed he had had some share of responsibility in this unhappy  business  but morange  as he confided to mathieu  was distressed for  other reasons  the scene in the workroom  the revelation of norine s  condition  the fate awaiting the girl driven away into the bleak   icy streets  had revived all his own poignant worries with respect to  valerie  mathieu had already heard of the latter s trouble from his  wife  and he speedily grasped the accountant s meaning  it vaguely  seemed to him also that morange was yielding to the same unreasoning  despair as valerie  and was almost willing that she should take the  desperate course which she had hinted to marianne  but it was a very  serious matter  and mathieu did not wish to be in any way mixed up in  it  having tried his best to pacify the cashier  he sought forgetfulness  of these painful incidents in his work     that afternoon  however  a little girl  cecile moineaud  the old  fitter s youngest daughter  slipped into his office  with a message from  her mother  beseeching him to speak with her  he readily understood  that the woman wished to see him respecting norine  and in his usual  compassionate way he consented to go  the interview took place in one  of the adjacent streets  down which the cold winter wind was blowing  la  moineaude was there with norine and another little girl of hers  irma   a child eight years of age  both norine and her mother wept abundantly  while begging mathieu to help them  he alone knew the whole truth  and  was in a position to approach beauchene on the subject  la moineaude was  firmly determined to say nothing to her husband  she trembled for his  future and that of her son alfred  who was now employed at the works   for there was no telling what might happen if beauchene s name should be  mentioned  life was indeed hard enough already  and what would become  of them all should the family bread winners be turned away from the  factory  norine certainly had no legal claim on beauchene  the law being  peremptory on that point  but  now that she had lost her employment  and  was driven from home by her father  could he leave her to die of want in  the streets  the girl tried to enforce her moral claim by asserting that  she had always been virtuous before meeting beauchene  in any case  her  lot remained a very hard one  that beauchene was the father of her child  there could be no doubt  and at last mathieu  without promising success   told the mother that he would do all he could in the matter     he kept his word that same afternoon  and after a great deal of  difficulty he succeeded  at first beauchene fumed  stormed  denied   equivocated  almost blamed mathieu for interfering  talked too of  blackmail  and put on all sorts of high and mighty airs  but at heart  the matter greatly worried him  what if norine or her mother should  go to his wife  constance might close her eyes as long as she simply  suspected things  but if complaints were formally  openly made to her   there would be a terrible scandal  on the other hand  however  should  he do anything for the girl  it would become known  and everybody would  regard him as responsible  and then there would be no end to what he  called the blackmailing     however  when beauchene reached this stage mathieu felt that the battle  was gained  he smiled and answered   of course  one can never tell  the  girl is certainly not malicious  but when women are driven beyond  endurance  they become capable of the worst follies  i must say that  she made no demands of me  she did not even explain what she wanted   she simply said that she could not remain in the streets in this bleak  weather  since her father had turned her away from home  if you want my  opinion  it is this  i think that one might at once put her to board at  a proper place  let us say that four or five months will elapse before  she is able to work again  that would mean a round sum of five hundred  francs in expenses  at that cost she might be properly looked after      beauchene walked nervously up and down  and then replied   well  i  haven t a bad heart  as you know  five hundred francs more or less will  not inconvenience me  if i flew into a temper just now it was because  the mere idea of being robbed and imposed upon puts me beside myself   but if it s a question of charity  why  then  do as you suggest  it must  be understood  however  that i won t mix myself up in anything  i wish  even to remain ignorant of what you do  choose a nurse  place the girl  where you please  and i will simply pay the bill  neither more nor  less      then he heaved a sigh of relief at the prospect of being extricated from  this equivocal position  the worry of which he refused to acknowledge   and once more he put on the mien of a superior  victorious man  one who  is certain that he will win all the battles of life  in fact  he even  jested about the girl  and at last went off repeating his instructions    see that my conditions are fully understood  i don t want to know  anything about any child  do whatever you please  but never let me hear  another word of the matter      that day was certainly one fertile in incidents  for in the evening  there was quite an alarm at the beauchenes  at the moment when they were  about to sit down to dinner little maurice fainted away and fell upon  the floor  nearly a quarter of an hour elapsed before the child could  be revived  and meantime the distracted parents quarrelled and shouted   accusing one another of having compelled the lad to go out walking that  morning in such cold  frosty weather  it was evidently that foolish  outing which had chilled him  at least  this was what they said to one  another by way of quieting their anxiety  constance  while she held her  boy in her arms  pictured him as dead  it occurred to her for the first  time that she might possibly lose him  at this idea she experienced a  terrible heart pang  and a feeling of motherliness came upon her  so  acute that it was like a revelation  the ambitious woman that was in  her  she who dreamt of royalty for that only son  the future princely  owner of the ever growing family fortune  likewise suffered horribly  if  she was to lose that son she would have no child left  why had she none  other  was it not she who had willed it thus  at this thought a feeling  of desperate regret shot through her like a red hot blade  burning  her cruelly to the very depths of her being  maurice  however  at last  recovered consciousness  and even sat down to the table and ate with a  fair appetite  then beauchene immediately shrugged his shoulders  and  began to jest about the unreasoning fears of women  and as time went by  constance herself ceased to think of the incident     on the morrow  when mathieu had to attend to the delicate mission which  he had undertaken  he remembered the two women of whom celeste  the  maid  had spoken on the day of his visit to the seguins  he at first  dismissed all idea of that madame rouche  of whom the girl had spoken  so strangely  but he thought of making some inquiries respecting madame  bourdieu  who accommodated boarders at the little house where she  resided in the rue de miromesnil  and he seemed to remember that this  woman had attended madame morange at the time of reine s birth  a  circumstance which induced him to question the cashier     at the very first words the latter seemed greatly disturbed   yes  a  lady friend recommended madame bourdieu to my wife   said he   but why  do you ask me      and as he spoke he looked at mathieu with an expression of anguish   as if that sudden mention of madame bourdieu s name signified that the  young fellow had guessed his secret preoccupations  it was as though he  had been abruptly surprised in wrong doing  perhaps  too  certain dim   haunting thoughts  which he had long been painfully revolving in his  mind  without as yet being able to come to a decision  took shape at  that moment  at all events  he turned pale and his lips trembled     then  as mathieu gave him to understand that it was a question of  placing norine somewhere  he involuntarily let an avowal escape him      my wife was speaking to me of madame bourdieu only this morning   he  began   oh  i don t know how it happened  but  as you are aware   reine was born so many years ago that i can t give you any precise  information  it seems that the woman has done well  and is now at the  head of a first class establishment  inquire there yourself  i have no  doubt you will find what you want there      mathieu followed this advice  but at the same time  as he had been  warned that madame bourdieu s terms were rather high  he stifled his  prejudices and began by repairing to the rue du rocher in order to  reconnoitre madame rouche s establishment and make some inquiries of  her  the mere aspect of the place chilled him  it was one of the black  houses of old paris  with a dark  evil smelling passage  leading into  a small yard which the nurse s few squalid rooms overlooked  above the  passage entrance was a yellow signboard which simply bore the name of  madame rouche in big letters  she herself proved to be a person of five   or six and thirty  gowned in black and spare of figure  with a leaden  complexion  scanty hair of no precise color  and a big nose of unusual  prominence  with her low  drawling speech  her prudent  cat like  gestures  and her sour smile  he divined her to be a dangerous   unscrupulous woman  she told him that  as the accommodation at her  disposal was so small  she only took boarders for a limited time  and  this of course enabled him to curtail his inquiries  glad to have done  with her  he hurried off  oppressed by nausea and vaguely frightened by  what he had seen of the place     on the other hand  madame bourdieu s establishment  a little  three storied house in the rue de miromesnil  between the rue la boetie  and the rue de penthievre  offered an engaging aspect  with its  bright facade and muslin curtained windows  and madame bourdieu  then  two and thirty  rather short and stout  had a broad  pleasant white  face  which had greatly helped her on the road to success  she  expatiated to mathieu on the preliminary training that was required  by one of her profession  the cost of it  the efforts needed to make  a position  the responsibilities  the inspections  the worries of all  sorts that she had to face  and she plainly told the young man that her  charge for a boarder would be two hundred francs a month  this was  far more than he was empowered to give  however  after some further  conversation  when madame bourdieu learnt that it was a question of four  months  board  she became more accommodating  and agreed to accept a  round sum of six hundred francs for the entire period  provided that  the person for whom mathieu was acting would consent to occupy a  three bedded room with two other boarders     altogether there were about a dozen boarders  rooms in the house  some  of these having three  and even four  beds  while others  the terms for  which were naturally higher  contained but one  madame bourdieu could  accommodate as many as thirty boarders  and as a rule  she had some  five and twenty staying on her premises  provided they complied with the  regulations  no questions were asked them  they were not required to say  who they were or whence they came  and in most cases they were merely  known by some christian name which they chose to give     mathieu ended by agreeing to madame bourdieu s terms  and that same  evening norine was taken to her establishment  some little trouble  ensued with beauchene  who protested when he learnt that five hundred  francs would not suffice to defray the expenses  however  mathieu  managed affairs so diplomatically that at last the other not only became  reconciled to the terms  but provided the money to purchase a little  linen  and even agreed to supply pocket money to the extent of ten  francs a month  thus  five days after norine had entered madame  bourdieu s establishment  mathieu decided to return thither to hand the  girl her first ten francs and tell her that he had settled everything     he found her there in the boarders  refectory with some of her  companions in the house  a tall  thin  severe looking englishwoman  with  lifeless eyes and bloodless lips  who called herself amy  and a pale  red haired girl with a tip tilted nose and a big mouth  who was known as  victoire  then  too  there was a young person of great beauty answering  to the name of rosine  a jeweller s daughter  so norine told mathieu   whose story was at once pathetic and horrible  the young man  while  waiting to see madame bourdieu  who was engaged  sat for a time  answering norine s questions  and listening to the others  who conversed  before him in a free and open way  his heart was wrung by much that he  heard  and as soon as he could rid himself of norine he returned to the  waiting room  eager to complete his business  there  however  two women  who wished to consult madame bourdieu  and who sat chatting side by side  on a sofa  told him that she was still engaged  so that he was compelled  to tarry a little longer  he ensconced himself in a large armchair  and  taking a newspaper from his pocket  began to read it  but he had not  been thus occupied for many minutes before the door opened and a servant  entered  ushering in a lady dressed in black and thickly veiled  whom  she asked to be good enough to wait her turn  mathieu was on the point  of rising  for  though his back was turned to the door  he could see   in a looking glass  that the new arrival was none other than morange s  wife  valerie  after a moment s hesitation  however  the sight of her  black gown and thick veil  which seemed to indicate that she desired to  escape recognition  induced him to dive back into his armchair and feign  extreme attention to his newspaper  she  on her side  had certainly  not noticed him  but by glancing slantwise towards the looking glass he  could observe all her movements     meantime the conversation between the other women on the sofa continued   and to mathieu s surprise it suddenly turned on madame rouche   concerning whom one of them began telling the most horrible stories   which fully confirmed the young man s previous suspicions  these stories  seemed to have a powerful fascination for valerie  who sat in a corner   never stirring  but listening intently  she did not even turn her head  towards the other women  but  beneath her veil  mathieu could detect her  big eyes glittering feverishly  she started but once  it was when one of  the others inquired of her friend where that horrid creature la rouche  resided  and the other replied   at the lower end of the rue du rocher      then their chatter abruptly ceased  for madame bourdieu made her  appearance on the threshold of her private room  the gossips exchanged  only a few words with her  and then  as mathieu remained in his  armchair  the high back of which concealed him from view  valerie rose  from her seat and followed madame bourdieu into the private room     as soon as he was alone the young man let his newspaper fall upon his  knees  and lapsed into a reverie  haunted by all the chatter he had  heard  both there and in norine s company  and shuddering at the thought  of the dreadful secrets that had been revealed to him  how long an  interval elapsed he could not tell  but at last he was suddenly roused  by a sound of voices     madame bourdieu was now escorting valerie to the door  she had the same  plump fresh face as usual  and even smiled in a motherly way  but the  other was quivering  as with distress and grief   you are not sensible   my dear child   said madame bourdieu to her   it is simply foolish of  you  come  go home and be good      then  valerie having withdrawn without uttering a word  madame bourdieu  was greatly surprised to see mathieu  who had risen from his chair  and  she suddenly became serious  displeased with herself at having spoken  in his presence  fortunately  a diversion was created by the arrival  of norine  who came in from the refectory  and mathieu then promptly  settled his business and went off  after promising norine that he would  return some day to see her     to make up for lost time he was walking hastily towards the rue la  boetie  when  all at once  he came to a halt  for at the very corner of  that street he again perceived valerie  now talking to a man  none other  than her husband  so morange had come with her  and had waited for her  in the street while she interviewed madame bourdieu  and now they both  stood there consulting together  hesitating and evidently in distress   it was plain to mathieu that a terrible combat was going on within them   they stamped about  moved hither and thither in a feverish way  then  halted once more to resume their conversation in a whisper  at one  moment the young man felt intensely relieved  for  turning into the rue  la boetie  they walked on slowly  as if downcast and resigned  in  the direction of grenelle  but all at once they halted once more and  exchanged a few words  and then mathieu s heart contracted as he saw  them retrace their steps along the rue la boetie and follow the rue de  la pepiniere as far as the rue du rocher  he readily divined whither  they were going  but some irresistible force impelled him to follow  them  and before long  from an open doorway  in which he prudently  concealed himself  he saw them look round to ascertain whether they were  observed  and then slink  first the wife and afterwards the husband   into the dark passage of la rouche s house  for a moment mathieu  lingered in his hiding place  quivering  full of dread and horror  and  when at last he turned his steps homeward it was with a heavy heart  indeed     the weeks went by  the winter ran its course  and march had come round   when the memory of all that the young fellow had heard and seen that  day  things which he had vainly striven to forget  was revived in the  most startling fashion  one morning at eight o clock morange abruptly  called at the little pavilion in the rue de la federation  accompanied  by his daughter reine  the cashier was livid  haggard  distracted  and  as soon as reine had joined mathieu s children  and could not hear what  he said  he implored the young man to come with him  in a gasp he told  the dreadful truth  valerie was dying  her daughter believed her to  be in the country  but that was a mere fib devised to quiet the girl   valerie was elsewhere  in paris  and he  morange  had a cab waiting  below  but lacked the strength to go back to her alone  so poignant was  his grief  so great his dread     mathieu was expecting a happy event that very day  and he at first told  the cashier that he could not possibly go with him  but when he had  informed marianne that he believed that something dreadful had happened  to the moranges  she bravely bade him render all assistance  and then  the two men drove  as mathieu had anticipated  to the rue du rocher  and  there found the hapless valerie  not dying  but dead  and white  and icy  cold  ah  the desperate  tearless grief of the husband  who fell upon  his knees at the bedside  benumbed  annihilated  as if he also felt  death s heavy hand upon him     for a moment  indeed  the young man anticipated exposure and scandal   but when he hinted this to la rouche she faintly smiled  she had friends  on many sides  it seemed  she had already reported valerie s death at  the municipal office  and the doctor  who would be sent to certify the  demise  would simply ascribe it to natural causes  such was the usual  practice     then mathieu bethought himself of leading morange away  but the other   still plunged in painful stupor  did not heed him      no  no  my friend  i pray you  say nothing   he at last replied  in a  very faint  distant voice  as though he feared to awaken the unfortunate  woman who had fallen asleep forever   i know what i have done  i shall  never forgive myself  if she lies there  it is because i consented  yet  i adored her  and never wished her aught but happiness  i loved her too  much  and i was weak  still  i was the husband  and when her madness  came upon her i ought to have acted sensibly  and have warned and  dissuaded her  i can understand and excuse her  poor creature  but as  for me  it is all over  i am a wretch  i feel horrified with myself      all his mediocrity and tenderness of heart sobbed forth in this  confession of his weakness  and his voice never gave sign of animation   never rose in a louder tone from the depths of his annihilated being   which would evermore be void   she wished to be gay  and rich  and  happy   he continued   it was so legitimate a wish on her part  she  was so intelligent and beautiful  there was only one delight for me  to  content her tastes and satisfy her ambition  you know our new flat   we spent far too much money on it  then came that story of the credit  national and the hope of speedily rising to fortune  and thus  when the  trouble came  and i saw her distracted at the idea of having to renounce  all her dreams  i became as mad as she was  and suffered her to do her  will  we thought that our only means of escaping from everlasting penury  and drudgery was to evade nature  and now  alas  she lies there      morange s lugubrious voice  never broken by a sob  never rising to  violence  but sounding like a distant  monotonous  mournful knell  rent  mathieu s heart  he sought words of consolation  and spoke of reine      ah  yes   said the other   i am very fond of reine  she is so like her  mother  you will keep her at your house till to morrow  won t you   tell her nothing  let her play  i will acquaint her with this dreadful  misfortune  and don t worry me  i beg you  don t take me away  i promise  you that i will keep very quiet  i will simply stay here  watching her   nobody will even hear me  i shan t disturb any one      then his voice faltered and he stammered a few more incoherent phrases  as he sank into a dream of his wrecked life     mathieu  seeing him so quiet  so overcome  at last decided to leave him  there  and  entering the waiting cab  drove back to grenelle  ah  it was  indeed relief for him to see the crowded  sunlit streets again  and  to breathe the keen air which came in at both windows of the vehicle   emerging from that horrid gloom  he breathed gladly beneath the vast  sky  all radiant with healthy joy  and the image of marianne arose  before him like a consolatory promise of life s coming victory  an  atonement for every shame and iniquity  his dear wife  whom everlasting  hope kept full of health and courage  and through whom  even amid her  pangs  love would triumph  while they both held themselves in readiness  for to morrow s allotted effort  the cab rolled on so slowly that  mathieu almost despaired  eager as he was to reach his bright little  house  that he might once more take part in life s poem  that august  festival instinct with so much suffering and so much joy  humanity s  everlasting hymn  the coming of a new being into the world     that very day  soon after his return  denis and blaise  ambroise  rose   and reine were sent round to the beauchenes   where they filled the  house with their romping mirth  maurice  however  was again ailing  and  had to lie upon a sofa  disconsolate at being unable to take part in  the play of the others   he has pains in his legs   said his father to  mathieu  when he came round to inquire after marianne   he s growing so  fast  and getting such a big fellow  you know      lightly as beauchene spoke  his eyes even then wavered  and his face  remained for a moment clouded  perhaps  in his turn  he also had felt  the passing of that icy breath from the unknown which one evening had  made constance shudder with dread whilst she clasped her swooning boy in  her arms     but at that moment mathieu  who had left marianne s room to answer  beauchene s inquiries  was summoned back again  and there he now found  the sunlight streaming brilliantly  like a glorious greeting to new  life  while he yet stood there  dazzled by the glow  the doctor said to  him   it is a boy      then mathieu leant over his wife and kissed her lovingly  her beautiful  eyes were still moist with the tears of anguish  but she was already  smiling with happiness      dear  dear wife   said mathieu   how good and brave you are  and how i  love you       yes  yes  i am very happy   she faltered   and i must try to give you  back all the love that you give me      ah  that room of battle and victory  it seemed radiant with triumphant  glory  elsewhere was death  darkness  shame  and crime  but here holy  suffering had led to joy and pride  hope and trustfulness in the coming  future  one single being born  a poor bare wee creature  raising the  faint cry of a chilly fledgeling  and life s immense treasure was  increased and eternity insured  mathieu remembered one warm balmy spring  night when  yonder at chantebled  all the perfumes of fruitful nature  had streamed into their room in the little hunting box  and now around  him amid equal rapture he beheld the ardent sunlight flaring  chanting  the poem of eternal life that sprang from love the eternal           vii     i tell you that i don t need zoe to give the child a bath   exclaimed  mathieu half in anger   stay in bed  and rest yourself       but the servant must get the bath ready   replied marianne   and bring  you some warm water      she laughed as if amused by the dispute  and he ended by laughing also     two days previously they had re installed themselves in the little  pavilion on the verge of the woods near janville which they rented from  the seguins  so impatient  indeed  were they to find themselves once  more among the fields that in spite of the doctor s advice marianne had  made the journey but fifteen days after giving birth to her little boy   however  a precocious springtide brought with it that march such balmy  warmth and sunshine that the only ill effect she experienced was a  little fatigue  and so  on the day after their arrival  sunday  mathieu   glad at being able to remain with her  insisted that she should rest in  bed  and only rise about noon  in time for dejeuner      why   he repeated   i can very well attend to the child while you rest   you have him in your arms from morning till night  and  besides  if you  only knew how pleased i am to be here again with you and the dear little  fellow      he approached her to kiss her gently  and with a fresh laugh she  returned his kiss  it was quite true  they were both delighted to be  back at chantebled  which recalled to them such loving memories  that  room  looking towards the far expanse of sky and all the countryside   renascent  quivering with sap  was gilded with gayety by the early  springtide     marianne leant over the cradle which was near her  beside the bed   the  fact is   said she   master gervais is sound asleep  just look at him   you will never have the heart to wake him      then both father and mother remained for a moment gazing at their  sleeping child  marianne had passed her arm round her husband s neck  and was clinging to him  as they laughed delightedly over the cradle  in which the little one slumbered  he was a fine child  pink and white  already  but only a father and mother could thus contemplate their  offspring  as the baby opened his eyes  which were still full of all the  mystery whence he had come  they raised exclamations full of emotion      you know  he saw me       certainly  and me too  he looked at me  he turned his head       oh  the cherub      it was but an illusion  but that dear little face  still so soft and  silent  told them so many things which none other would have heard  they  found themselves repeated in the child  mingled as it were together   and detected extraordinary likenesses  which for hours and for days  kept them discussing the question as to which of them he most resembled   moreover  each proved very obstinate  declaring that he was the living  portrait of the other     as a matter of course  master gervais had no sooner opened his eyes than  he began to shriek  but marianne was pitiless  her rule was the bath  first and milk afterwards  zoe brought up a big jug of hot water   and then set out the little bath near the window in the sunlight  and  mathieu  all obstinacy  bathed the child  washing him with a soft sponge  for some three minutes  while marianne  from her bed  watched over the  operation  jesting about the delicacy of touch that he displayed  as if  the child were some fragile new born divinity whom he feared to bruise  with his big hands  at the same time they continued marvelling at the  delightful scene  how pretty he looked in the water  his pink skin  shining in the sunlight  and how well behaved he was  for it was  wonderful to see how quickly he ceased wailing and gave signs of  satisfaction when he felt the all enveloping caress of the warm water   never had father and mother possessed such a little treasure      and now   said mathieu  when zoe had helped him to wipe the boy with a  fine cloth   and now we will weigh master gervais      this was a complicated operation  which was rendered the more difficult  by the extreme repugnance that the child displayed  he struggled and  wriggled on the platform of the weighing scales to such a degree that  it was impossible to arrive at his correct weight  in order to ascertain  how much this had increased since the previous occasion  as a rule  the  increase varied from six to seven ounces a week  the father generally  lost patience over the operation  and the mother had to intervene      here  put the scales on the table near my bed  and give me the little  one in his napkin  we will see what the napkin weighs afterwards      at this moment  however  the customary morning invasion took place  the  other four children  who were beginning to know how to dress themselves   the elder ones helping the younger  and zoe lending a hand at times   darted in at a gallop  like frolicsome escaped colts  having  thrown themselves on papa s neck and rushed upon mamma s bed to say  good morning  the boys stopped short  full of admiration and interest  at the sight of gervais in the scales  rose  however  still rather  uncertain on her legs  caught hold of the scales in her impatient  efforts to climb upon the bed  and almost toppled everything over   i  want to see  i want to see   she cried in her shrill voice     at this the others likewise wished to meddle  and already stretched  out their little hands  so that it became necessary to turn them out of  doors      now kindly oblige me by going to play outside   said mathieu   take  your hats and remain under the window  so that we may hear you      then  in spite of the complaints and leaps of master gervais  marianne  was at last able to obtain his correct weight  and what delight there  was  for he had gained more than seven ounces during the week  after  losing weight during the first three days  like all new born children   he was now growing and filling out like a strong  healthy human plant   they could already picture him walking  sturdy and handsome  his mother   sitting up in bed  wrapped his swaddling clothes around him with  her deft  nimble hands  jesting the while and answering each of his  plaintive wails      yes  yes  i know  we are very  very hungry  but it is all right  the  soup is on the fire  and will be served to monsieur smoking hot      on awakening that morning she had made a real sunday toilette  her  superb hair was caught up in a huge chignon which disclosed the  whiteness of her neck  and she wore a white flannel lace trimmed  dressing jacket  which allowed but a little of her bare arms to be seen   propped up by two pillows  she laughingly offered her breast to the  child  who was already protruding his lips and groping with his hands   and when he found what he wanted he eagerly began to suck     mathieu  seeing that both mother and babe were steeped in sunshine  then  went to draw one of the curtains  but marianne exclaimed   no  no  leave  us the sun  it doesn t inconvenience us at all  it fills our veins with  springtide      he came back and lingered near the bed  the sun s rays poured over it   and life blazed there in a florescence of health and beauty  there is no  more glorious blossoming  no more sacred symbol of living eternity  than an infant at its mother s breast  it is like a prolongation of  maternity s travail  when the mother continues giving herself to her  babe  offering him the fountain of life that shall make him a man     scarce is he born to the world than she takes him back and clasps him  to her bosom  that he may there again have warmth and nourishment  and  nothing could be more simple or more necessary  marianne  both for her  own sake and that of her boy  in order that beauty and health might  remain their portion  was naturally his nurse     little gervais was still sucking when zoe  after tidying the room  came  up again with a big bunch of lilac  and announced that monsieur and  madame angelin had called  on their way back from an early walk  to  inquire after madame      show them up   said marianne gayly   i can well receive them      the angelins were the young couple who  having installed themselves in  a little house at janville  ever roamed the lonely paths  absorbed in  their mutual passion  she was delicious  dark  tall  admirably formed   always joyous and fond of pleasure  he  a handsome fellow  fair  and square shouldered  had the gallant mien of a musketeer with his  streaming moustache  in addition to their ten thousand francs a year   which enabled them to live as they liked  he earned a little money  by painting pretty fans  flowery with roses and little women deftly  postured  and so their life had hitherto been a game of love  an  everlasting billing and cooing  towards the close of the previous summer  they had become quite intimate with the froments  through meeting them  well nigh every day      can we come in  are we not intruding   called angelin  in his sonorous  voice  from the landing     then claire  his wife  as soon as she had kissed marianne  apologized  for having called so early      we only learnt last night  my dear   said she   that you had arrived  the day before  we didn t expect you for another eight or ten days  and  so  as we passed the house just now  we couldn t resist calling  you  will forgive us  won t you   then  never waiting for an answer  she  added with the petulant vivacity of a tom tit whom the open air had  intoxicated   oh  so there is the new little gentleman  a boy  am i  not right  and your health is good  but really i need not ask it   mon  dieu   what a pretty little fellow he is  look at him  robert  how  pretty he is  a real little doll  isn t he funny now  isn t he funny  he  is quite amusing      her husband  observing her gayety  drew near and began to admire the  child by way of following her example   ah yes  he is really a pretty  baby  but i have seen so many frightful ones  thin  puny  bluish little  things  looking like little plucked chickens  when they are white and  plump they are quite nice      mathieu began to laugh  and twitted the angelins on having no child  of their own  but on this point they held very decided opinions  they  wished to enjoy life  unburdened by offspring  while they were young  as  for what might happen in five or six years  time  that  of course  was  another matter  nevertheless  madame angelin could not help being struck  by the delightful picture which marianne  so fresh and gay  presented  with her plump little babe at her breast in that white bed amid the  bright sunshine     at last she remarked   there s one thing  i certainly could not feed a  child  i should have to engage a nurse for any baby of mine       of course   her husband replied   i would never allow you to feed it   it would be idiotic      these words had scarcely passed his lips when he regretted them and  apologized to marianne  explaining that no mother possessed of means was  nowadays willing to face the trouble and worry of nursing      oh  for my part   marianne responded  with her quiet smile   if i had a  hundred thousand francs a year i should nurse all my children  even were  there a dozen of them  to begin with  it is so healthful  you know  both  for mother and child  and if i didn t do my duty to the little one  i should look on myself as a criminal  as a mother who grudged her  offspring health and life      lowering her beautiful soft eyes towards her boy  she watched him with a  look of infinite love  while he continued nursing gluttonously  and in a  dreamy voice she continued   to give a child of mine to another  oh no   never  i should feel too jealous  i want my children to be entirely  my own  and it isn t merely a question of a child s physical health  i  speak of his whole being  of the intelligence and heart that will come  to him  and which he ought to derive from me alone  if i should find  him foolish or malicious later on  i should think that his nurse had  poisoned him  dear little fellow  when he pulls like that it is as if he  were drinking me up entirely      then mathieu  deeply moved  turned towards the others  saying   ah  she  is quite right  i only wish that every mother could hear her  and make  it the fashion in france once more to suckle their infants  it would be  sufficient if it became an ideal of beauty  and  indeed  is it not of  the loftiest and brightest beauty      the angelins complaisantly began to laugh  but they did not seem  convinced  just as they rose to take their leave an extraordinary uproar  burst forth beneath the window  the piercing clamor of little wildings   freely romping in the fields  and it was all caused by ambroise throwing  a ball  which had lodged itself on a tree  blaise and denis were  flinging stones at it to bring it down  and rose called and jumped and  stretched out her arms as if she hoped to be able to reach the ball  the  angelins stopped short  surprised and almost nervous      good heavens   murmured claire   what will it be when you have a  dozen       but the house would seem quite dead if they did not romp and shout    said marianne  much amused   good by  my dear  i will go to see you when  i can get about      the months of march and april proved superb  and all went well with  marianne  thus the lonely little house  nestling amid foliage  was ever  joyous  each sunday in particular proved a joy  for the father did not  then have to go to his office  on the other days he started off early  in the morning  and returned about seven o clock  ever busily laden with  work in the interval  and if his constant perambulations did not affect  his good humor  he was nevertheless often haunted by thoughts of the  future  formerly he had never been alarmed by the penury of his little  home  never had he indulged in any dream of ambition or wealth  besides   he knew that his wife s only idea of happiness  like his own  was to  live there in very simple fashion  leading a brave life of health   peacefulness  and love  but while he did not desire the power procured  by a high position and the enjoyment offered by a large fortune  he  could not help asking himself how he was to provide  were it ever so  modestly  for his increasing family  what would he be able to do  should  he have other children  how would he procure the necessaries of life  each time that a fresh birth might impose fresh requirements upon him   one situated as he was must create resources  draw food from the earth  step by step  each time a little mouth opened and cried its hunger  aloud  otherwise he would be guilty of criminal improvidence  and such  reflections as these came upon him the more strongly as his penury had  increased since the birth of gervais  to such a point  indeed  that  marianne  despite prodigies of economy  no longer knew how to make her  money last her till the end of the month  the slightest expenditure had  to be debated  the very butter had to be spread thinly on the children s  bread  and they had to continue wearing their blouses till they were  well nigh threadbare  to increase the embarrassment they grew every  year  and cost more money  it had been necessary to send the three boys  to a little school at janville  which was as yet but a small expense   but would it not be necessary to send them the following year to a  college  and where was the money for this to come from  a grave problem   a worry which grew from hour to hour  and which for mathieu somewhat  spoilt that charming spring whose advent was flowering the countryside     the worst was that mathieu deemed himself immured  as it were  in his  position as designer at the beauchene works  even admitting that his  salary should some day be doubled  it was not seven or eight thousand  francs a year which would enable him to realize his dream of a numerous  family freely and proudly growing and spreading like some happy forest   indebted solely for strength  health  and beauty to the good common  mother of all  the earth  which gave to all its sap  and this was why   since his return to janville  the earth  the soil had attracted him   detained him during his frequent walks  while he revolved vague but  ever expanding thoughts in his mind  he would pause for long minutes   now before a field of wheat  now on the verge of a leafy wood  now on  the margin of a river whose waters glistened in the sunshine  and now  amid the nettles of some stony moorland  all sorts of vague plans  then rose within him  uncertain reveries of such vast scope  such  singularity  that he had as yet spoken of them to nobody  not even his  wife  others would doubtless have mocked at him  for he had as yet but  reached that dim  quivering hour when inventors feel the gust of their  discovery sweep over them  before the idea that they are revolving  presents itself with full precision to their minds  yet why did he not  address himself to the soil  man s everlasting provider and nurse  why  did he not clear and fertilize those far spreading lands  those woods   those heaths  those stretches of stony ground which were left  sterile around him  since it was just that each man should bring his  contribution to the common weal  create subsistence for himself and his  offspring  why should not he  at the advent of each new child  supply  a new field of fertile earth which would give that child food  without  cost to the community  that was his sole idea  it took no more precise  shape  at the thought of realizing it he was carried off into splendid  dreams     the froments had been in the country fully a month when one evening  marianne  wheeling gervais s little carriage in front of her  came as  far as the bridge over the yeuse to await mathieu  who had promised  to return early  indeed  he got there before six o clock  and as  the evening was fine  it occurred to marianne to go as far as the  lepailleurs  mill down the river  and buy some new laid eggs there      i m willing   said mathieu   i m very fond of their romantic old mill   you know  though if it were mine i should pull it down and build another  one with proper appliances      in the yard of the picturesque old building  half covered with ivy   with its mossy wheel slumbering amid water lilies  they found the  lepailleurs  the man tall  dry  and carroty  the woman as carroty and  as dry as himself  but both of them young and hardy  their child antonin  was sitting on the ground  digging a hole with his little hands      eggs   la lepailleur exclaimed   yes  certainly  madame  there must be  some      she made no haste to fetch them  however  but stood looking at gervais   who was asleep in his little vehicle      ah  so that s your last  he s plump and pretty enough  i must say   she  remarked     but lepailleur raised a derisive laugh  and with the familiarity which  the peasant displays towards the bourgeois whom he knows to be hard up   he said   and so that makes you five  monsieur  ah  well  that would be  a deal too many for poor folks like us       why   mathieu quietly inquired   haven t you got this mill  and don t  you own fields  to give labor to the arms that would come and whose  labor would double and treble your produce      these simple words were like a whipstroke that made lepailleur rear  and  once again he poured forth all his spite  ah  surely now  it wasn t his  tumble down old mill that would ever enrich him  since it had enriched  neither his father nor his grandfather  and as for his fields  well   that was a pretty dowry that his wife had brought him  land in which  nothing more would grow  and which  however much one might water it with  one s sweat  did not even pay for manuring and sowing      but in the first place   resumed mathieu   your mill ought to be  repaired and its old mechanism replaced  or  better still  you should  buy a good steam engine       repair the mill  buy an engine  why  that s madness   the other  replied   what would be the use of it  as it is  people hereabouts have  almost renounced growing corn  and i remain idle every other month       and then   continued mathieu   if your fields yield less  it is because  you cultivate them badly  following the old routine  without proper care  or appliances or artificial manure       appliances  artificial manure  all that humbug which has only sent  poor folks to rack and ruin  ah  i should just like to see you trying to  cultivate the land better  and make it yield what it ll never yield any  more      thereupon he quite lost his temper  became violent and brutal  launching  against the ungrateful earth all the charges which his love of idleness  and his obstinacy suggested  he had travelled  he had fought in africa  as a soldier  folks could not say that he had always lived in his hole  like an ignorant beast  but  none the less  on leaving his regiment he  had lost all taste for work and come to the conclusion that agriculture  was doomed  and would never give him aught but dry bread to eat  the  land would soon be bankrupt  and the peasantry no longer believed in it   so old and empty and worn out had it become  and even the sun got out of  order nowadays  they had snow in july and thunderstorms in december  a  perfect upsetting of seasons  which wrecked the crops almost before they  were out of the ground      no  monsieur   said lepailleur   what you say is impossible  it s all  past  the soil and work  there s nothing left of either  it s barefaced  robbery  and though the peasant may kill himself with labor  he will  soon be left without even water to drink  children indeed  no  no   there s antonin  of course  and for him we may just be able to provide   but i assure you that i won t even make antonin a peasant against his  will  if he takes to schooling and wishes to go to paris  i shall tell  him that he s quite right  for paris is nowadays the only chance for  sturdy chaps who want to make a fortune  so he will be at liberty to  sell everything  if he chooses  and try his luck there  the only thing  that i regret is that i didn t make the venture myself when there was  still time      mathieu began to laugh  was it not singular that he  a bourgeois with  a bachelor s degree and scientific attainments  should dream of coming  back to the soil  to the common mother of all labor and wealth  when  this peasant  sprung from peasants  cursed and insulted the earth  and  hoped that his son would altogether renounce it  never had anything  struck him as more significant  it symbolized that disastrous exodus  from the rural districts towards the towns  an exodus which year by year  increased  unhinging the nation and reducing it to anaemia      you are wrong   he said in a jovial way so as to drive all bitterness  from the discussion   don t be unfaithful to the earth  she s an old  mistress who would revenge herself  in your place i would lay myself out  to obtain from her  by increase of care  all that i might want  as in  the world s early days  she is still the great fruitful spouse  and she  yields abundantly when she is loved in proper fashion      but lepailleur  raising his fists  retorted   no  no  i ve had enough of  her       and  by the way   continued mathieu   one thing which astonishes me  is that no courageous  intelligent man has ever yet come forward to  do something with all that vast abandoned estate yonder  that  chantebled  which old seguin  formerly  dreamt of turning into a  princely domain  there are great stretches of waste land  woods which  one might partly fell  heaths and moorland which might easily be  restored to cultivation  what a splendid task  what a work of creation  for a bold man to undertake      this so amazed lepailleur that he stood there openmouthed  then his  jeering spirit asserted itself   but  my dear sir  excuse my saying  it  you must be mad  cultivate chantebled  clear those stony tracts   wade about in those marshes  why  one might bury millions there  without reaping a single bushel of oats  it s a cursed spot  which my  grandfather s father saw such as it is now  and which my grandson s  son will see just the same  ah  well  i m not inquisitive  but it would  really amuse me to meet the fool who might attempt such madness        mon dieu   who knows   mathieu quietly concluded   when one only loves  strongly one may work miracles      la lepailleur  after going to fetch a dozen eggs  now stood erect  before her husband in admiration at hearing him talk so eloquently to  a bourgeois  they agreed very well together in their avaricious rage at  being unable to amass money by the handful without any great exertion   and in their ambition to make their son a gentleman  since only a  gentleman could become wealthy  and thus  as marianne was going off  after placing the eggs under a cushion in gervais  little carriage  the  other complacently called her attention to antonin  who  having made a  hole in the ground  was now spitting into it      oh  he s smart   said she   he knows his alphabet already  and we are  going to put him to school  if he takes after his father he will be no  fool  i assure you      it was on a sunday  some ten days later  that the supreme revelation   the great flash of light which was to decide his life and that of those  he loved  fell suddenly upon mathieu during a walk he took with his wife  and the children  they had gone out for the whole afternoon  taking a  little snack with them in order that they might share it amid the long  grass in the fields  and after scouring the paths  crossing the copses   rambling over the moorland  they came back to the verge of the woods and  sat down under an oak  thence the whole expanse spread out before them   from the little pavilion where they dwelt to the distant village of  janville  on their right was the great marshy plateau  from which broad   dry  sterile slopes descended  while lower ground stretched away on  their left  then  behind them  spread the woods with deep thickets  parted by clearings  full of herbage which no scythe had ever touched   and not a soul was to be seen around them  there was naught save wild  nature  grandly quiescent under the bright sun of that splendid april  day  the earth seemed to be dilating with all the sap amassed within it   and a flood of life could be felt rising and quivering in the vigorous  trees  the spreading plants  and the impetuous growth of brambles and  nettles which stretched invadingly over the soil  and on all sides a  powerful  pungent odor was diffused      don t go too far   marianne called to the children   we shall stay  under this oak  we will have something to eat by and by      blaise and denis were already bounding along  followed by ambroise  to  see who could run the fastest  but rose pettishly called them back  for  she preferred to play at gathering wild flowers  the open air fairly  intoxicated the youngsters  the herbage rose  here and there  to their  very shoulders  but they came back and gathered flowers  and after  a time they set off at a wild run once more  one of the big brothers  carrying the little sister on his back     mathieu  however  had remained absent minded  with his eyes wandering  hither and thither  throughout their walk  at times he did not hear  marianne when she spoke to him  he lapsed into reverie before some  uncultivated tract  some copse overrun with brushwood  some spring which  suddenly bubbled up and was then lost in mire  nevertheless  she felt  that there was no sadness nor feeling of indifference in his heart  for  as soon as he returned to her he laughed once more with his soft  loving  laugh  it was she who often sent him roaming about the country  even  alone  for she felt that it would do him good  and although she had  guessed that something very serious was passing through his mind  she  retained full confidence  waiting till it should please him to speak to  her     now  however  just as he had sunk once more into his reverie  his glance  wandering afar  studying the great varied expanse of land  she raised a  light cry   oh  look  look      under the big oak tree she had placed master gervais in his little  carriage  among wild weeds which hid its wheels  and while she handed  a little silver mug  from which it was intended they should drink while  taking their snack  she had noticed that the child raised his head and  followed the movement of her hand  in which the silver sparkled beneath  the sun rays  forthwith she repeated the experiment  and again the  child s eyes followed the starry gleam      ah  it can t be said that i m mistaken  and am simply fancying it   she  exclaimed   it is certain that he can see quite plainly now  my pretty  pet  my little darling      she darted to the child to kiss him in celebration of that first clear  glance  and then  too  came the delight of the first smile      why  look   in his turn said mathieu  who was leaning over the child  beside her  yielding to the same feeling of rapture   there he is  smiling at you now  but of course  as soon as these little fellows see  clearly they begin to laugh      she herself burst into a laugh   you are right  he is laughing  ah  how  funny he looks  and how happy i am      both father and mother laughed together with content at the sight of  that infantile smile  vague and fleeting  like a faint ripple on the  pure water of some spring     amid this joy marianne called the four others  who were bounding under  the young foliage around them   come  rose  come  ambroise  come  blaise  and denis  it s time now  come at once to have something to eat      they hastened up and the snack was set out on a patch of soft grass   mathieu unhooked the basket which hung in front of the baby s little  vehicle  and marianne  having drawn some slices of bread and butter from  it  proceeded to distribute them  perfect silence ensued while all four  children began biting with hearty appetite  which it was a pleasure to  see  but all at once a scream arose  it came from master gervais  who  was vexed at not having been served first      ah  yes  it s true i was forgetting you   said marianne gayly   you  shall have your share  there  open your mouth  you darling   and  with  an easy  simple gesture  she unfastened her dress body  and then  under  the sunlight which steeped her in golden radiance  in full view of the  far spreading countryside  where all likewise was bare  the soil  the  trees  the plants  streaming with sap  having seated herself in the long  grass  where she almost disappeared amid the swarming growth of april s  germs  the babe on her breast eagerly sucked in her warm milk  even as  all the encompassing verdure was sucking life from the soil      how hungry you are   she exclaimed   don t pinch me so hard  you little  glutton      meantime mathieu had remained standing amid the enchantment of the  child s first smile and the gayety born of the hearty hunger around him   then his dream of creation came back to him  and he at last gave voice  to those plans for the future which haunted him  and of which he had so  far spoken to nobody   ah  well  it is high time that i should set to  work and found a kingdom  if these children are to have enough soup to  make them grow  shall i tell you what i ve thought  shall i tell you      marianne raised her eyes  smiling and all attention   yes  tell me your  secret if the time has come  oh  i could guess that you had some great  hope in you  but i did not ask you anything  i preferred to wait      he did not give a direct reply  for at a sudden recollection his  feelings rebelled   that lepailleur   said he   is simply a lazy fellow  and a fool in spite of all his cunning airs  can there be any more  sacrilegious folly than to imagine that the earth has lost her  fruitfulness and is becoming bankrupt  she  the eternal mother   eternal life  she only shows herself a bad mother to her bad sons  the  malicious  the obstinate  and the dull witted  who do not know how to  love and cultivate her  but if an intelligent son comes and devotes  himself to her  and works her with the help of experience and all  the new systems of science  you will soon see her quicken and yield  tremendous harvests unceasingly  ah  folks say in the district that this  estate of chantebled has never yielded and never will yield anything but  nettles  well  nevertheless  a man will come who will transform it and  make it a new land of joy and abundance      then  suddenly turning round  with outstretched arm  and pointing to  the spots to which he referred in turn  he went on   yonder in the rear  there are nearly five hundred acres of little woods  stretching as far  as the farms of mareuil and lillebonne  they are separated by clearings  of excellent soil which broad gaps unite  and which could easily be  turned into good pastures  for there are numerous springs  and  indeed   the springs become so abundant on the right  that they have changed that  big plateau into a kind of marshland  dotted with ponds  and planted  with reeds and rushes  but picture a man of bold mind  a clearer  a  conqueror  who should drain those lands and rid them of superfluous  water by means of a few canals which might easily be dug  why  then a  huge stretch of land would be reclaimed  handed over to cultivation  and  wheat would grow there with extraordinary vigor  but that is not all   there is the expanse before us  those gentle slopes from janville to  vieux bourg  that is another five hundred acres  which are left almost  uncultivated on account of their dryness  the stony poverty of their  soil  so it is all very simple  one would merely have to take the  sources up yonder  the waters  now stagnant  and carry them across  those sterile slopes  which  when irrigated  would gradually develop  extraordinary fertility  i have seen everything  i have studied  everything  i feel that there are at least twelve hundred acres of land  which a bold creator might turn into a most productive estate  yonder  lies a whole kingdom of corn  a whole new world to be created by labor   with the help of the beneficent waters and our father the sun  the  source of eternal life      marianne gazed at him and admired him as he stood there quivering   pondering over all that he evoked from his dream  but she was frightened  by the vastness of such hopes  and could not restrain a cry of  disquietude and prudence      no  no  that is too much  you desire the impossible  how can you think  that we shall ever possess so much  that our fortune will spread over  the entire region  think of the capital  the arms that would be needed  for such a conquest      for a moment mathieu remained silent on thus suddenly being brought back  to reality  then with his affectionate  sensible air  he began to laugh    you are right  i have been dreaming and talking wildly   he replied   i  am not yet so ambitious as to wish to be king of chantebled  but there  is truth in what i have said to you  and  besides  what harm can  there be in dreaming of great plans to give oneself faith and courage   meantime i intend to try cultivating just a few acres  which seguin will  no doubt sell me cheaply enough  together with the little pavilion in  which we live  i know that the unproductiveness of the estate weighs on  him  and  later on  we shall see if the earth is disposed to love us and  come to us as we go to her  ah well  my dear  give that little glutton  plenty of life  and you  my darlings  eat and drink and grow in  strength  for the earth belongs to those who are healthy and numerous      blaise and denis made answer by taking some fresh slices of  bread and butter  while rose drained the mug of wine and water  which ambroise handed her  and marianne sat there like the symbol of  blossoming fruitfulness  the source of vigor and conquest  while gervais  heartily nursed on  he pulled so hard  indeed  that one could hear the  sound of his lips  it was like the faint noise which attends the rise  of a spring  a slender rill of milk that is to swell and become a river   around her the mother heard that source springing up and spreading on  all sides  she was not nourishing alone  the sap of april was dilating  the land  sending a quiver through the woods  raising the long herbage  which embowered her  and beneath her  from the bosom of the earth   which was ever in travail  she felt that flood of sap reaching and ever  pervading her  and it was like a stream of milk flowing through the  world  a stream of eternal life for humanity s eternal crop  and on  that gay day of spring the dazzling  singing  fragrant countryside was  steeped in it all  triumphal with that beauty of the mother  who  in the  full light of the sun  in view of the vast horizon  sat there nursing  her child           viii    on the morrow  after a morning s hard toil at his office at the works   mathieu  having things well advanced  bethought himself of going to see  norine at madame bourdieu s  he knew that she had given birth to a child  a fortnight previously  and he wished to ascertain the exact state of  affairs  in order to carry to an end the mission with which beauchene  had intrusted him  as the other  however  had never again spoken to  him on the subject  he simply told him that he was going out in the  afternoon  without indicating the motive of his absence  at the same  time he knew what secret relief beauchene would experience when he at  last learnt that the whole business was at an end  the child cast adrift  and the mother following her own course     on reaching the rue de miromesnil  mathieu had to go up to norine s  room  for though she was to leave the house on the following thursday   she still kept her bed  and at the foot of the bedstead  asleep in a  cradle  he was surprised to see the infant  of which  he thought  she  had already rid herself      oh  is it you   she joyously exclaimed   i was about to write to you   for i wanted to see you before going away  my little sister here would  have taken you the letter      cecile moineaud was indeed there  together with the younger girl  irma   the mother  unable to absent herself from her household duties  had  sent them to make inquiries  and give norine three big oranges  which  glistened on the table beside the bed  the little girls had made the  journey on foot  greatly interested by all the sights of the streets and  the displays in the shop windows  and now they were enraptured with the  fine house in which they found their big sister sojourning  and full of  curiosity with respect to the baby which slept under the cradle s muslin  curtains     mathieu made the usual inquiries of norine  who answered him gayly  but  pouted somewhat at the prospect of having so soon to leave the house   where she had found herself so comfortable      we shan t easily find such soft mattresses and such good food  eh   victoire   she asked  whereupon mathieu perceived that another girl was  present  a pale little creature with wavy red hair  tip tilted nose  and  long mouth  whom he had already seen there on the occasion of a previous  visit  she slept in one of the two other beds which the room contained   and now sat beside it mending some linen  she was to leave the house on  the morrow  having already sent her child to the foundling hospital  and  in the meantime she was mending some things for rosine  the well to do  young person of great beauty whom mathieu had previously espied  and  whose story  according to norine  was so sadly pathetic     victoire ceased sewing and raised her head  she was a servant girl by  calling  one of those unlucky creatures who are overtaken by trouble  when they have scarce arrived in the great city from their native  village   well   said she   it s quite certain that one won t be able  to dawdle in bed  and that one won t have warm milk given one to drink  before getting up  but  all the same  it isn t lively to see nothing but  that big gray wall yonder from the window  and  besides  one can t go on  forever doing nothing      norine laughed and jerked her head  as if she were not of this opinion   then  as her little sisters embarrassed her  she wished to get rid of  them      and so  my pussies   said she   you say that papa s still angry with  me  and that i m not to go back home       oh   cried cecile   it s not so much that he s angry  but he says that  all the neighbors would point their fingers at him if he let you come  home  besides  euphrasie keeps his anger up  particularly since she s  arranged to get married       what  euphrasie going to be married  you didn t tell me that      norine looked very vexed  particularly when her sisters  speaking both  together  told her that the future husband was auguste benard  a jovial  young mason who lived on the floor above them  he had taken a fancy to  euphrasie  though she had no good looks  and was as thin  at eighteen   as a grasshopper  doubtless  however  he considered her strong and  hard working      much good may it do them   said norine spitefully   why  with her evil  temper  she ll be beating him before six months are over  you can just  tell mamma that i don t care a rap for any of you  and that i need  nobody  i ll go and look for work  and i ll find somebody to help me   so  you hear  don t you come back here  i don t want to be bothered by  you any more      at this  irma  but eight years old and tender hearted  began to cry    why do you scold us  we didn t come to worry you  i wanted to ask you   too  if that baby s yours  and if we may kiss it before we go away      norine immediately regretted her spiteful outburst  she once more called  the girls her  little pussies   kissed them tenderly  and told them that  although they must run away now they might come back another day to see  her if it amused them   thank mamma from me for her oranges  and as for  the baby  well  you may look at it  but you mustn t touch it  for if it  woke up we shouldn t be able to hear ourselves      then  as the two children leant inquisitively over the cradle  mathieu  also glanced at it  and saw a healthy  sturdy looking child  with a  square face and strong features  and it seemed to him that the infant  was singularly like beauchene     at that moment  however  madame bourdieu came in  accompanied by  a woman  whom he recognized as sophie couteau   la couteau   that  nurse agent whom he had seen at the seguins  one day when she had gone  thither to offer to procure them a nurse  she also certainly recognized  this gentleman  whose wife  proud of being able to suckle her own  children  had evinced such little inclination to help others to do  business  she pretended  however  that she saw him for the first time   for she was discreet by profession and not even inquisitive  since so  many matters were ever coming to her knowledge without the asking     little cecile and little irma went off at once  and then madame  bourdieu  addressing norine  inquired   well  my child  have you  thought it over  have you quite made up your mind about that poor little  darling  who is sleeping there so prettily  here is the person i spoke  to you about  she comes from normandy every fortnight  bringing nurses  to paris  and each time she takes babies away with her to put them out  to nurse in the country  though you say you won t feed it  you surely  need not cast off your child altogether  you might confide it to this  person until you are in a position to take it back  or else  if you have  made up your mind to abandon it altogether  she will kindly take it to  the foundling hospital at once      great perturbation had come over norine  who let her head fall back on  her pillow  over which streamed her thick fair hair  whilst her face  darkened and she stammered    mon dieu    mon dieu   you are going to  worry me again      then she pressed her hands to her eyes as if anxious to see nothing  more      this is what the regulations require of me  monsieur   said madame  bourdieu to mathieu in an undertone  while leaving the young mother for  a moment to her reflections   we are recommended to do all we can to  persuade our boarders  especially when they are situated like this one   to nurse their infants  you are aware that this often saves not only the  child  but the mother herself  from the sad future which threatens her   and so  however much she may wish to abandon the child  we leave it near  her as long as possible  and feed it with the bottle  in the hope that  the sight of the poor little creature may touch her heart and awaken  feelings of motherliness in her  nine times out of ten  as soon as she  gives the child the breast  she is vanquished  and she keeps it  that is  why you still see this baby here      mathieu  feeling greatly moved  drew near to norine  who still lay back  amid her streaming hair  with her hands pressed to her face   come    said he   you are a goodhearted girl  there is no malice in you  why not  yourself keep that dear little fellow      then she uncovered her burning  tearless face   did the father even come  to see me   she asked bitterly   i can t love the child of a man who  has behaved as he has  the mere thought that it s there  in that cradle   puts me in a rage       but that dear little innocent isn t guilty  it s he whom you condemn   yourself whom you punish  for now you will be quite alone  and he might  prove a great consolation       no  i tell you no  i won t  i can t keep a child like that with nobody  to help me  we all know what we can do  don t we  well  it is of no use  my questioning myself  i m not brave enough  i m not stupid enough to do  such a thing  no  no  and no      he said no more  for he realized that nothing would prevail over that  thirst for liberty which she felt in the depths of her being  with a  gesture he expressed his sadness  but he was neither indignant nor angry  with her  for others had made her what she was      well  it s understood  you won t be forced to feed it   resumed madame  bourdieu  attempting a final effort   but it isn t praiseworthy to  abandon the child  why not trust it to madame here  who would put it out  to nurse  so that you would be able to take it back some day  when you  have found work  it wouldn t cost much  and no doubt the father would  pay      this time norine flew into a passion   he  pay  ah  you don t know  him  it s not that the money would inconvenience him  for he s a  millionnaire  but all he wants is to see the little one disappear  if he  had dared he would have told me to kill it  just ask that gentleman if i  speak the truth  you see that he keeps silent  and how am i to pay  when i haven t a copper  when to morrow i shall be cast out of doors   perhaps  without work and without bread  no  no  a thousand times no  i  can t      then  overcome by an hysterical fit of despair  she burst into sobs    i beg you  leave me in peace  for the last fortnight you have been  torturing me with that child  by keeping him near me  with the idea  that i should end by nursing him  you bring him to me  and set him on my  knees  so that i may look at him and kiss him  you are always worrying  me with him  and making him cry with the hope that i shall pity him and  take him to my breast  but   mon dieu   can t you understand that if i  turn my head away  if i don t want to kiss him or even to see him  it is  because i m afraid of being caught and loving him like a big fool   which would be a great misfortune both for him and for me  he ll be far  happier by himself  so  i beg you  let him be taken away at once  and  don t torture me any more      sobbing violently  she again sank back in bed  and buried her  dishevelled head in the pillows     la couteau had remained waiting  mute and motionless  at the foot of the  bedstead  in her gown of dark woollen stuff and her black cap trimmed  with yellow ribbons she retained the air of a peasant woman in her  sunday best  and she strove to impart an expression of compassionate  good nature to her long  avaricious  false face  although it seemed to  her unlikely that business would ensue  she risked a repetition of her  customary speech      at rougemont  you know  madame  your little one would be just the same  as at home  there s no better air in the department  people come there  from bayeux to recruit their health  and if you only knew how well the  little ones are cared for  it s the only occupation of the district   to have little parisians to coddle and love  and  besides  i wouldn t  charge you dear  i ve a friend of mine who already has three nurslings   and  as she naturally brings them up with the bottle  it wouldn t put  her out to take a fourth for almost next to nothing  come  doesn t that  suit you  doesn t that tempt you      when  however  she saw that tears were norine s only answer  she made  an impatient gesture like an active woman who cannot afford to lose  her time  at each of her fortnightly journeys  as soon as she had rid  herself of her batch of nurses at the different offices  she hastened  round the nurses  establishments to pick up infants  so as to take the  train homewards the same evening together with two or three women who   as she put it  helped her  to cart the little ones about   on this  occasion she was in a greater hurry  as madame bourdieu  who employed  her in a variety of ways  had asked her to take norine s child to the  foundling hospital if she did not take it to rougemont      and so   said la couteau  turning to madame bourdieu   i shall have  only the other lady s child to take back with me  well  i had better  see her at once to make final arrangements  then i ll take this one  and carry it yonder as fast as possible  for my train starts at six  o clock      when la couteau and madame bourdieu had gone off to speak to rosine  who  was the  other lady  referred to  the room sank into silence save for  the wailing and sobbing of norine  mathieu had seated himself near the  cradle  gazing compassionately at the poor little babe  who was still  peacefully sleeping  soon  however  victoire  the little servant girl   who had hitherto remained silent  as if absorbed in her sewing  broke  the heavy silence and talked on slowly and interminably without raising  her eyes from her needle      you were quite right in not trusting your child to that horrid woman    she began   whatever may be done with him at the hospital  he will be  better off there than in her hands  at least he will have a chance to  live  and that s why i insisted  like you  on having mine taken there  at once  you know i belong in that woman s region  yes  i come from  berville  which is barely four miles from rougemont  and i can t help  knowing la couteau  for folks talk enough about her in our village   she s a nice creature and no mistake  and it s a fine trade that she  plies  selling other people s milk  she was no better than she should  be at one time  but at last she was lucky enough to marry a big  coarse   brutal fellow  whom at this time of day she leads by the nose  and he  helps her  yes  he also brings nurses to paris and takes babies back  with him  at busy times  but between them they have more murders  on their consciences than all the assassins that have ever been  guillotined  the mayor of berville  a bourgeois who s retired from  business and a worthy man  said that rougemont was the curse of the  department  i know well enough that there s always been some rivalry  between rougemont and berville  but  the folks of rougemont ply a wicked  trade with the babies they get from paris  all the inhabitants have  ended by taking to it  there s nothing else doing in the whole village   and you should just see how things are arranged so that there may be  as many funerals as possible  ah  yes  people don t keep their  stock in trade on their hands  the more that die  the more they earn   and so one can understand that la couteau always wants to take back as  many babies as possible at each journey she makes      victoire recounted these dreadful things in her simple way  as one  whom paris has not yet turned into a liar  and who says all she knows   careless what it may be      and it seems things were far worse years ago   she continued   i have  heard my father say that  in his time  the agents would bring back four  or five children at one journey  perfect parcels of babies  which they  tied together and carried under their arms  they set them out in rows  on the seats in the waiting rooms at the station  and one day  indeed  a  rougemont agent forgot one child in a waiting room  and there was quite  a row about it  because when the child was found again it was dead   and then you should have seen in the trains what a heap of poor little  things there was  all crying with hunger  it became pitiable in winter  time  when there was snow and frost  for they were all shivering and  blue with cold in their scanty  ragged swaddling clothes  one or another  often died on the way  and then it was removed at the next station and  buried in the nearest cemetery  and you can picture what a state those  who didn t die were in  at our place we care better for our pigs  for we  certainly wouldn t send them travelling in that fashion  my father  used to say that it was enough to make the very stones weep  nowadays   however  there s more supervision  the regulations allow the agents  to take only one nursling back at a time  but they know all sorts of  tricks  and often take a couple  and then  too  they make arrangements   they have women who help them  and they avail themselves of those who  may be going back into the country alone  yes  la couteau has all sorts  of tricks to evade the law  and  besides  all the folks of rougemont  close their eyes  they are too much interested in keeping business  brisk  and all they fear is that the police may poke their noses into  their affairs  ah  it is all very well for the government to send  inspectors every month  and insist on registers  and the mayor s  signature and the stamp of the commune  why  it s just as if it did  nothing  it doesn t prevent these women from quietly plying their trade  and sending as many little ones as they can to kingdom come  we ve got  a cousin at rougemont who said to us one day   la malivoire s precious  lucky  she got rid of four more during last month       victoire paused for a moment to thread her needle  norine was still  weeping  while mathieu listened  mute with horror  and with his eyes  fixed upon the sleeping child      no doubt folks say less about rougemont nowadays than they used to    the girl resumed   but there s still enough to disgust one  we know  three or four baby farmers who are not worth their salt  the rule is  to bring the little ones up with the bottle  you know  and you d be  horrified if you saw what bottles they are  never cleaned  always  filthy  with the milk inside them icy cold in the winter and sour in the  summer  la vimeux  for her part  thinks that the bottle system costs too  much  and so she feeds her children on soup  that clears them off all  the quicker  at la loiseau s you have to hold your nose when you go near  the corner where the little ones sleep  their rags are so filthy  as for  la gavette  she s always working in the fields with her man  so that the  three or four nurslings that she generally has are left in charge of the  grandfather  an old cripple of seventy  who can t even prevent the fowls  from coming to peck at the little ones   and things are worse even at la  cauchois   for  as she has nobody at all to mind the children when she  goes out working  she leaves them tied in their cradles  for fear lest  they should tumble out and crack their skulls  you might visit all the  houses in the village  and you would find the same thing everywhere   there isn t a house where the trade isn t carried on  round our part  there are places where folks make lace  or make cheese  or make cider   but at rougemont they only make dead bodies          there is no exaggeration in what m  zola writes on this subject       i have even read in french government reports of instances in      which nurslings have been devoured by pigs  and it is a well known      saying in france that certain norman and touraine villages are      virtually  paved with little parisians    trans       all at once she ceased sewing  and looked at mathieu with her timid   clear eyes      but the worst of all   she continued   is la couillard  an old thief  who once did six months in prison  and who now lives a little way out  of the village on the verge of the wood  no live child has ever left  la couillard s  that s her specialty  when you see an agent  like la  couteau  for instance  taking her a child  you know at once what s in  the wind  la couteau has simply bargained that the little one shall die   it s settled in a very easy fashion  the parents give a sum of three or  four hundred francs on condition that the little one shall be kept till  his first communion  and you may be quite certain that he dies within  a week  it s only necessary to leave a window open near him  as a nurse  used to do whom my father knew  at winter time  when she had half a  dozen babies in her house  she would set the door wide open and then  go out for a stroll  and  by the way  that little boy in the next room   whom la couteau has just gone to see  she ll take him to la couillard s   i m sure  for i heard the mother  mademoiselle rosine  agree with her  the other day to give her a sum of four hundred francs down on the  understanding that she should have nothing more to do in the matter      at this point victoire ceased speaking  for la couteau came in to fetch  norine s child  norine  who had emerged from her distress during the  servant girl s stories  had ended by listening to them with great  interest  but directly she perceived the agent she once more hid her  face in her pillows  as though she feared to see what was about to  happen  mathieu  on his side  had risen from his chair and stood there  quivering      so it s understood  i m going to take the child   said la couteau    madame bourdieu has given me a slip of paper bearing the date of the  birth and the address  only i ought to have some christian names  what  do you wish the child to be called      norine did not at first answer  then  in a faint distressful voice  she  said   alexandre       alexandre  very well  but you would do better to give the boy a second  christian name  so as to identify him the more readily  if some day you  take it into your head to run after him      it was again necessary to tear a reply from norine   honore   she said      alexandre honore  all right  that last name is yours  is it not   and  the first is the father s  that is settled  and now i ve everything i  need  only it s four o clock already  and i shall never get back in time  for the six o clock train if i don t take a cab  it s such a long way  off  the other side of the luxembourg  and a cab costs money  how shall  we manage          norine is  of course  a diminutive of honorine  which is the      feminine form of honore   trans     while she continued whining  to see if she could not extract a few  francs from the distressed girl  it suddenly occurred to mathieu to  carry out his mission to the very end by driving with her himself to  the foundling hospital  so that he might be in a position to inform  beauchene that the child had really been deposited there  in his  presence  so he told la couteau that he would go down with her  take a  cab  and bring her back      all right  that will suit me  let us be off  it s a pity to wake the  little one  since he s so sound asleep  but all the same  we must pack  him off  since it s decided      with her dry hands  which were used to handling goods of this  description  she caught up the child  perhaps  however  a little  roughly  forgetting her assumed wheedling good nature now that she was  simply charged with conveying it to hospital  and the child awoke and  began to scream loudly      ah  dear me  it won t be amusing if he keeps up this music in the cab   quick  let us be off      but mathieu stopped her   won t you kiss him  norine   he asked     at the very first squeal that sorry mother had dipped yet lower under  her sheets  carrying her hands to her ears  distracted as she was by  the sound of those cries   no  no   she gasped   take him away  take him  away at once  don t begin torturing me again      then she closed her eyes  and with one arm repulsed the child who seemed  to be pursuing her  but when she felt that the agent was laying him on  the bed  she suddenly shuddered  sat up  and gave a wild hasty kiss   which lighted on the little fellow s cap  she had scarcely opened her  tear dimmed eyes  and could have seen but a vague phantom of that poor  feeble creature  wailing and struggling at the decisive moment when he  was being cast into the unknown      you are killing me  take him away  take him away      once in the cab the child suddenly became silent  either the jolting of  the vehicle calmed him  or the creaking of the wheels filled him with  emotion  la couteau  who kept him on her knees  at first remained  silent  as if interested in the people on the footwalks  where the  bright sun was shining  then  all of a sudden  she began to talk   venting her thoughts aloud      that little woman made a great mistake in not trusting the child to me   i should have put him out to nurse properly  and he would have grown up  finely at rougemont  but there  they all imagine that we simply worry  them because we want to do business  but i just ask you  if she had  given me five francs for myself and paid my return journey  would that  have ruined her  a pretty girl like her oughtn t to be hard up for  money  i know very well that in our calling there are some people who  are hardly honest  who speculate and ask for commissions  and then put  out nurslings at cheap rates and rob both the parents and the nurse   it s really not right to treat these dear little things as if they were  goods  poultry or vegetables  when folks do that i can understand that  their hearts get hardened  and that they pass the little ones on from  hand to hand without any more care than if they were stock in trade  but  then  monsieur  i m an honest woman  i m authorized by the mayor of our  village  i hold a certificate of morality  which i can show to anybody   if ever you should come to rougemont  just ask after sophie couteau  there  folks will tell you that i m a hard working woman  and don t owe  a copper to a soul      mathieu could not help looking at her to see how unblushingly she thus  praised herself  and her speech struck him as if it were a premeditated  reply to all that victoire had related of her  for  with the keen scent  of a shrewd peasant woman  she must have guessed that charges had been  brought against her  when she felt that his piercing glance was diving  to her very soul  she doubtless feared that she had not lied with  sufficient assurance  and had somehow negligently betrayed herself  for  she did not insist  but put on more gentleness of manner  and contented  herself with praising rougemont in a general way  saying what a perfect  paradise it was  where the little ones were received  fed  cared for   and coddled as if they were all sons of princes  then  seeing that the  gentleman uttered never a word  she became silent once more  it was  evidently useless to try to win him over  and meantime the cab rolled  and rolled along  streets followed streets  ever noisy and crowded  and  they crossed the seine and at last drew near to the luxembourg  it was  only after passing the palace gardens that la couteau again began      well  it s that young person s own affair if she imagines that her  child will be better off for passing through the foundling  i don t  attack the administration  but you know  monsieur  there s a good deal  to be said on the matter  at rougemont we have a number of nurslings  that it sends us  and they don t grow any better or die less frequently  than the others  well  well  people are free to act as they fancy  but  all the same i should like you to know  as i do  all that goes on in  there      the cab had stopped at the top of the rue denfert rochereau  at a short  distance from the former outer boulevard  a big gray wall stretched out   the frigid facade of a state establishment  and it was through a quiet   simple  unobtrusive little doorway at the end of this wall that la  couteau went in with the child  mathieu followed her  but he did not  enter the office where a woman received the children  he felt too much  emotion  and feared lest he should be questioned  it was  indeed  as if  he considered himself an accomplice in a crime  though la couteau told  him that the woman would ask him nothing  and the strictest secrecy  was always observed  he preferred to wait in an anteroom  which led  to several closed compartments  where the persons who came to deposit  children were placed to wait their turn  and he watched the woman go  off  carrying the little one  who still remained extremely well behaved   with a vacant stare in his big eyes     though the interval of waiting could not have lasted more than twenty  minutes  it seemed terribly long to mathieu  lifeless quietude reigned  in that stern  sad looking anteroom  wainscoted with oak  and pervaded  with the smell peculiar to hospitals  all he heard was the occasional  faint wail of some infant  above which now and then rose a heavy   restrained sob  coming perhaps from some mother who was waiting in one  of the adjoining compartments  and he recalled the  slide  of other  days  the box which turned within the wall  the mother crept up   concealing herself much as possible from view  thrust her baby into  the cavity as into an oven  gave a tug at the bell chain  and then  precipitately fled  mathieu was too young to have seen the real thing   he had only seen it represented in a melodrama at the port st  martin  theatre   but how many stories it recalled  hampers of poor little  creatures brought up from the provinces and deposited at the hospital  by carriers  the stolen babes of duchesses  here cast into oblivion by  suspicious looking men  the hundreds of wretched work girls too who had  here rid themselves of their unfortunate children  now  however  the  children had to be deposited openly  and there was a staff which took  down names and dates  while giving a pledge of inviolable secrecy   mathieu was aware that some few people imputed to the suppression of  the slide system the great increase in criminal offences  but each day  public opinion condemns more and more the attitude of society in former  times  and discards the idea that one must accept evil  dam it in  and  hide it as if it were some necessary sewer  for the only course for a  free community to pursue is to foresee evil and grapple with it  and  destroy it in the bud  to diminish the number of cast off children one  must seek out the mothers  encourage them  succor them  and give them  the means to be mothers in fact as well as in name  at that moment   however  mathieu did not reason  it was his heart that was affected   filled with growing pity and anguish at the thought of all the crime   all the shame  all the grief and distress that had passed through that  anteroom in which he stood  what terrible confessions must have been  heard  what a procession of suffering  ignominy  and wretchedness must  have been witnessed by that woman who received the children in her  mysterious little office  to her all the wreckage of the slums  all the  woe lying beneath gilded life  all the abominations  all the tortures  that remain unknown  were carried  there in her office was the port for  the shipwrecked  there the black hole that swallowed up the offspring of  frailty and shame  and while mathieu s spell of waiting continued he saw  three poor creatures arrive at the hospital  one was surely a work girl   delicate and pretty though she looked  so thin  so pale too  and with  so wild an air that he remembered a paragraph he had lately read in a  newspaper  recounting how another such girl  after forsaking her child   had thrown herself into the river  the second seemed to him to be a  married woman  some workman s wife  no doubt  overburdened with children  and unable to provide food for another mouth  while the third was tall   strong  and insolent   one of those who bring three or four children to  the hospital one after the other  and all three women plunged in  and he  heard them being penned in separate compartments by an attendant  while  he  with stricken heart  realizing how heavily fate fell on some  still  stood there waiting         the  slide  system  which enabled a mother to deposit her child      at the hospital without being seen by those within  ceased to be      employed officially as far back as       but the apparatus was      long preserved intact  and i recollect seeing it in the latter      years of the second empire   cir            when i was often at      the artists  studios in the neighborhood  the aperture through      which children were deposited in the sliding box was close to      the little door of which m  zola speaks   trans     when la couteau at last reappeared with empty arms she said never a  word  and mathieu put no question to her  still in silence  they took  their seats in the cab  and only some ten minutes afterwards  when the  vehicle was already rolling through bustling  populous streets  did the  woman begin to laugh  then  as her companion  still silent and distant   did not condescend to ask her the cause of her sudden gayety  she ended  by saying aloud      do you know why i am laughing  if i kept you waiting a bit longer  it  was because i met a friend of mine  an attendant in the house  just as  i left the office  she s one of those who put the babies out to nurse in  the provinces   well  my friend told me that she was going to rougemont  to morrow with two other attendants  and that among others they would  certainly have with them the little fellow i had just left at the  hospital          there are only about     beds at the hopital des enfants      assistes  and the majority of the children deposited there      are perforce placed out to purse in the country   trans     again did she give vent to a dry laugh which distorted her wheedling  face  and she continued   how comical  eh  the mother wouldn t let me  take the child to rougemont  and now it s going there just the same  ah   some things are bound to happen in spite of everything      mathieu did not answer  but an icy chill had sped through his heart  it  was true  fate pitilessly took its own course  what would become of  that poor little fellow  to what early death  what life of suffering or  wretchedness  or even crime  had he been thus brutally cast     but the cab continued rolling on  and for a long while neither mathieu  nor la couteau spoke again  it was only when the latter alighted in  the rue de miromesnil that she began to lament  on seeing that it was  already half past five o clock  for she felt certain that she would miss  her train  particularly as she still had some accounts to settle and  that other child upstairs to fetch  mathieu  who had intended to keep  the cab and drive to the northern terminus  then experienced a  feeling of curiosity  and thought of witnessing the departure of the  nurse agents  so he calmed la couteau by telling her that if she would  make haste he would wait for her  and as she asked for a quarter of an  hour  it occurred to him to speak to norine again  and so he also went  upstairs     when he entered norine s room he found her sitting up in bed  eating one  of the oranges which her little sisters had brought her  she had all the  greedy instincts of a plump  pretty girl  she carefully detached each  section of the orange  and  her eyes half closed the while  her flesh  quivering under her streaming outspread hair  she sucked one after  another with her fresh red lips  like a pet cat lapping a cup of milk   mathieu s sudden entry made her start  however  and when she recognized  him she smiled faintly in an embarrassed way      it s done   he simply said     she did not immediately reply  but wiped her fingers on her  handkerchief  however  it was necessary that she should say something   and so she began   you did not tell me you would come back  i was not  expecting you  well  it s done  and it s all for the best  i assure you  there was no means of doing otherwise      then she spoke of her departure  asked the young man if he thought she  might regain admittance to the works  and declared that in any case she  should go there to see if the master would have the audacity to turn  her away  thus she continued while the minutes went slowly by  the  conversation had dropped  mathieu scarcely replying to her  when la  couteau  carrying the other child in her arms  at last darted in like  a gust of wind   let s make haste  let s make haste   she cried   they  never end with their figures  they try all they can to leave me without  a copper for myself      but norine detained her  asking   oh  is that rosine s baby  pray do  show it me   then she uncovered the infant s face  and exclaimed   oh   how plump and pretty he is   and she began another sentence   what a  pity  can one have the heart    but then she remembered  paused  and  changed her words   yes  how heartrending it is when one has to forsake  such little angels       good by  take care of yourself   cried la couteau   you will make me  miss my train  and i ve got the return tickets  too  the five others are  waiting for me at the station  ah  what a fuss they would make if i got  there too late      then  followed by mathieu  she hurried away  bounding down the stairs   where she almost fell with her little burden  but soon she threw herself  back in the cab  which rolled off      ah  that s a good job  and what do you say of that young person   monsieur  she wouldn t lay out fifteen francs a month on her own  account  and yet she reproaches that good mademoiselle rosine  who has  just given me four hundred francs to have her little one taken care of  till his first communion  just look at him  a superb child  isn t he   what a pity it is that the finest are often those who die the first      mathieu looked at the infant on the woman s knees  his garments were  very white  of fine texture  trimmed with lace  as if he were some  little condemned prince being taken in all luxury to execution  and the  young man remembered that norine had told him that the child was the  offspring of crime  born amid secrecy  he was now  for a fixed sum   to be handed over to a woman who would quietly suppress him by simply  leaving some door or window wide open  young though the boy was  he  already had a finely formed face  that suggested the beauty of a cherub   and he was very well behaved  he did not raise the faintest wail  but a  shudder swept through mathieu  how abominable     la couteau quickly sprang from the cab as soon as they reached the  courtyard of the st  lazare station   thank you  monsieur  you have been  very kind   said she   and if you will kindly recommend me to any ladies  you may know  i shall be quite at their disposal      then mathieu  having alighted on the pavement in his turn  saw a scene  which detained him there a few moments longer  amid all the scramble of  passengers and luggage  five women of peasant aspect  each carrying an  infant  were darting in a scared  uneasy way hither and thither  like  crows in trouble  with big yellow beaks quivering and black wings  flapping with anxiety  then  on perceiving la couteau  there was one  general caw  and all five swooped down upon her with angry  voracious  mien  and  after a furious exchange of cries and explanations  the six  banded themselves together  and  with cap strings waving and skirts  flying  rushed towards the train  carrying the little ones  like birds  of prey who feared delay in returning to the charnel house     and mathieu remained alone in the great crowd  thus every year did these  crows of ill omen carry off from paris no fewer than        children   who were never  never seen again  ah  that great question of the  depopulation of france  not merely were there those who were resolved  to have no children  not only were infanticide and crime of other kinds  rife upon all sides  but one half of the babes saved from those dangers  were killed  thieves and murderesses  eager for lucre  flocked to the  great city from the four points of the compass  and bore away all the  budding life that their arms could carry in order that they might turn  it to death  they beat down the game  they watched in the doorways  they  sniffed from afar the innocent flesh on which they preyed  and the babes  were carted to the railway stations  the cradles  the wards of hospitals  and refuges  the wretched garrets of poor mothers  without fires and  without bread  all  all were emptied  and the packages were heaped  up  moved carelessly hither and thither  sent off  distributed to be  murdered either by foul deed or by neglect  the raids swept on like  tempest blasts  death s scythe never knew dead season  at every hour it  mowed down budding life  children who might well have lived were taken  from their mothers  the only nurses whose milk would have nourished  them  to be carted away and to die for lack of proper nutriment     a rush of blood warmed mathieu s heart when  all at once  he thought  of marianne  so strong and healthy  who would be waiting for him on the  bridge over the yeuse  in the open country  with their little gervais at  her breast  figures that he had seen in print came back to his mind  in  certain regions which devoted themselves to baby farming the mortality  among the nurslings was fifty per cent  in the best of them it was  forty  and seventy in the worst  it was calculated that in one century  seventeen millions of nurslings had died  over a long period the  mortality had remained at from one hundred to one hundred and twenty  thousand per annum  the most deadly reigns  the greatest butcheries of  the most terrible conquerors  had never resulted in such massacre  it  was a giant battle that france lost every year  the abyss into which her  whole strength sank  the charnel place into which every hope was cast   at the end of it is the imbecile death of the nation  and mathieu   seized with terror at the thought  rushed away  eager to seek  consolation by the side of marianne  amid the peacefulness  the wisdom   and the health which were their happy lot           ix    one thursday morning mathieu went to lunch with dr  boutan in the rooms  where the latter had resided for more than ten years  in the rue de  l universite  behind the palais bourbon  by a contradiction  at which  he himself often laughed  this impassioned apostle of fruitfulness had  remained a bachelor  his extensive practice kept him in a perpetual  hurry  and he had little time free beyond his dejeuner hour   accordingly  whenever a friend wished to have any serious conversation  with him  he preferred to invite him to his modest table  to partake  more or less hastily of an egg  a cutlet  and a cup of coffee     mathieu wished to ask the doctor s advice on a grave subject  after a  couple of weeks  reflection  his idea of experimenting in agriculture   of extricating that unappreciated estate of chantebled from chaos   preoccupied him to such a degree that he positively suffered at not  daring to come to a decision  the imperious desire to create  to produce  life  health  strength  and wealth grew within him day by day  yet  what fine courage and what a fund of hope he needed to venture upon an  enterprise which outwardly seemed so wild and rash  and the wisdom of  which was apparent to himself alone  with whom could he discuss such  a matter  to whom could he confide his doubts and hesitation  when the  idea of consulting boutan occurred to him  he at once asked the doctor  for an appointment  here was such a confidant as he desired  a man  of broad  brave mind  one who worshipped life  who was endowed with  far seeing intelligence  and who would therefore at once look beyond the  first difficulties of execution     as soon as they were face to face on either side of the table  mathieu  began to pour forth his confession  recounting his dream  his poem  as  he called it  and the doctor listened without interrupting  evidently  won over by the young man s growing  creative emotion  when at last  boutan had to express an opinion he replied    mon dieu   my friend  i  can tell you nothing from a practical point of view  for i have never  even planted a lettuce  i will even add that your project seems to me  so hazardous that any one versed in these matters whom you might consult  would assuredly bring forward substantial and convincing arguments to  dissuade you  but you speak of this affair with such superb confidence  and ardor and affection  that i feel convinced you would succeed   moreover  you flatter my own views  for i have long endeavored to show  that  if numerous families are ever to flourish again in france  people  must again love and worship the soil  and desert the towns  and lead a  fruitful fortifying country life  so how can i disapprove your plans   moreover  i suspect that  like all people who ask advice  you simply  came here in the hope that you would find in me a brother ready  in  principle at all events  to wage the same battle      at this they both laughed heartily  then  on boutan inquiring with what  capital he would start operations  mathieu quietly explained that he  did not mean to borrow money and thus run into debt  he would begin   if necessary  with very few acres indeed  convinced as he was of the  conquering power of labor  his would be the head  and he would assuredly  find the necessary arms  his only worry was whether he would be able to  induce seguin to sell him the old hunting box and the few acres round it  on a system of yearly payments  without preliminary disbursement  when  he spoke to the doctor on this subject  the other replied      oh  i think he is very favorably disposed  i know that he would  be delighted to sell that huge  unprofitable estate  for with his  increasing pecuniary wants he is very much embarrassed by it  you  are aware  no doubt  that things are going from bad to worse in his  household      then the doctor broke off to inquire   and our friend beauchene  have  you warned him of your intention to leave the works       why  no  not yet   said mathieu   and i would ask you to keep the  matter private  for i wish to have everything settled before informing  him      lunching quickly  they had now got to their coffee  and the doctor  offered to drive mathieu back to the works  as he was going there  himself  for madame beauchene had requested him to call once a week  in  order that he might keep an eye on maurice s health  not only did  the lad still suffer from his legs  but he had so weak and delicate a  stomach that he had to be dieted severely      it s the kind of stomach one finds among children who have not been  brought up by their own mothers   continued boutan   your plucky wife  doesn t know that trouble  she can let her children eat whatever they  fancy  but with that poor little maurice  the merest trifle  such as  four cherries instead of three  provokes indigestion  well  so it is  settled  i will drive you back to the works  only i must first make a  call in the rue roquepine to choose a nurse  it won t take me long  i  hope  quick  let us be off      when they were together in the brougham  boutan told mathieu that it was  precisely for the seguins that he was going to the nurse agency  there  was a terrible time at the house in the avenue d antin  a few months  previously valentine had given birth to a daughter  and her husband  had obstinately resolved to select a fit nurse for the child himself   pretending that he knew all about such matters  and he had chosen a  big  sturdy young woman of monumental appearance  nevertheless  for two  months past andree  the baby  had been pining away  and the doctor had  discovered  by analyzing the nurse s milk  that it was deficient in  nutriment  thus the child was simply perishing of starvation  to change  a nurse is a terrible thing  and the seguins  house was in a tempestuous  state  the husband rushed hither and thither  banging the doors and  declaring that he would never more occupy himself about anything      and so   added boutan   i have now been instructed to choose a fresh  nurse  and it is a pressing matter  for i am really feeling anxious  about that poor little andree       but why did not the mother nurse her child   asked mathieu     the doctor made a gesture of despair   ah  my dear fellow  you ask me  too much  but how would you have a parisienne of the wealthy bourgeoisie  undertake the duty  the long brave task of nursing a child  when she  leads the life she does  what with receptions and dinners and soirees   and absences and social obligations of all sorts  that little madame  seguin is simply trifling when she puts on an air of deep distress and  says that she would so much have liked to nurse her infant  but that  it was impossible since she had no milk  she never even tried  when her  first child was born she could doubtless have nursed it  but to day   with the imbecile  spoilt life she leads  it is quite certain that she  is incapable of making such an effort  the worst is  my dear fellow   as any doctor will tell you  that after three or four generations of  mothers who do not feed their children there comes a generation that  cannot do so  and so  my friend  we are fast coming  not only in france   but in other countries where the odious wet nurse system is in vogue  to  a race of wretched  degenerate women  who will be absolutely powerless  to nourish their offspring      mathieu then remembered what he had witnessed at madame bourdieu s and  the foundling hospital  and he imparted his impressions to boutan   who again made a despairing gesture  there was a great work of  social salvation to be accomplished  said he  no doubt a number of  philanthropists were trying their best to improve things  but private  effort could not cope with such widespread need  there must be general  measures  laws must be passed to save the nation  the mother must be  protected and helped  even in secrecy  if she asked for it  she must be  cared for  succored  from the earliest period  and right through all the  long months during which she fed her babe  all sorts of establishments  would have to be founded  refuges  convalescent homes  and so forth  and  there must be protective enactments  and large sums of money voted to  enable help to be extended to all mothers  whatever they might be   it was only by such preventive steps that one could put a stop to the  frightful hecatomb of newly born infants  that incessant loss of life  which exhausted the nation and brought it nearer and nearer to death  every day      and   continued the doctor   it may all be summed up in this verity    it is a mother s duty to nurse her child   and  besides  a mother   is she not the symbol of all grandeur  all strength  all beauty  she  represents the eternity of life  she deserves a social culture  she  should be religiously venerated  when we know how to worship motherhood   our country will be saved  and this is why  my friend  i should like a  mother feeding her babe to be adopted as the highest expression of human  beauty  ah  how can one persuade our parisiennes  all our french women   indeed  that woman s beauty lies in being a mother with an infant on her  knees  whenever that fashion prevails  we shall be the sovereign nation   the masters of the world      he ended by laughing in a distressed way  in his despair at being unable  to change manners and customs  aware as he was that the nation could be  revolutionized only by a change in its ideal of true beauty      to sum up  then  i believe in a child being nursed only by its own  mother  every mother who neglects that duty when she can perform it is  a criminal  of course  there are instances when she is physically  incapable of accomplishing her duty  and in that case there is the  feeding bottle  which  if employed with care and extreme cleanliness   only sterilized milk being used  will yield a sufficiently good result   but to send a child away to be nursed means almost certain death  and as  for the nurse in the house  that is a shameful transaction  a source of  incalculable evil  for both the employer s child and the nurse s child  frequently die from it      just then the doctor s brougham drew up outside the nurse agency in the  rue roquepine      i dare say you have never been in such a place  although you are the  father of five children   said boutan to mathieu  gayly      no  i haven t       well  then  come with me  one ought to know everything      the office in the rue roquepine was the most important and the one with  the best reputation in the district  it was kept by madame broquette   a woman of forty  with a dignified if somewhat blotched face  who was  always very tightly laced in a faded silk gown of dead leaf hue  but if  she represented the dignity and fair fame of the establishment in  its intercourse with clients  the soul of the place  the ever busy  manipulator  was her husband  monsieur broquette  a little man with a  pointed nose  quick eyes  and the agility of a ferret  charged with the  police duties of the office  the supervision and training of the nurses   he received them  made them clean themselves  taught them to smile and  put on pleasant ways  besides penning them in their various rooms and  preventing them from eating too much  from morn till night he was ever  prowling about  scolding and terrorizing those dirty  ill behaved  and  often lying and thieving women  the building  a dilapidated private  house  with a damp ground floor  to which alone clients were  admitted  had two upper stories  each comprising six rooms arranged as  dormitories  in which the nurses and their infants slept  there was no  end to the arrivals and departures there  the peasant women were ever  galloping through the place  dragging trunks about  carrying babes in  swaddling clothes  and filling the rooms and the passages with wild  cries and vile odors  and amid all this the house had another inmate   mademoiselle broquette  herminie as she was called  a long  pale   bloodless girl of fifteen  who mooned about languidly among that swarm  of sturdy young women     boutan  who knew the house well  went in  followed by mathieu  the  central passage  which was fairly broad  ended in a glass door  which  admitted one to a kind of courtyard  where a sickly conifer stood on  a round patch of grass  which the dampness rotted  on the right of the  passage was the office  whither madame broquette  at the request of her  customers  summoned the nurses  who waited in a neighboring room   which was simply furnished with a greasy deal table in the centre  the  furniture of the office was some old empire stuff  upholstered in red  velvet  there was a little mahogany centre table  and a gilt clock   then  on the left of the passage  near the kitchen  was the general  refectory  with two long tables  covered with oilcloth  and surrounded  by straggling chairs  whose straw seats were badly damaged  just a  make believe sweep with a broom was given there every day  one could  divine long amassed  tenacious dirt in every dim corner  and the place  reeked with an odor of bad cookery mingled with that of sour milk     when boutan thrust open the office door he saw that madame broquette was  busy with an old gentleman  who sat there inspecting a party of nurses   she recognized the doctor  and made a gesture of regret   no matter  no  matter   he exclaimed   i am not in a hurry  i will wait      through the open door mathieu had caught sight of mademoiselle herminie   the daughter of the house  ensconced in one of the red velvet armchairs  near the window  and dreamily perusing a novel there  while her mother   standing up  extolled her goods in her most dignified way to the old  gentleman  who gravely contemplated the procession of nurses and seemed  unable to make up his mind      let us have a look at the garden   said the doctor  with a laugh     one of the boasts of the establishment  indeed  as set forth in its  prospectus  was a garden and a tree in it  as if there were plenty of  good air there  as in the country  they opened the glass door  and on  a bench near the tree they saw a plump girl  who doubtless had just  arrived  pretending to clean a squealing infant  she herself looked  sordid  and had evidently not washed since her journey  in one corner  there was an overflow of kitchen utensils  a pile of cracked pots and  greasy and rusty saucepans  then  at the other end  a french window gave  access to the nurses  waiting room  and here again there was a nauseous  spectacle of dirt and untidiness     all at once monsieur broquette darted forward  though whence he had come  it was hard to say  at all events  he had seen boutan  who was a client  that needed attention   is my wife busy  then   said he   i cannot allow  you to remain waiting here  doctor  come  come  i pray you      with his little ferreting eyes he had caught sight of the dirty girl  cleaning the child  and he was anxious that his visitors should see  nothing further of a character to give them a bad impression of the  establishment   pray  doctor  follow me   he repeated  and understanding  that an example was necessary  he turned to the girl  exclaiming   what  business have you to be here  why haven t you gone upstairs to wash and  dress  i shall fling a pailful of water in your face if you don t hurry  off and tidy yourself      then he forced her to rise and drove her off  all scared and terrified   in front of him  when she had gone upstairs he led the two gentlemen to  the office entrance and began to complain   ah  doctor  if you only knew  what trouble i have even to get those girls to wash their hands  we who  are so clean  who put all our pride in keeping the house clean  if ever  a speck of dust is seen anywhere it is certainly not my fault      since the girl had gone upstairs a fearful tumult had arisen on the  upper floors  whence also a vile smell descended  some dispute  some  battle  seemed to be in progress  there were shouts and howls  followed  by a furious exchange of vituperation      pray excuse me   at last exclaimed monsieur broquette   my wife will  receive you in a minute      thereupon he slipped off and flew up the stairs with noiseless agility   and directly afterwards there was an explosion  then the house suddenly  sank into death like silence  all that could be heard was the voice  of madame in the office  as  in a very dignified manner  she kept on  praising her goods      well  my friend   said boutan to mathieu  while they walked up and down  the passage   all this  the material side of things  is nothing  what  you should see and know is what goes on in the minds of all these  people  and note that this is a fair average place  there are others  which are real dens  and which the police sometimes have to close  no  doubt there is a certain amount of supervision  and there are severe  regulations which compel the nurses to bring certificates of morality   books setting forth their names  ages  parentage  the situations  they have held  and so on  with other documents on which they have  immediately to secure a signature from the prefecture  where the final  authorization is granted them  but these precautions don t prevent  fraud and deceit of various kinds  the women assert that they have only  recently begun nursing  when they have been doing it for months  they  show you superb children which they have borrowed and which they assert  to be their own  and there are many other tricks to which they resort in  their eagerness to make money      as the doctor and mathieu chatted on  they paused for a moment near the  door of the refectory  which chanced to be open  and there  among other  young peasant women  they espied la couteau hastily partaking of  cold meat  doubtless she had just arrived from rougemont  and  after  disposing of the batch of nurses she had brought with her  was seeking  sustenance for the various visits which she would have to make before  returning home  the refectory  with its wine stained tables and greasy  walls  cast a smell like that of a badly kept sink      ah  so you know la couteau   exclaimed boutan  when mathieu had told  him of his meetings with the woman   then you know the depths of crime   la couteau is an ogress  and yet  think of it  with our fine social  organization  she is more or less useful  and perhaps i myself shall be  happy to choose one of the nurses that she has brought with her      at this moment madame broquette very amiably asked the visitors into her  office  after long reflection  the old gentleman had gone off without  selecting any nurse  but saying that he would return some other time      there are folks who don t know their own minds   said madame broquette  sententiously   it isn t my fault  and i sincerely beg you to excuse me   doctor  if you want a good nurse you will be satisfied  for i have just  received some excellent ones from the provinces  i will show you      herminie  meanwhile  had not condescended to raise her nose from her  novel  she remained ensconced in her armchair  still reading  with  a weary  bored expression on her anaemic countenance  mathieu  after  sitting down a little on one side  contented himself with looking on   while boutan stood erect  attentive to every detail  like a commander  reviewing his troops  and the procession began     having opened a door which communicated with the common room  madame  broquette  assuming the most noble airs  leisurely introduced the pick  of her nurses  in groups of three  each with her infant in her arms   about a dozen were thus inspected  short ones with big heavy limbs  tall  ones suggesting maypoles  dark ones with coarse stiff hair  fair ones  with the whitest of skins  quick ones and slow ones  ugly ones and  others who were pleasant looking  all  however  wore the same nervous   silly smile  all swayed themselves with embarrassed timidity  the  anxious mien of the bondswoman at the slave market  who fears that she  may not find a purchaser  they clumsily tried to put on graceful ways   radiant with internal joy directly a customer seemed to nibble  but  clouding over and casting black glances at their companions when the  latter seemed to have the better chance  out of the dozen the doctor  began by setting three aside  and finally he detained but one  in order  that he might study her more fully      one can see that monsieur le docteur knows his business   madame  broquette allowed herself to say  with a flattering smile   i don t  often have such pearls  but she has only just arrived  otherwise she  would probably have been engaged already  i can answer for her as i  could for myself  for i have put her out before      the nurse was a dark woman of about twenty six  of average height  built  strongly enough  but having a heavy  common face with a hard looking  jaw  having already been in service  however  she held herself fairly  well      so that child is not your first one   asked the doctor      no  monsieur  he s my third      then boutan inquired into her circumstances  studied her papers  took  her into madame broquette s private room for examination  and on his  return make a minute inspection of her child  a strong plump boy  some  three months old  who in the interval had remained very quiet on an  armchair  the doctor seemed satisfied  but he suddenly raised his head  to ask   and that child is really your own       oh  monsieur  where could i have got him otherwise       oh  my girl  children are borrowed  you know      then he paused for a moment  still hesitating and looking at the young  woman  embarrassed by some feeling of doubt  although she seemed to  embody all requirements   and are you all quite well in your family   he  asked   have none of your relatives ever died of chest complaints       never  monsieur       well  of course you would not tell me if they had  your books ought to  contain a page for information of that kind  and you  are you of sober  habits  you don t drink       oh  monsieur      this time the young woman bristled up  and boutan had to calm her   then her face brightened with pleasure as soon as the doctor  with the  gesture of a man who is taking his chance  for however careful one may  be there is always an element of chance in such matters  said to her    well  it is understood  i engage you  if you can send your child away  at once  you can go this evening to the address i will give you  let me  see  what is your name       marie lebleu      madame broquette  who  without presuming to interfere with a doctor   had retained her majestic air which so fully proclaimed the high  respectability of her establishment  now turned towards her daughter    herminie  go to see if madame couteau is still there      then  as the girl slowly raised her pale dreamy eyes without stirring  from her chair  her mother came to the conclusion that she had better  execute the commission herself  a moment later she came back with la  couteau     the doctor was now settling money matters  eighty francs a month for the  nurse  and forty five francs for her board and lodging at the agency and  madame broquette s charges  then there was the question of her child s  return to the country  which meant another thirty francs  without  counting a gratuity to la couteau      i m going back this evening   said the latter   i m quite willing to  take the little one with me  in the avenue d antin  did you say  oh  i  know  there s a lady s maid from my district in that house  marie can  go there at once  when i ve settled my business  in a couple of hours  i  will go and rid her of her baby      on entering the office  la couteau had glanced askance at mathieu   without  however  appearing to recognize him  he had remained on his  chair silently watching the scene  first an inspection as of cattle at  a market  and then a bargaining  the sale of a mother s milk  and by  degrees pity and revolt had filled his heart  but a shudder passed  through him when la couteau turned towards the quiet  fine looking  child  of which she promised to rid the nurse  and once more he pictured  her with her five companions at the st  lazare railway station  each   like some voracious crow  with a new born babe in her clutches  it was  the pillaging beginning afresh  life and hope were again being stolen  from paris  and this time  as the doctor said  a double murder was  threatened  for  however careful one may be  the employer s child often  dies from another s milk  and the nurse s child  carried back into the  country like a parcel  is killed with neglect and indigestible pap     but everything was now settled  and so the doctor and his companion  drove away to grenelle  and there  at the very entrance of the beauchene  works  came a meeting which again filled mathieu with emotion  morange   the accountant  was returning to his work after dejeuner  accompanied by  his daughter reine  both of them dressed in deep mourning  on the morrow  of valerie s funeral  morange had returned to his work in a state of  prostration which almost resembled forgetfulness  it was clear that he  had abandoned all ambitious plans of quitting the works to seek a big  fortune elsewhere  still he could not make up his mind to leave his  flat  though it was now too large for him  besides being too expensive   but then his wife had lived in those rooms  and he wished to remain  in them  and  moreover  he desired to provide his daughter with all  comfort  all the affection of his weak heart was now given to that  child  whose resemblance to her mother distracted him  he would gaze at  her for hours with tears in his eyes  a great passion was springing up  within him  his one dream now was to dower her richly and seek happiness  through her  if indeed he could ever be happy again  thus feelings of  avarice had come to him  he economized with respect to everything that  was not connected with her  and secretly sought supplementary work in  order that he might give her more luxury and increase her dower  without  her he would have died of weariness and self abandonment  she was indeed  fast becoming his very life      why  yes   said she with a pretty smile  in answer to a question which  boutan put to her   it is i who have brought poor papa back  i wanted to  be sure that he would take a stroll before setting to work again  other  wise he shuts himself up in his room and doesn t stir      morange made a vague apologetic gesture  at home  indeed  overcome as  he was by grief and remorse  he lived in his bedroom in the company of  a collection of his wife s portraits  some fifteen photographs  showing  her at all ages  which he had hung on the walls      it is very fine to day  monsieur morange   said boutan   you do right  in taking a stroll      the unhappy man raised his eyes in astonishment  and glanced at the  sun as if he had not previously noticed it   that is true  it is fine  weather  and besides it is very good for reine to go out a little      then he tenderly gazed at her  so charming  so pink and white in her  black mourning gown  he was always fearing that she must feel bored  during the long hours when he left her at home  alone with the servant   to him solitude was so distressful  so full of the wife whom he mourned   and whom he accused himself of having killed      papa won t believe that one never feels  ennui  at my age   said the  girl gayly   since my poor mamma is no longer there  i must needs be  a little woman  and  besides  the baroness sometimes calls to take me  out      then she gave a shrill cry on seeing a brougham draw up close to the  curb  a woman was leaning out of the window  and she recognized her      why  papa  there is the baroness  she must have gone to our house  and  clara must have told her that i had accompanied you here      this  indeed  was what had happened  morange hastily led reine to the  carriage  from which seraphine did not alight  and when his daughter  had sprung in joyously  he remained there another moment  effusively  thanking the baroness  and delighted to think that his dear child  was going to amuse herself  then  after watching the brougham till it  disappeared  he entered the factory  looking suddenly aged and shrunken   as if his grief had fallen on his shoulders once more  so overwhelming  him that he quite forgot the others  and did not even take leave of  them      poor fellow   muttered mathieu  who had turned icy cold on seeing  seraphine s bright mocking face and red hair at the carriage window     then he was going to his office when beauchene beckoned to him from one  of the windows of the house to come in with the doctor  the pair of  them found constance and maurice in the little drawing room  whither  the father had repaired to finish his coffee and smoke a cigar  boutan  immediately attended to the child  who was much better with respect  to his legs  but who still suffered from stomachic disturbance  the  slightest departure from the prescribed diet leading to troublesome  complications     constance  though she did not confess it  had become really anxious  about the boy  and questioned the doctor  and listened to him with all  eagerness  while she was thus engaged beauchene drew mathieu on one  side      i say   he began  laughing   why did you not tell me that everything  was finished over yonder  i met the pretty blonde in the street  yesterday      mathieu quietly replied that he had waited to be questioned in order to  render an account of his mission  for he had not cared to be the first  to raise such a painful subject  the money handed to him for expenses  had proved sufficient  and whenever the other desired it  he could  produce receipts for his various disbursements  he was already entering  into particulars when beauchene jovially interrupted him      you know what happened here  she had the audacity to come and ask for  work  not of me of course  but of the foreman of the women s work room   fortunately i had foreseen this and had given strict orders  so the  foreman told her that considerations of order and discipline prevented  him from taking her back  her sister euphrasie  who is to be married  next week  is still working here  just fancy them having another set to   besides  her place is not here      then he went to take a little glass of cognac which stood on the  mantelpiece     mathieu had learnt only the day before that norine  on leaving madame  bourdieu s  had sought a temporary refuge with a female friend  not  caring to resume a life of quarrelling at her parents  home  besides  her attempt to regain admittance at beauchene s  she had applied at two  other establishments  but  as a matter of fact  she did not evince any  particular ardor in seeking to obtain work  four months  idleness and  coddling had altogether disgusted her with a factory hand s life  and  the inevitable was bound to happen  indeed beauchene  as he came back  sipping his cognac  resumed   yes  i met her in the street  she was  quite smartly dressed  and leaning on the arm of a big  bearded young  fellow  who did nothing but make eyes at her  it was certain to come to  that  you know  i always thought so      then he was stepping towards his wife and the doctor  when he remembered  something else  came back  and asked mathieu in a yet lower tone   what  was it you were telling me about the child   and as soon as mathieu had  related that he had taken the infant to the foundling hospital so as  to be certain that it was deposited there  he warmly pressed his hand    that s perfect  thank you  my dear fellow  i shall be at peace now      he felt  indeed  intensely relieved  hummed a lively air  and then took  his stand before constance  who was still consulting the doctor  she  was holding little maurice against her knees  and gazing at him with the  jealous love of a good bourgeoise  who carefully watched over the health  of her only son  that son whom she wished to make a prince of industry  and wealth  all at once  however  in reply to a remark from boutan  she  exclaimed   why then  doctor  you think me culpable  you really say that  a child  nursed by his mother  always has a stronger constitution than  others  and can the better resist the ailments of childhood       oh  there is no doubt of it  madame      beauchene  ceasing to chew his cigar  shrugged his shoulders  and burst  into a sonorous laugh   oh  don t you worry  that youngster will live  to be a hundred  why  the burgundian who nursed him was as strong as a  rock  but  i say  doctor  you intend then to make the chambers pass a  law for obligatory nursing by mothers      at this sally boutan also began to laugh   well  why not   said he     this at once supplied beauchene with material for innumerable jests   why  such a law would completely upset manners and customs  social life  would be suspended  and drawing rooms would become deserted  posters  would be placarded everywhere bearing the inscription   closed on  account of nursing       briefly   said beauchene  in conclusion   you want to have a  revolution       a revolution  yes   the doctor gently replied   and we will effect it            x    mathieu finished studying his great scheme  the clearing and cultivation  of chantebled  and at last  contrary to all prudence but with all the  audacity of fervent faith and hope  it was resolved upon  he warned  beauchene one morning that he should leave the works at the end of the  month  for on the previous day he had spoken to seguin  and had found  him quite willing to sell the little pavilion and some fifty acres  around it on very easy terms  as mathieu had imagined  seguin s affairs  were in a very muddled state  for he had lost large sums at the gaming  table and spent money recklessly on women  leading indeed a most  disastrous life since trouble had arisen in his home  and so he welcomed  the transaction which mathieu proposed to him  in the hope that the  young man would end by ridding him of the whole of that unprofitable  estate should his first experiment prove successful  then came other  interviews between them  and seguin finally consented to sell on a  system of annual payments  spread over a term of years  the first to be  made in two years  time from that date  as things stood  the property  seemed likely to remain unremunerative forever  and so there was nothing  risked in allowing the purchaser a couple of years  credit  however   they agreed to meet once more and settle the final details before a  formal deed of sale was drawn up  and one monday morning  therefore   about ten o clock  mathieu set out for the house in the avenue d antin  in order to complete the business     that morning  as it happened  celeste the maid received in the linen  room  where she usually remained  a visit from her friend madame menoux   the little haberdasher of the neighborhood  in whose tiny shop she was  so fond of gossiping  they had become more intimate than ever since  la couteau  at celeste s instigation  had taken madame menoux s child   pierre  to rougemont  to be put out to nurse there in the best possible  way for the sum of thirty francs a month  la couteau had also very  complaisantly promised to call each month at one or another of her  journeys in order to receive the thirty francs  thereby saving the  mother the trouble of sending the money by post  and also enabling her  to obtain fresh news of her child  thus  each time a payment became  due  if la couteau s journey happened to be delayed a single day  madame  menoux grew terribly frightened  and hastened off to celeste to make  inquiries of her  and  moreover  she was glad to have an opportunity of  conversing with this girl  who came from the very part where her little  pierre was being reared      you will excuse  me  won t you  mademoiselle  for calling so early    said she   but you told me that your lady never required you before nine  o clock  and i ve come  you know  because i ve had no news from over  yonder  and it occurred to me that you perhaps might have received a  letter      blonde  short and thin  madame menoux  who was the daughter of a poor  clerk  had a slender pale face  and a pleasant  but somewhat sad   expression  from her own slightness of build probably sprang her  passionate admiration for her big  handsome husband  who could have  crushed her between his fingers  if she was slight  however  she was  endowed with unconquerable tenacity and courage  and she would have  killed herself with hard work to provide him with the coffee and cognac  which he liked to sip after each repast      ah  it s hard   she continued   to have had to send our pierre so far  away  as it is  i don t see my husband all day  and now i ve a child  whom i never see at all  but the misfortune is that one has to live  and  how could i have kept the little fellow in that tiny shop of mine  where  from morning till night i never have a moment to spare  yet  i can t  help crying at the thought that i wasn t able to keep and nurse him   when my husband comes home from the museum every evening  we do nothing  but talk about him  like a pair of fools  and so  according to you   mademoiselle  that place rougemont is very healthy  and there are never  any nasty illnesses about there      but at this moment she was interrupted by the arrival of another early  visitor  whose advent she hailed with a cry of delight      oh  how happy i am to see you  madame couteau  what a good idea it was  of mine to call here      amid exclamations of joyous surprise  the nurse agent explained that she  had arrived by the night train with a batch of nurses  and had started  on her round of visits as soon as she had deposited them in the rue  roquepine      after bidding celeste good day in passing   said she   i intended to  call on you  my dear lady  but since you are here  we can settle our  accounts here  if you are agreeable      madame menoux  however  was looking at her very anxiously   and how is  my little pierre   she asked      why  not so bad  not so bad  he is not  you know  one of the  strongest  one can t say that he s a big child  only he s so pretty and  nice looking with his rather pale face  and it s quite certain that if  there are bigger babies than he is  there are smaller ones too      she spoke more slowly as she proceeded  and carefully sought words which  might render the mother anxious  without driving her to despair  these  were her usual tactics in order to disturb her customers  hearts  and  then extract as much money from them as possible  on this occasion she  must have guessed that she might carry things so far as to ascribe a  slight illness to the child      however  i must really tell you  because i don t know how to lie  and  besides  after all  it s my duty  well  the poor little darling has been  ill  and he s not quite well again yet      madame menoux turned very pale and clasped her puny little hands    mon  dieu   he will die of it       no  no  since i tell you that he s already a little better  and  certainly he doesn t lack good care  you should just see how la loiseau  coddles him  when children are well behaved they soon get themselves  loved  and the whole house is at his service  and no expense is spared  the doctor came twice  and there was even some medicine  and that costs  money      the last words fell from la couteau s lips with the weight of a club   then  without leaving the scared  trembling mother time to recover  the  nurse agent continued   shall we go into our accounts  my dear lady      madame menoux  who had intended to make a payment before returning to  her shop  was delighted to have some money with her  they looked for  a slip of paper on which to set down the figures  first the month s  nursing  thirty francs  then the doctor  six francs  and indeed  with  the medicine  that would make ten francs      ah  and besides  i meant to tell you   added la couteau   that so much  linen was dirtied during his illness that you really ought to add three  francs for the soap  that would only be just  and besides  there were  other little expenses  sugar  and eggs  so that in your place  to act  like a good mother  i should put down five francs  forty five francs  altogether  will that suit you      in spite of her emotion madame menoux felt that she was being robbed   that the other was speculating on her distress  she made a gesture of  surprise and revolt at the idea of having to give so much money  that  money which she found so hard to earn  no end of cotton and needles had  to be sold to get such a sum together  and her distress  between the  necessity of economy on the one hand and her maternal anxiety on the  other  would have touched the hardest heart      but that will make another half month s money   said she     at this la couteau put on her most frigid air   well  what would you  have  it isn t my fault  one can t let your child die  so one must incur  the necessary expenses  and then  if you haven t confidence in me  say  so  send the money and settle things direct  indeed  that will greatly  relieve me  for in all this i lose my time and trouble  but then  i m  always stupid enough to be too obliging      when madame menoux  again quivering and anxious  had given way  another  difficulty arose  she had only some gold with her  two twenty franc  pieces and one ten franc piece  the three coins lay glittering on the  table  la couteau looked at them with her yellow fixed eyes      well  i can t give you your five francs change   she said   i haven t  any change with me  and you  celeste  have you any change for this  lady      she risked asking this question  but put it in such a tone and with such  a glance that the other immediately understood her   i have not a copper  in my pocket   she replied     deep silence fell  then  with bleeding heart and a gesture of cruel  resignation  madame menoux did what was expected of her      keep those five francs for yourself  madame couteau  since you have to  take so much trouble  and   mon dieu   may all this money bring me  good luck  and at least enable my poor little fellow to grow up a fine  handsome man like his father       oh  as for that i ll warrant it   cried the other  with enthusiasm    those little ailments don t mean anything  on the contrary  i see  plenty of little folks  i do  and so just remember what i tell you   yours will become an extraordinarily fine child  there won t be better      when madame menoux went off  la couteau had lavished such flattery and  such promises upon her that she felt quite light and gay  no longer  regretting her money  but dreaming of the day when little pierre would  come back to her with plump cheeks and all the vigor of a young oak     as soon as the door had closed behind the haberdasher  celeste began  to laugh in her impudent way   what a lot of fibs you told her  i don t  believe that her child so much as caught a cold   she exclaimed     la couteau began by assuming a dignified air   say that i m a liar at  once  the child isn t well  i assure you      the maid s gayety only increased at this   well now  you are really  comical  putting on such airs with me  i know you  remember  and i know  what is meant when the tip of your nose begins to wriggle       the child is quite puny   repeated her friend  more gently      oh  i can believe that  all the same i should like to see the doctor s  prescriptions  and the soap and the sugar  but  you know  i don t care  a button about the matter  as for that little madame menoux  it s here  to day and gone to morrow  she has her business  and i have mine  and  you  too  have yours  and so much the better if you get as much out of  it as you can      but la couteau changed the conversation by asking the maid if she could  not give her a drop of something to drink  for night travelling did  upset her stomach so  thereupon celeste  with a laugh  took a bottle  half full of malaga and a box of biscuits from the bottom of a cupboard   this was her little secret store  stolen from the still room  then  as  the other expressed a fear that her mistress might surprise them  she  made a gesture of insolent contempt  her mistress  why  she had her nose  in her basins and perfumery pots  and wasn t at all likely to call till  she had fixed herself up so as to look pretty      there are only the children to fear   added celeste   that gaston and  that lucie  a couple of brats who are always after one because their  parents never trouble about them  but let them come and play here or in  the kitchen from morning till night  and i don t dare lock this door   for fear they should come rapping and kicking at it      when  by way of precaution  she had glanced down the passage and they  had both seated themselves at table  they warmed and spoke out their  minds  soon reaching a stage of easy impudence and saying everything  as if quite unconscious how abominable it was  while sipping her wine  celeste asked for news of the village  and la couteau spoke the brutal  truth  between two biscuits  it was at the vimeux  house that the  servant s last child  born in la rouche s den  had died a fortnight  after arriving at rougemont  and the vimeux  who were more or less her  cousins  had sent her their friendly remembrances and the news that they  were about to marry off their daughter  then  at la gavette s  the old  grandfather  who looked after the nurslings while the family was at  work in the fields  had fallen into the fire with a baby in his arms   fortunately they had been pulled out of it  and only the little one had  been roasted  la cauchois  though at heart she wasn t downcast  now had  some fears that she might be worried  because four little ones had gone  off from her house all in a body  a window being forgetfully left open  at night time  they were all four little parisians  it seemed  two  foundlings and two that had come from madame bourdieu s  since the  beginning of the year as many had died at rougemont as had arrived  there  and the mayor had declared that far too many were dying  and  that the village would end by getting a bad reputation  one thing was  certain  la couillard would be the very first to receive a visit from  the gendarmes if she didn t so arrange matters as to keep at least one  nursling alive every now and then      ah  that couillard   added the nurse agent   just fancy  my dear  i  took her a child  a perfect little angel  the boy of a very pretty young  person who was stopping at madame bourdieu s  she paid four hundred  francs to have him brought up until his first communion  and he lived  just five days  really now  that wasn t long enough  la couillard need  not have been so hasty  it put me in such a temper  i asked her if she  wanted to dishonor me  what will ruin me is my good heart  i don t know  how to refuse when folks ask me to do them a service  and god in heaven  knows how fond i am of children  i ve always lived among them  and in  future  if anybody who s a friend of mine gives me a child to put out to  nurse  i shall say   we won t take the little one to la couillard  for  it would be tempting providence  but after all  i m an honest woman  and  i wash my hands of it  for if i do take the cherubs over yonder i  don t nurse them  and when one s conscience is at ease one can sleep  quietly        of course   chimed in celeste  with an air of conviction     while they thus waxed maudlin over their malaga  there arose a horrible  red vision  a vision of that terrible rougemont  paved with little  parisians  the filthy  bloody village  the charnel place of cowardly  murder  whose steeple pointed so peacefully to the skies in the midst of  the far spreading plain     but all at once a rush was heard in the passage  and the servant  hastened to the door to rid herself of gaston and lucie  who were  approaching   be off  i don t want you here  your mamma has told you  that you mustn t come here      then she came back into the room quite furious   that s true   said she    i can do nothing but they must come to bother me  why don t they stay a  little with the nurse       oh  by the way   interrupted la couteau   did you hear that marie  lebleu s little one is dead  she must have had a letter about it  such  a fine child it was  but what can one expect  it s a nasty wind  passing  and then you know the saying   a nurse s child is the child of  sacrifice        yes  she told me she had heard of it   replied celeste   but she begged  me not to mention it to madame  as such things always have a bad effect   the worst is that if her child s dead madame s little one isn t much  better off      at this la couteau pricked up her ears   ah  so things are not  satisfactory       no  indeed  it isn t on account of her milk  that s good enough  and  she has plenty of it  only you never saw such a creature  such a temper   always brutal and insolent  banging the doors and talking of smashing  everything at the slightest word  and besides  she drinks like a pig  as  no woman ought to drink      la couteau s pale eyes sparkled with gayety  and she briskly nodded her  head as if to say that she knew all this and had been expecting it  in  that part of normandy  in and around rougemont  all the women drank more  or less  and the girls even carried little bottles of brandy to school  with them in their baskets  marie lebleu  however  was a woman of the  kind that one picks up under the table  and  indeed  it might be said  that since the birth of her last child she had never been quite sober      i know her  my dear   exclaimed la couteau   she is impossible  but  then  that doctor who chose her didn t ask my opinion  and  besides  it  isn t a matter that concerns me  i simply bring her to paris and take  her child back to the country  i know nothing about anything else  let  the gentlefolks get out of their trouble by themselves      this sentiment tickled celeste  who burst out laughing   you haven t an  idea   said she   of the infernal life that marie leads here  she fights  people  she threw a water bottle at the coachman  she broke a big vase  in madame s apartments  she makes them all tremble with constant dread  that something awful may happen  and  then  if you knew what tricks she  plays to get something to drink  for it was found out that she drank   and all the liqueurs were put under lock and key  so you don t know  what she devised  well  last week she drained a whole bottle of eau de  melisse  and was ill  quite ill  from it  another time she was caught  sipping some eau de cologne from one of the bottles in madame s  dressing room  i now really believe that she treats herself to some of  the spirits of wine that are given her for the warmer   it s enough to  make one die of laughing  i m always splitting my sides over it  in my  little corner      then she laughed till the tears came into her eyes  and la couteau  on  her side highly amused  began to wriggle with a savage delight  all at  once  however  she calmed down and exclaimed   but  i say  they will  turn her out of doors       oh  that won t be long  they would have done so already if they had  dared      but at this moment the ringing of a bell was heard  and an oath escaped  celeste   good  there s madame ringing for me now  one can never be at  peace for a moment      la couteau  however  was already standing up  quite serious  intent on  business and ready to depart      come  little one  don t be foolish  you must do your work  for my part  i have an idea  i ll run to fetch one of the nurses whom i brought this  morning  a girl i can answer for as for myself  in an hour s time i ll  be back here with her  and there will be a little present for you if you  help me to get her the situation      she disappeared while the maid  before answering a second ring   leisurely replaced the malaga and the biscuits at the bottom of the  cupboard     at ten o clock that day seguin was to take his wife and their friend  santerre to mantes  to lunch there  by way of trying an electric  motor car  which he had just had built at considerable expense  he had  become fond of this new  sport   less from personal taste  however  than  from his desire to be one of the foremost in taking up a new fashion   and a quarter of an hour before the time fixed for starting he was  already in his spacious  cabinet   arrayed in what he deemed an  appropriate costume  a jacket and breeches of greenish ribbed velvet   yellow shoes  and a little leather hat  and he poked fun at santerre  when the latter presented himself in town attire  a light gray suit of  delicate effect     soon after valentine had given birth to her daughter andree  the  novelist had again become a constant frequenter of the house in the  avenue d antin  he was intent on resuming the little intrigue that he  had begun there and felt confident of victory  valentine  on her side   after a period of terror followed by great relief  had set about making  up for lost time  throwing herself more wildly than ever into the vortex  of fashionable life  she had recovered her good looks and youthfulness   and had never before experienced such a desire to divert herself   leaving her children more and more to the care of servants  and going  about  hither and thither  as her fancy listed  particularly since her  husband did the same in his sudden fits of jealousy and brutality  which  broke out every now and again in the most imbecile fashion without the  slightest cause  it was the collapse of all family life  with the threat  of a great disaster in the future  and santerre lived there in the midst  of it  helping on the work of destruction     he gave a cry of rapture when valentine at last made her appearance  gowned in a delicious travelling dress  with a cavalier toque on her  head  but she was not quite ready  for she darted off again  saying that  she would be at their service as soon as she had seen her little andree   and given her last orders to the nurse      well  make haste   cried her husband   you are quite unbearable  you  are never ready      it was at this moment that mathieu called  and seguin received him in  order to express his regret that he could not that day go into business  matters with him  nevertheless  before fixing another appointment  he  was willing to take note of certain conditions which the other wished to  stipulate for the purpose of reserving to himself the exclusive right  of purchasing the remainder of the chantebled estate in portions and  at fixed dates  seguin was promising that he would carefully study this  proposal when he was cut short by a sudden tumult  distant shouts  wild  hurrying to and fro  and a violent banging of doors      why  what is it  what is it   he muttered  turning towards the shaking  walls     the door suddenly opened and valentine reappeared  distracted  red with  fear and anger  and carrying her little andree  who wailed and struggled  in her arms      there  there  my pet   gasped the mother   don t cry  she shan t hurt  you any more  there  it s nothing  darling  be quiet  do      then she deposited the little girl in a large armchair  where she at  once became quiet again  she was a very pretty child  but still so puny   although nearly four months old  that there seemed to be nothing but her  beautiful big eyes in her pale little face      well  what is the matter   asked seguin  in astonishment      the matter  is  my friend  that i have just found marie lying across  the cradle as drunk as a market porter  and half stifling the child  if  i had been a few moments later it would have been all over  drunk at ten  o clock in the morning  can one understand such a thing  i had noticed  that she drank  and so i hid the liqueurs  for i hoped to be able to  keep her  since her milk is so good  but do you know what she had  drunk  why  the methylated spirits for the warmer  the empty bottle had  remained beside her       but what did she say to you       she simply wanted to beat me  when i shook her  she flew at me in a  drunken fury  shouting abominable words  and i had time only to escape  with the little one  while she began barricading herself in the room   where she is now smashing the furniture  there  just listen      indeed  a distant uproar of destruction reached them  they looked one at  the other  and deep silence fell  full of embarrassment and alarm      and then   seguin ended by asking in his curt dry voice      well  what can i say  that woman is a brute beast  and i can t leave  andree in her charge to be killed by her  i have brought the child here   and i certainly shall not take her back  i will even own that i won t  run the risk of going back to the room  you will have to turn the girl  out of doors  after paying her wages       i  i   cried seguin  then  walking up and down as if spurring on the  anger which was rising within him  he burst forth   i ve had enough  you  know  of all these idiotic stories  this house has become a perfect  hell upon earth all through that child  there will soon be nothing but  fighting here from morning till night  first of all it was pretended  that the nurse whom i took the trouble to choose wasn t healthy  well   then a second nurse is engaged  and she gets drunk and stifles the  child  and now  i suppose  we are to have a third  some other vile  creature who will prey on us and drive us mad  no  no  it s too  exasperating  i won t have it      valentine  her fears now calmed  became aggressive   what won t you  have  there is no sense in what you say  as we have a child we must have  a nurse  if i had spoken of nursing the little one myself you would have  told me i was a fool  you would have found the house more uninhabitable  than ever  if you had seen me with the child always in my arms  but  i won t nurse  i can t  as you say  we will take a third nurse  it s  simple enough  and we ll do so at once and risk it      seguin had abruptly halted in front of andree  who  alarmed by the sight  of his stern dark figure began to cry  blinded as he was by anger  he  perhaps failed to see her  even as he failed to see gaston and lucie   who had hastened in at the noise of the dispute and stood near the door   full of curiosity and fear  as nobody thought of sending them away they  remained there  and saw and heard everything      the carriage is waiting   resumed seguin  in a voice which he strove to  render calm   let us make haste  let us go      valentine looked at him in stupefaction   come  be reasonable   said  she   how can i leave this child when i have nobody to whom i can trust  her       the carriage is waiting for us   he repeated  quivering   let us go at  once      and as his wife this time contented herself with shrugging her  shoulders  he was seized with one of those sudden fits of madness which  impelled him to the greatest violence  even when people were present   and made him openly display his rankling poisonous sore  that absurd  jealousy which had upset his life  as for that poor little puny  wailing  child  he would have crushed her  for he held her to be guilty of  everything  and indeed it was she who was now the obstacle to that  excursion he had planned  that pleasure trip which he had promised  himself  and which now seemed to him of such supreme importance  and   twas so much the better if friends were there to hear him  so in the  vilest language he began to upbraid his wife  not only reproaching her  for the birth of that child  but even denying that the child was his    you will only be content when you have driven me from the house   he  finished in a fury   you won t come  well then  i ll go by myself      and thereupon he rushed off like a whirlwind  without a word to  santerre  who had remained silent  and without even remembering  that mathieu still stood there awaiting an answer  the latter  in  consternation at hearing all these things  had not dared to withdraw  lest by doing so he should seem to be passing judgment on the scene   standing there motionless  he turned his head aside  looked at little  andree who was still crying  and at gaston and lucie  who  silent with  fright  pressed one against the other behind the armchair in which their  sister was wailing     valentine had sunk upon a chair  stifling with sobs  her limbs  trembling   the wretch  ah  how he treats me  to accuse me thus  when  he knows how false it is  ah  never more  no  never more  i would rather  kill myself  yes  kill myself      then santerre  who had hitherto stood on one side  gently drew near  to her and ventured to take her hand with a gesture of affectionate  compassion  while saying in an undertone   come  calm yourself  you know  very well that you are not alone  that you are not forsaken  there are  some things which cannot touch you  calm yourself  cease weeping  i beg  you  you distress me dreadfully      he made himself the more gentle since the husband had been the more  brutal  and he leant over her yet the more closely  and again lowered  his voice till it became but a murmur  only a few words could be heard    it is wrong of you to worry yourself like this  forget all that folly   i told you before that he doesn t know how to behave towards a woman      twice was that last remark repeated with a sort of mocking pity  and she  smiled vaguely amid her drying tears  in her turn murmuring   you are  kind  you are  thank you  and you are quite right     ah  if i could  only be a little happy      then mathieu distinctly saw her press santerre s hand as if in  acceptance of his consolation  it was the logical  fatal outcome of the  situation  given a wife whom her husband had perverted  a mother who  refused to nurse her babe  and yet a cry from andree suddenly set  valentine erect  awaking to the reality of her position  if that poor  creature were so puny  dying for lack of her mother s milk  the mother  also was in danger from her refusal to nurse her and clasp her to her  breast like a buckler of invincible defence  life and salvation one  through the other  or disaster for both  such was the law  and doubtless  valentine became clearly conscious of her peril  for she hastened to  take up the child and cover her with caresses  as if to make of her a  protecting rampart against the supreme madness to which she had felt  prompted  and great was the distress that came over her  her other  children were there  looking and listening  and mathieu also was still  waiting  when she perceived him her tears gushed forth again  and she  strove to explain things  and even attempted to defend her husband      excuse him  there are moments when he quite loses his head   mon dieu    what will become of me with this child  yet i can t nurse her now  it is  too late  it is frightful to be in such a position without knowing what  to do  ah  what will become of me  good lord      santerre again attempted to console her  but she no longer listened to  him  and he was about to defer all further efforts till another time  when unexpected intervention helped on his designs     celeste  who had entered noiselessly  stood there waiting for her  mistress to allow her to speak   it is my friend who has come to see  me  madame   said she   you know  the person from my village  sophie  couteau  and as she happens to have a nurse with her        there is a nurse here       oh  yes  madame  a very fine one  an excellent one      then  on perceiving her mistress s radiant surprise  her joy at this  relief  she showed herself zealous   madame must not tire herself by  holding the little one  madame hasn t the habit  if madame will allow  me  i will bring the nurse to her      heaving a sigh of happy deliverance  valentine had allowed the servant  to take the child from her  so heaven had not abandoned her  however   she began to discuss the matter  and was not inclined to have the nurse  brought there  she somehow feared that if the other one  who was drunk  in her room  should come out and meet the new arrival  she would set  about beating them all and breaking everything  at last she insisted on  taking santerre and mathieu into the linen room  saying that the  latter must certainly have some knowledge of these matters  although he  declared the contrary  only gaston and lucie were formally forbidden to  follow      you are not wanted   said their mother   so stay here and play  but  we others will all go  and as softly as possible  please  so that that  drunken creature may not suspect anything      once in the linen room  valentine ordered all the doors to be carefully  secured  la couteau was standing there with a sturdy young person of  five and twenty  who carried a superb looking infant in her arms   she had dark hair  a low forehead  and a broad face  and was very  respectably dressed  and she made a little courtesy like a well trained  nurse  who has already served with gentlefolks and knows how to behave   but valentine s embarrassment remained extreme  she looked at the nurse  and at the babe like an ignorant woman who  though her elder children  had been brought up in a room adjoining her own  had never troubled or  concerned herself about anything  in her despair  seeing that santerre  kept to himself  she again appealed to mathieu  who once more excused  himself  and it was only then that la couteau  after glancing askance at  the gentleman who  somehow or other  always turned up whenever she had  business to transact  ventured to intervene      will madame rely on me  if madame will kindly remember  i once before  ventured to offer her my services  and if she had accepted them  she would have saved herself no end of worry  that marie lebleu is  impossible  and i certainly could have warned madame of it at the time  when i came to fetch marie s child  but since madame s doctor had chosen  her  it was not for me to speak  oh  she has good milk  that s quite  sure  only she also has a good tongue  which is always dry  so if madame  will now place confidence in me       then she rattled on interminably  expatiating on the respectability of  her calling  and praising the value of the goods she offered      well  madame  i tell you that you can take la catiche with your eyes  shut  she s exactly what you want  there s no better in paris  just look  how she s built  how sturdy and how healthy she is  and her child  just  look at it  she s married  she even has a little girl of four at the  village with her husband  she s a respectable woman  which is more than  can be said for a good many nurses  in a word  madame  i know her and  can answer for her  if you are not pleased with her i myself will give  you your money back      in her haste to get it all over valentine made a great gesture of  surrender  she even consented to pay one hundred francs a month  since  la catiche was a married woman  moreover  la couteau explained that she  would not have to pay the office charges  which would mean a saving  of forty five francs  though  perhaps  madame would not forget all  the trouble which she  la couteau  had taken  on the other hand  there  would  of course  be the expense of taking la catiche s child back to  the village  a matter of thirty francs  valentine liberally promised to  double that sum  and all seemed to be settled  and she felt delivered   when she suddenly bethought herself of the other nurse  who had  barricaded herself in her room  how could they get her out in order to  install la catiche in her place      what   exclaimed la couteau   does marie lebleu frighten you  she had  better not give me any of her nonsense if she wants me ever to find her  another situation  i ll speak to her  never fear      celeste thereupon placed andree on a blanket  which was lying there   side by side with the infant of which the new nurse had rid herself a  moment previously  and undertook to conduct la couteau to marie lebleu s  room  deathlike silence now reigned there  but the nurse agent only  had to give her name to secure admittance  she went in  and for a few  moments one only heard her dry curt voice  then  on coming out  she  tranquillized valentine  who had gone to listen  trembling      i ve sobered her  i can tell you   said she   pay her her month s  wages  she s packing her box and going off      then  as they went back into the linen room  valentine settled pecuniary  matters and added five francs for this new service  but a final  difficulty arose  la couteau could not come back to fetch la catiche s  child in the evening  and what was she to do with it during the rest  of the day   well  no matter   she said at last   i ll take it  i ll  deposit it at the office  before i go my round  they ll give it a bottle  there  and it ll have to grow accustomed to the bottle now  won t it       of course   the mother quietly replied     then  as la couteau  on the point of leaving  after all sorts of bows  and thanks  turned round to take the little one  she made a gesture of  hesitation on seeing the two children lying side by side on the blanket      the devil   she murmured   i mustn t make a mistake      this seemed amusing  and enlivened the others  celeste fairly exploded   and even la catiche grinned broadly  while la couteau caught up the  child with her long claw like hands and carried it away  yet another  gone  to be carted away yonder in one of those ever recurring  razzias   which consigned the little babes to massacre     mathieu alone had not laughed  he had suddenly recalled his conversation  with boutan respecting the demoralizing effects of that nurse trade  the  shameful bargaining  the common crime of two mothers  who each risked  the death of her child  the idle mother who bought another s services   the venal mother who sold her milk  he felt cold at heart as he saw one  child carried off still full of life  and the other remain there already  so puny  and what would be fate s course  would not one or the other   perhaps both of them be sacrificed     valentine  however  was already leading both him and santerre to the  spacious salon again  and she was so delighted  so fully relieved  that  she had recovered all her cavalier carelessness  her passion for noise  and pleasure  and as mathieu was about to take his leave  he heard the  triumphant santerre saying to her  while for a moment he retained her  hand in his clasp   till to morrow  then   and she  who had cast her  buckler of defence aside  made answer   yes  yes  to morrow      a week later la catiche was the acknowledged queen of the house  andree  had recovered a little color  and was increasing in weight daily  and  in presence of this result the others bowed low indeed  there was every  disposition to overlook all possible faults on the nurse s part  she was  the third  and a fourth would mean the child s death  so that she was  an indispensable  a providential helper  one whose services must be  retained at all costs  moreover  she seemed to have no defects  for  she was a calm  cunning  peasant woman  one who knew how to rule her  employers and extract from them all that was to be extracted  her  conquest of the seguins was effected with extraordinary skill  at first  some unpleasantness seemed likely  because celeste was  on her own side   pursuing a similar course  but they were both too intelligent to do  otherwise than come to an understanding  as their departments were  distinct  they agreed that they could prosecute parallel invasions  and  from that moment they even helped one another  divided the empire  and  preyed upon the house in company     la catiche sat upon a throne  served by the other domestics  with her  employers at her feet  the finest dishes were for her  she had her  special wine  her special bread  she had everything most delicate and  most nourishing that could be found  gluttonous  slothful  and proud   she strutted about  bending one and all to her fancies  the others gave  way to her in everything to avoid sending her into a temper which might  have spoilt her milk  at her slightest indisposition everybody was  distracted  one night she had an attack of indigestion  and all the  doctors in the neighborhood were rung up to attend on her  her only  real defect  perhaps  was a slight inclination for pilfering  she  appropriated some linen that was lying about  but madame would not hear  of the matter being mentioned     there was also the chapter of the presents which were heaped on her in  order to keep her in good temper  apart from the regulation present  when the child cut its first tooth  advantage was taken of various other  occasions  and a ring  a brooch  and a pair of earrings were given her   naturally she was the most adorned nurse in the champs elysees  with  superb cloaks and the richest of caps  trimmed with long ribbons which  flared in the sunlight  never did lady lead a life of more sumptuous  idleness  there were also the presents which she extracted for her  husband and her little girl at the village  parcels were sent them by  express train every week  and on the morning when news came that her  own baby  carried back by la couteau  had died from the effects of a bad  cold  she was presented with fifty francs as if in payment for the loss  of her child  little andree  meanwhile  grew ever stronger  and thus la  catiche rose higher and higher  with the whole house bending low beneath  her tyrannical sway     on the day when mathieu called to sign the deed which was to insure  him the possession of the little pavilion of chantebled with some fifty  acres around it  and the privilege of acquiring other parts of the  estate on certain conditions  he found seguin on the point of starting  for le havre  where a friend  a wealthy englishman  was waiting for him  with his yacht  in order that they might have a month s trip round the  coast of spain      yes   said seguin feverishly  alluding to some recent heavy losses at  the gaming table   i m leaving paris for a time  i have no luck here  just now  but i wish you plenty of courage and all success  my dear sir   you know how much i am interested in the attempt you are about to make      a little later that same day mathieu was crossing the champs elysees   eager to join marianne at chantebled  moved as he was by the decisive  step he had taken  yet quivering also with faith and hope  when in a  deserted avenue he espied a cab waiting  and recognized santerre inside  it  then  as a veiled lady furtively sprang into the vehicle  he turned  round wondering  was that not valentine  and as the cab drove off he  felt convinced it was     there came other meetings when he reached the main avenue  first gaston  and lucie  already tired of play  and dragging about their puny limbs  under the careless supervision of celeste  who was busy laughing with a  grocer s man  while farther off la catiche  superb and royal  decked out  like the idol of venal motherhood  was giving little andree an outing   with her long purple ribbons streaming victoriously in the sunshine           xi    on the day when the first blow with the pick was dealt  marianne  with  gervais in her arms  came and sat down close by  full of happy emotion  at this work of faith and hope which mathieu was so boldly undertaking   it was a clear  warm day in the middle of june  with a pure  broad  sky that encouraged confidence  and as the children had been given a  holiday  they played about in the surrounding grass  and one could hear  the shrill cries of little rose while she amused herself with running  after the three boys      will you deal the first blow   mathieu gayly asked his wife     but she pointed to her baby   no  no  i have my work  deal it yourself   you are the father      he stood there with two men under his orders  but ready himself  to undertake part of the hard manual toil in order to help on the  realization of his long thought of  ripening scheme  with great prudence  and wisdom he had assured himself a modest livelihood for a year of  effort  by an intelligent scheme of association and advances repayable  out of profits  which would enable him to wait for his first harvest   and it was his life that he risked on that future crop  should the earth  refuse his worship and his labor  but he was a faithful believer  one  who felt certain of conquering  since love and determination were his      well then  here goes   he gallantly cried   may the earth prove a good  mother to us      then he dealt the first blow with his pick     the work was begun to the left of the old pavilion  in a corner of that  extensive marshy tableland  where little streams coursed on all sides  through the reeds which sprang up everywhere  it was at first simply a  question of draining a few acres by capturing these streams and turning  them into canals  in order to direct them afterwards over the dry sandy  slopes which descended towards the railway line  after an attentive  examination mathieu had discovered that the work might easily be  executed  and that water furrows would suffice  such was the disposition  and nature of the ground  this  indeed  was his real discovery  not to  mention the layer of humus which he felt certain would be found amassed  on the plateau  and the wondrous fertility which it would display as  soon as a ploughshare had passed through it  and so with his pick he  now began to open the trench which was to drain the damp soil above  and  fertilize the dry  sterile  thirsty ground below     the open air  however  had doubtless given gervais an appetite  for he  began to cry  he was now a strong little fellow  three months and a half  old  and never neglected mealtime  he was growing like one of the young  trees in the neighboring wood  with hands which did not easily release  what they grasped  with eyes too full of light  now all laughter and now  all tears  and with the ever open beak of a greedy bird  that raised a  tempest whenever his mother kept him waiting      yes  yes  i know you are there   said she   come  don t deafen us any  longer      then she gave him the breast and he became quiet  simply purring like a  happy little kitten  the beneficent source had begun to flow once more   as if it were inexhaustible  the trickling milk murmured unceasingly   one might have said that it could be heard descending and spreading   while mathieu on his side continued opening his trench  assisted by the  two men whose apprenticeship was long since past     he rose up at last  wiped his brow  and with his air of quiet certainty  exclaimed   it s only a trade to learn  in a few months  time i shall  be nothing but a peasant  look at that stagnant pond there  green with  water plants  the spring which feeds it is yonder in that big tuft of  herbage  and when this trench has been opened to the edge of the slope   you will see the pond dry up  and the spring gush forth and take its  course  carrying the beneficent water away       ah   said marianne   may it fertilize all that stony expanse  for  nothing can be sadder than dead land  how happy it will be to quench its  thirst and live again      then she broke off to scold gervais   come  young gentleman  don t pull  so hard   said she   wait till it comes  you know very well that it s  all for you      meantime the blows of the pickaxes rang out  the trench rapidly made its  way through the fat  moist soil  and soon the water would flow into  the parched veins of the neighboring sandy tracts to endow them  with fruitfulness  and the light trickling of the mother s milk also  continued with the faint murmur of an inexhaustible source  flowing from  her breast into the mouth of her babe  like a fountain of eternal life   it ever and ever flowed  it created flesh  intelligence  and labor  and  strength  and soon its whispering would mingle with the babble of the  delivered spring as it descended along the trenches to the dry hot  lands  and at last there would be but one and the same stream  one  and the same river  gradually overflowing and carrying life to all the  earth  a mighty river of nourishing milk flowing through the world s  veins  creating without a pause  and producing yet more youth and more  health at each return of springtide     four months later  when mathieu and his men had finished the autumn  ploughing  there came the sowing on the same spot  marianne was there  again  and it was such a very mild gray day that she was still able to  sit down  and once more gayly give the breast to little gervais  he was  already eight months old and had become quite a personage  he grew a  little more every day  always in his mother s arms  on that warm breast  whence he sucked life  he was like the seed which clings to the seed pod  so long as it is not ripe  and at that first quiver of november  that  approach of winter through which the germs would slumber in the furrows   he pressed his chilly little face close to his mother s warm bosom   and nursed on in silence as if the river of life were lost  buried deep  beneath the soil      ah   said marianne  laughing   you are not warm  young gentleman  are  you  it is time for you to take up your winter quarters      just then mathieu  with his sower s bag at his waist  was returning  towards them  scattering the seed with broad rhythmical gestures  he had  heard his wife  and he paused to say to her   let him nurse and sleep  till the sun comes back  he will be a man by harvest time   and   pointing to the great field which he was sowing with his assistants  he  added   all this will grow and ripen when our gervais has begun to walk  and talk  just look  see our conquest      he was proud of it  from ten to fifteen acres of the plateau were now  rid of the stagnant pools  cleared and levelled  and they spread out  in a brown expanse  rich with humus  while the water furrows which  intersected them carried the streams to the neighboring slopes  before  cultivating those dry lands one must yet wait until the moisture should  have penetrated and fertilized them  that would be the work of the  future  and thus  by degrees  life would be diffused through the whole  estate      evening is coming on   resumed mathieu   i must make haste      then he set off again  throwing the seed with his broad rhythmical  gesture  and while marianne  gravely smiling  watched him go  it  occurred to little rose to follow in his track  and take up handfuls of  earth  which she scattered to the wind  the three boys perceived  her  and blaise and denis then hastened up  followed by ambroise  all  gleefully imitating their father s gesture  and darting hither and  thither around him  and for a moment it was almost as if mathieu with  the sweep of his arm not only cast the seed of expected corn into the  furrows  but also sowed those dear children  casting them here and there  without cessation  so that a whole nation of little sowers should spring  up and finish populating the world     two months more went by  and january had arrived with a hard frost   when one day the froments unexpectedly received a visit from seguin and  beauchene  who had come to try their luck at wild duck shooting  among  such of the ponds on the plateau as had not yet been drained  it was a  sunday  and the whole family was gathered in the roomy kitchen  cheered  by a big fire  through the clear windows one could see the far spreading  countryside  white with rime  and stiffly slumbering under that crystal  casing  like some venerated saint awaiting april s resurrection  and   that day  when the visitors presented themselves  gervais also was  slumbering in his white cradle  rendered somnolent by the season  but  plump even as larks are in the cold weather  and waiting  he also   simply for life s revival  in order to reappear in all the triumph of  his acquired strength     the family had gayly partaken of dejeuner  and now  before nightfall   the four children had gathered round a table by the window  absorbed  in a playful occupation which delighted them  helped by ambroise  the  twins  blaise and denis  were building a whole village out of pieces of  cardboard  fixed together with paste  there were houses  a town hall   a church  a school  and rose  who had been forbidden to touch the  scissors  presided over the paste  with which she smeared herself even  to her hair  in the deep quietude  through which their laughter rang at  intervals  their father and mother had remained seated side by side in  front of the blazing fire  enjoying that delightful sunday peace after  the week s hard work     they lived there very simply  like genuine peasants  without any luxury   any amusement  save that of being together  their gay  bright kitchen  was redolent of that easy primitive life  lived so near the earth  which  frees one from fictitious wants  ambition  and the longing for pleasure   and no fortune  no power could have brought such quiet delight as that  afternoon of happy intimacy  while the last born slept so soundly and  quietly that one could not even hear him breathe     beauchene and seguin broke in upon the quiet like unlucky sportsmen   with their limbs weary and their faces and hands icy cold  amid the  exclamations of surprise which greeted them  they complained of the  folly that had possessed them to venture out of paris in such bleak  weather      just fancy  my dear fellow   said beauchene   we haven t seen a single  duck  it s no doubt too cold  and you can t imagine what a bitter  wind blows on the plateau  amid those ponds and bushes bristling with  icicles  so we gave up the idea of any shooting  you must give us each a  glass of hot wine  and then we ll get back to paris      seguin  who was in even a worse humor  stood before the fire trying to  thaw himself  and while marianne made haste to warm some wine  he began  to speak of the cleared fields which he had skirted  under the icy  covering  however  beneath which they stiffly slumbered  hiding the  seed within them  he had guessed nothing of the truth  and already felt  anxious about this business of mathieu s  which looked anything but  encouraging  indeed  he already feared that he would not be paid his  purchase money  and so made bold to speak ironically      i say  my dear fellow  i am afraid you have lost your time   he began    i noticed it all as i went by  and it did not seem promising  but how  can you hope to reap anything from rotten soil in which only reeds have  been growing for centuries       one must wait   mathieu quietly answered   you must come back and see  it all next june      but beauchene interrupted them   there is a train at four o clock  i  think   said he   let us make haste  for it would annoy us tremendously  to miss it  would it not  seguin      so saying  he gave him a gay  meaning glance  they had doubtless planned  some little spree together  like husbands bent on availing themselves to  the utmost of the convenient pretext of a day s shooting  then  having  drunk some wine and feeling warmed and livelier  they began to express  astonishment at their surroundings      it stupefies me  my dear fellow   declared beauchene   that you can  live in this awful solitude in the depth of winter  it is enough to kill  anybody  i am all in favor of work  you know  but  dash it  one must  have some amusement too       but we do amuse ourselves   said mathieu  waving his hand round that  rustic kitchen in which centred all their pleasant family life     the two visitors followed his gesture  and gazed in amazement at the  walls covered with utensils  at the rough furniture  and at the table  on which the children were still building their village after offering  their cheeks to be kissed  no doubt they were unable to understand  what pleasure there could possibly be there  for  suppressing a jeering  laugh  they shook their heads  to them it was really an extraordinary  life  a life of most singular taste      come and see my little gervais   said marianne softly   he is asleep   mind  you must not wake him      for politeness  sake they both bent over the cradle  and expressed  surprise at finding a child but ten months old so big  he was very  good  too  only  as soon as he should wake  he would no doubt deafen  everybody  and then  too  if a fine child like that sufficed to make  life happy  how many people must be guilty of spoiling their lives  the  visitors came back to the fireside  anxious only to be gone now that  they felt enlivened      so it s understood   said mathieu   you won t stay to dinner with us       oh  no  indeed   they exclaimed in one breath     then  to attenuate the discourtesy of such a cry  beauchene began to  jest  and accepted the invitation for a later date when the warm weather  should have arrived      on my word of honor  we have business in paris   he declared   but  i promise you that when it s fine we will all come and spend a day  here  yes  with our wives and children  and you will then show us your  work  and we shall see if you have succeeded  so good by  all my good  wishes  my dear fellow  au revoir  cousin  au revoir  children  be  good      then came more kisses and hand shakes  and the two men disappeared  and  when the gentle silence had fallen once more mathieu and marianne  again found themselves in front of the bright fire  while the children  completed the building of their village with a great consumption of  paste  and gervais continued sleeping soundly  had they been dreaming   mathieu wondered  what sudden blast from all the shame and suffering of  paris had blown into their far away quiet  outside  the country retained  its icy rigidity  the fire alone sang the song of hope in life s future  revival  and  all at once  after a few minutes  reverie the young man  began to speak aloud  as if he had at last just found the answer to all  sorts of grave questions which he had long since put to himself      but those folks don t love  they are incapable of loving  money  power   ambition  pleasure  yes  all those things may be theirs  but not love   even the husbands who deceive their wives do not really love their  mistresses  they have never glowed with the supreme desire  the divine  desire which is the world s very soul  the brazier of eternal life  and  that explains everything  without desire there is no love  no courage   and no hope  by love alone can one create  and if love be restricted  in its mission there is but failure  yes  they lie and deceive  because  they do not love  then they suffer and lapse into moral and physical  degradation  and at the end lies the collapse of our rotten society   which breaks up more and more each day before our eyes  that  then  is  the truth i was seeking  it is desire and love that save  whoever loves  and creates is the revolutionary saviour  the maker of men for the new  world which will shortly dawn      never before had mathieu so plainly understood that he and his wife were  different from others  this now struck him with extraordinary force   comparisons ensued  and he realized that their simple life  free from  the lust of wealth  their contempt for luxury and worldly vanities  all  their common participation in toil which made them accept and glorify  life and its duties  all that mode of existence of theirs which was  at once their joy and their strength  sprang solely from the source of  eternal energy  the love with which they glowed  if  later on  victory  should remain with them  if they should some day leave behind them work  of value and health and happiness  it would be solely because they had  possessed the power of love and the courage to love freely  harvesting   in an ever increasing family  both the means of support and the means  of conquest  and this sudden conviction filled mathieu with such a glow  that he leant towards his wife  who sat there deeply moved by what he  said  and kissed her ardently upon the lips  it was divine love passing  like a flaming blast  but she  though her own eyes were sparkling   laughingly scolded him  saying   hush  hush  you will wake gervais      then they remained there hand in hand  pressing each other s fingers  amid the silence  evening was coming on  and at last the children  their  village finished  raised cries of rapture at seeing it standing there  among bits of wood  which figured trees  and then the softened glances  of the parents strayed now through the window towards the crops sleeping  beneath the crystalline rime  and now towards their last born s cradle   where hope was likewise slumbering     again did two long months go by  gervais had just completed his first  year  and fine weather  setting in early  was hastening the awaking  of the earth  one morning  when marianne and the children went to join  mathieu on the plateau  they raised shouts of wonder  so completely had  the sun transformed the expanse in a single week  it was now all green  velvet  a thick endless carpet of sprouting corn  of tender  delicate  emerald hue  never had such a marvellous crop been seen  and thus  as  the family walked on through the mild  radiant april morning  amid the  country now roused from winter s sleep  and quivering with fresh  youth  they all waxed merry at the sight of that healthfulness  that  progressing fruitfulness  which promised the fulfilment of all their  hopes  and their rapture yet increased when  all at once  they noticed  that little gervais also was awaking to life  acquiring decisive  strength  as he struggled in his little carriage and his mother removed  him from it  behold  he took his flight  and  staggering  made four  steps  then hung to his father s legs with his little fists  a cry of  extraordinary delight burst forth      why  he walks  he walks      ah  those first lispings of life  those successive flights of the dear  little ones  the first glance  the first smile  the first step  what joy  do they not bring to parents  hearts  they are the rapturous  etapes   of infancy  for which father and mother watch  which they await  impatiently  which they hail with exclamations of victory  as if each  were a conquest  a fresh triumphal entry into life  the child grows  the  child becomes a man  and there is yet the first tooth  forcing its  way like a needle point through rosy gums  and there is also the first  stammered word  the  pa pa   the  mam ma   which one is quite ready  to detect amid the vaguest babble  though it be but the purring of a  kitten  the chirping of a bird  life does its work  and the father and  the mother are ever wonderstruck with admiration and emotion at the  sight of that efflorescence alike of their flesh and their souls      wait a moment   said marianne   he will come back to me  gervais   gervais      and after a little hesitation  a false start  the child did indeed  return  taking the four steps afresh  with arms extended and beating the  air as if they were balancing poles      gervais  gervais   called mathieu in his turn  and the child went back  to him  and again and again did they want him to repeat the journey   amid their mirthful cries  so pretty and so funny did they find him     then  seeing that the four other children began playing rather roughly  with him in their enthusiasm  marianne carried him away  and once more   on the same spot  on the young grass  did she give him the breast  and  again did the stream of milk trickle forth     close by that spot  skirting the new field  there passed a crossroad  in  rather bad condition  leading to a neighboring village  and on this road  a cart suddenly came into sight  jolting amid the ruts  and driven by  a peasant  who was so absorbed in his contemplation of the land which  mathieu had cleared  that he would have let his horse climb upon a heap  of stones had not a woman who accompanied him abruptly pulled the reins   the horse then stopped  and the man in a jeering voice called out   so  this  then  is your work  monsieur froment      mathieu and marianne thereupon recognized the lepailleurs  the people of  the mill  they were well aware that folks laughed at janville over the  folly of their attempt  that mad idea of growing wheat among the marshes  of the plateau  lepailleur  in particular  distinguished himself by the  violent raillery he levelled at this parisian  a gentleman born  with  a good berth  who was so stupid as to make himself a peasant  and fling  what money he had to that rascally earth  which would assuredly swallow  him and his children and his money all together  without yielding even  enough wheat to keep them in bread  and thus the sight of the field had  stupefied him  it was a long while since he had passed that way  and  he had never thought that the seed would sprout so thickly  for he had  repeated a hundred times that nothing would germinate  so rotten was  all the land  although he almost choked with covert anger at seeing his  predictions thus falsified  he was unwilling to admit his error  and put  on an air of ironical doubt      so you think it will grow  eh  well  one can t say that it hasn t come  up  only one must see if it can stand and ripen   and as mathieu quietly  smiled with hope and confidence  he added  striving to poison his joy    ah  when you know the earth you ll find what a hussy she is  i ve seen  plenty of crops coming on magnificently  and then a storm  a gust of  wind  a mere trifle  has reduced them to nothing  but you are young at  the trade as yet  you ll get your experience in misfortune      his wife  who nodded approval on hearing him talk so finely  then  addressed herself to marianne   oh  my man doesn t say that to  discourage you  madame  but the land you know  is just like children   there are some who live and some who die  some who give one pleasure   and others who kill one with grief  but  all considered  one always  bestows more on them than one gets back  and in the end one finds  oneself duped  you ll see  you ll see      without replying  marianne  moved by these malicious predictions   gently raised her trustful eyes to mathieu  and he  though for a moment  irritated by all the ignorance  envy  and imbecile ambition which he  felt were before him  contented himself with jesting   that s it  we ll  see  when your son antoine becomes a prefect  and i have twelve peasant  daughters ready  i ll invite you to their weddings  for it s your mill  that ought to be rebuilt  you know  and provided with a fine engine   so as to grind all the corn of my property yonder  left and right   everywhere      the sweep of his arm embraced such a far expanse of ground that the  miller  who did not like to be derided  almost lost his temper  he  lashed his horse with his whip  and the cart jolted on again through the  ruts      wheat in the ear is not wheat in the mill   said he   au revoir  and  good luck to you  all the same       thanks  au revoir      then  while the children still ran about  seeking early primroses among  the mosses  mathieu came and sat down beside marianne  who  he saw   was quivering  he said nothing to her  for he knew that she possessed  sufficient strength and confidence to surmount  unaided  such fears for  the future as threats might kindle in her womanly heart  but he simply  set himself there  so near her that he touched her  looking and smiling  at her the while  and she immediately became calm again and likewise  smiled  while little gervais  whom the words of the malicious could not  as yet disturb  nursed more eagerly than ever  with a purr of rapturous  satisfaction  the milk was ever trickling  bringing flesh to little  limbs which grew stronger day by day  spreading through the earth   filling the whole world  nourishing the life which increased hour by  hour  and was not this the answer which faith and hope returned to all  threats of death   the certainty of life s victory  with fine children  ever growing in the sunlight  and fine crops ever rising from the soil  at each returning spring  to morrow  yet once again  on the glorious day  of harvest  the corn will have ripened  the children will be men     and it was thus  indeed  three months later  when the beauchenes and the  seguins  keeping their promise  came  husbands  wives  and children  to  spend a sunday afternoon at chantebled  the froments had even prevailed  on morange to be of the party with reine  in their desire to draw him  for a day  at any rate  from the dolorous prostration in which he lived   as soon as all these fine folks had alighted from the train it was  decided to go up to the plateau to see the famous fields  for everybody  was curious about them  so extravagant and inexplicable did the idea of  mathieu s return to the soil  and transformation into a peasant  seem  to them  he laughed gayly  and at least he succeeded in surprising them  when he waved his hand towards the great expanse under the broad blue  sky  that sea of tall green stalks whose ears were already heavy and  undulated at the faintest breeze  that warm splendid afternoon  the  far spreading fields looked like the very triumph of fruitfulness  a  growth of germs which the humus amassed through centuries had nourished  with prodigious sap  thus producing this first formidable crop  as if to  glorify the eternal source of life which sleeps in the earth s  flanks  the milk had streamed  and the corn now grew on all sides with  overflowing energy  creating health and strength  bespeaking man s  labor and the kindliness  the solidarity of the world  it was like a  beneficent  nourishing ocean  in which all hunger would be appeased  and  in which to morrow might arise  amid that tide of wheat whose waves were  ever carrying good news to the horizon     true  neither constance nor valentine was greatly touched by the  sight of the waving wheat  for other ambitions filled their minds  and  morange  though he stared with his vague dim eyes  did not even seem to  see it  but beauchene and seguin marvelled  for they remembered their  visit in the month of january  when the frozen ground had been wrapt  in sleep and mystery  they had then guessed nothing  and now they were  amazed at this miraculous awakening  this conquering fertility  which  had changed a part of the marshy tableland into a field of living  wealth  and seguin  in particular  did not cease praising and admiring   certain as he now felt that he would be paid  and already hoping that  mathieu would soon take a further portion of the estate off his hands     then  as soon as they had walked to the old pavilion  now transformed  into a little farm  and had seated themselves in the garden  pending  dinner time  the conversation fell upon children  marianne  as it  happened  had weaned gervais the day before  and he was there among the  ladies  still somewhat unsteady on his legs  and yet boldly going from  one to the other  careless of his frequent falls on his back or his  nose  he was a gay spirited child who seldom lost his temper  doubtless  because his health was so good  his big clear eyes were ever laughing   he offered his little hands in a friendly way  and was very white  very  pink  and very sturdy  quite a little man indeed  though but fifteen and  a half months old  constance and valentine admired him  while marianne  jested and turned him away each time that he greedily put out his little  hands towards her      no  no  monsieur  it s over now  you will have nothing but soup in  future       weaning is such a terrible business   then remarked constance   did he  let you sleep last night       oh  yes  he had good habits  you know  he never troubled me at night   but this morning he was stupefied and began to cry  still  you see  he  is fairly well behaved already  besides  i never had more trouble than  this with the other ones      beauchene was standing there  listening  and  as usual  smoking a cigar   constance appealed to him      you are lucky  but you  dear  remember  don t you   what a life maurice  led us when his nurse went away  for three whole nights we were unable  to sleep       but just look how your maurice is playing   exclaimed beauchene   yet  you ll be telling me again that he is ill       oh  i no longer say that  my friend  he is quite well now  besides  i  was never anxious  i know that he is very strong      a great game of hide and seek was going on in the garden  along the  paths and even over the flower beds  among the eight children who were  assembled there  besides the four of the house  blaise  denis  ambroise   and rose  there were gaston and lucie  the two elder children of  the seguins  who had abstained  however  from bringing their other  daughter  little andree  then  too  both reine and maurice were present   and the latter now  indeed  seemed to be all right upon his legs  though  his square face with its heavy jaw still remained somewhat pale  his  mother watched him running about  and felt so happy and so vain at the  realization of her dream that she became quite amiable even towards  these poor relatives the froments  whose retirement into the country  seemed to her like an incomprehensible downfall  which forever thrust  them out of her social sphere      ah  well   resumed beauchene   i ve only one boy  but he s a sturdy  fellow  i warrant it  isn t he  mathieu      these words had scarcely passed his lips when he must have regretted  them  his eyelids quivered and a little chill came over him as his  glance met that of his former designer  for in the latter s clear eyes  he beheld  as it were  a vision of that other son  norine s ill fated  child  who had been cast into the unknown  then there came a pause  and  amid the shrill cries of the boys and girls playing at hide and seek  a number of little shadows flitted through the sunlight  they were the  shadows of the poor doomed babes who scarce saw the light before they  were carried off from homes and hospitals to be abandoned in corners   and die of cold  and perhaps even of starvation     mathieu had been unable to answer a word  and his emotion increased  when he noticed morange huddled up on a chair  and gazing with blurred   tearful eyes at little gervais  who was laughingly toddling hither and  thither  had a vision come to him also  had the phantom of his dead  wife  shrinking from the duties of motherhood and murdered in a hateful  den  risen before him in that sunlit garden  amid all the turbulent  mirth of happy  playful children      what a pretty girl your daughter reine is   said mathieu  in the hope  of drawing the accountant from his haunting remorse   just look at her  running about   so girlish still  as if she were not almost old enough  to be married      morange slowly raised his head and looked at his daughter  and a smile  returned to his eyes  still moist with tears  day by day his adoration  increased  as reine grew up he found her more and more like her mother   and all his thoughts became centred in her  his one yearning was that  she might be very beautiful  very happy  very rich  that would be a sign  that he was forgiven  that would be the only joy for which he could  yet hope  and amid it all there was a vague feeling of jealousy at the  thought that a husband would some day take her from him  and that he  would remain alone in utter solitude  alone with the phantom of his dead  wife      married   he murmured   oh  not yet  she is only fourteen      at this the others expressed surprise  they would have taken her to be  quite eighteen  so womanly was her precocious beauty already      as a matter of fact   resumed her father  feeling flattered   she has  already been asked in marriage  you know that the baroness de lowicz  is kind enough to take her out now and then  well  she told me that an  arch millionnaire had fallen in love with reine  but he ll have to wait   i shall still be able to keep her to myself for another five or six  years at least      he no longer wept  but gave a little laugh of egotistical satisfaction   without noticing the chill occasioned by the mention of seraphine s  name  for even beauchene felt that his sister was hardly a fit companion  for a young girl     then marianne  anxious at seeing the conversation drop  began   questioning valentine  while gervais at last slyly crept to her knees      why did you not bring your little andree   she inquired   i should have  been so pleased to kiss her  and she would have been able to play  with this little gentleman  who  you see  does not leave me a moment s  peace      but seguin did not give his wife time to reply   ah  no  indeed   he  exclaimed   in that case i should not have come  it is quite enough to  have to drag the two others about  that fearful child has not ceased  deafening us ever since her nurse went away      valentine then explained that andree was not really well behaved  she  had been weaned at the beginning of the previous week  and la catiche   after terrorizing the household for more than a year  had plunged it  by her departure into anarchy  ah  that catiche  she might compliment  herself on all the money she had cost  sent away almost by force  like  a queen who is bound to abdicate at last  she had been loaded with  presents for herself and her husband  and her little girl at the  village  and now it had been of little use to take a dry nurse in her  place  for andree did not cease shrieking from morning till night  they  had discovered  too  that la catiche had not only carried off with her  a large quantity of linen  but had left the other servants quite spoilt   disorganized  so that a general clearance seemed necessary      oh   resumed marianne  as if to smooth things   when the children are  well one can overlook other worries       why  do you imagine that andree is well   cried seguin  giving way to  one of his brutal fits   that catiche certainly set her right at first   but i don t know what happened afterwards  for now she is simply skin  and bones   then  as his wife wished to protest  he lost his temper    do you mean to say that i don t speak the truth  why  look at our two  others yonder  they have papier mache faces  too  it is evident that you  don t look after them enough  you know what a poor opinion santerre has  of them      for him santerre s opinion remained authoritative  however  valentine  contented herself with shrugging her shoulders  while the others   feeling slightly embarrassed  looked at gaston and lucie  who amid the  romping of their companions  soon lost breath and lagged behind  sulky  and distrustful      but  my dear friend   said constance to valentine   didn t our good  doctor boutan tell you that all the trouble came from your not nursing  your children yourself  at all events  that was the compliment that he  paid me      at the mention of boutan a friendly shout arose  oh  boutan  boutan  he  was like all other specialists  seguin sneered  beauchene jested about  the legislature decreeing compulsory nursing by mothers  and only  mathieu and marianne remained silent      of course  my dear friend  we are not jesting about you   said  constance  turning towards the latter   your children are superb  and  nobody says the contrary      marianne gayly waved her hand  as if to reply that they were free to  make fun of her if they pleased  but at this moment she perceived that  gervais  profiting by her inattention  was busy seeking his  paradise  lost   and thereupon she set him on the ground   ah  no  no  monsieur    she exclaimed   i have told you that it is all over  can t you see that  people would laugh at us      then for her and her husband came a delightful moment  he was looking at  her with deep emotion  her duty accomplished  she was now returning to  him  for she was spouse as well as mother  never had he thought her so  beautiful  possessed of so strong and so calm a beauty  radiant with  the triumph of happy motherhood  as though indeed a spark of something  divine had been imparted to her by that river of milk that had streamed  from her bosom  a song of glory seemed to sound  glory to the source of  life  glory to the true mother  to the one who nourishes  her travail  o er  for there is none other  the rest are imperfect and cowardly   responsible for incalculable disasters  and on seeing her thus  in  that glory  amid her vigorous children  like the good goddess of  fruitfulness  mathieu felt that he adored her  divine passion swept  by  the glow which makes the fields palpitate  which rolls on through  the waters  and floats in the wind  begetting millions and millions of  existences  and  twas delightful the ecstasy into which they both sank   forgetfulness of all else  of all those others who were there  they saw  them no longer  they felt but one desire  to say that they loved each  other  and that the season had come when love blossoms afresh  his lips  protruded  she offered hers  and then they kissed      oh  don t disturb yourselves   cried beauchene merrily   why  what is  the matter with you       would you like us to move away   added seguin     but while valentine laughed wildly  and constance put on a prudish air   morange  in whose voice tears were again rising  spoke these words   fraught with supreme regret   ah  you are right      astonished at what they had done  without intention of doing it  mathieu  and marianne remained for a moment speechless  looking at one another in  consternation  and then they burst into a hearty laugh  gayly excusing  themselves  to love  to love  to be able to love  therein lies all  health  all will  and all power           xii    four years went by  and during those four years mathieu and marianne had  two more children  a daughter at the end of the first year and a son  at the expiration of the third  and each time that the family thus  increased  the estate at chantebled was increased also  on the first  occasion by fifty more acres of rich soil reclaimed among the marshes  of the plateau  and the second time by an extensive expanse of wood  and moorland which the springs were beginning to fertilize  it was  the resistless conquest of life  it was fruitfulness spreading in the  sunlight  it was labor ever incessantly pursuing its work of creation  amid obstacles and suffering  making good all losses  and at each  succeeding hour setting more energy  more health  and more joy in the  veins of the world     on the day when mathieu called on seguin to purchase the wood and  moorland  he lunched with dr  boutan  whom he found in an execrable  humor  the doctor had just heard that three of his former patients had  lately passed through the hands of his colleague gaude  the notorious  surgeon to whose clinic at the marbeuf hospital society paris flocked as  to a theatre  one of these patients was none other than euphrasie  old  moineaud s eldest daughter  now married to auguste benard  a mason   and already the mother of three children  she had doubtless resumed her  usual avocations too soon after the birth of her last child  as often  happens in working class families where the mother is unable to remain  idle  at all events  she had for some time been ailing  and had finally  been removed to the hospital  mathieu had for a while employed her young  sister cecile  now seventeen  as a servant in the house at chantebled   but she was of poor health and had returned to paris  where  curiously  enough  she also entered doctor gaude s clinic  and boutan waxed  indignant at the methods which gaude employed  the two sisters  the  married woman and the girl  had been discharged as cured  and so far   this might seem to be the case  but time  in boutan s opinion  would  bring round some terrible revenges     one curious point of the affair was that beauchene s dissolute sister   seraphine  having heard of these so called cures  which the newspapers  had widely extolled  had actually sought out the benards and the  moineauds to interview euphrasie and cecile on the subject  and in the  result she likewise had placed herself in gaude s hands  she certainly  was of little account  and  whatever might become of her  the world  would be none the poorer by her death  but boutan pointed out that  during the fifteen years that gaude s theories and practices had  prevailed in france  no fewer than half a million women had been treated  accordingly  and  in the vast majority of cases  without any such  treatment being really necessary  moreover  boutan spoke feelingly of  the after results of such treatment  comparative health for a few brief  years  followed in some cases by a total loss of muscular energy  and in  others by insanity of a most violent form  so that the padded cells of  the madhouses were filling year by year with the unhappy women who had  passed through the hands of gaude and his colleagues  from a social  point of view also the effects were disastrous  they ran counter to all  boutan s own theories  and blasted all his hopes of living to see france  again holding a foremost place among the nations of the earth      ah   said he to mathieu   if people were only like you and your good  wife      during those four years at chantebled the froments had been ever  founding  creating  increasing  and multiplying  again and again proving  victorious in the eternal battle which life wages against death  thanks  to that continual increase both of offspring and of fertile land which  was like their very existence  their joy and their strength  desire  passed like a gust of flame  desire divine and fruitful  since they  possessed the power of love  kindliness  and health  and their energy  did the rest  that will of action  that quiet bravery in the presence of  the labor that is necessary  the labor that has made and that regulates  the earth  but during the first two years they had to struggle  incessantly  there were two disastrous winters with snow and ice  and  march brought hail storms and hurricanes which left the crops lying low   even as lepailleur had threateningly predicted with a laugh of impotent  envy  it seemed as if the earth meant to prove a bad mother  ungrateful  to them for their toil  indifferent to their losses  during those two  years they only extricated themselves from trouble thanks to the second  fifty acres that they purchased from seguin  to the west of the plateau   a fresh expanse of rich soil which they reclaimed amid the marshes  and  which  in spite of frost and hail  yielded a prodigious first harvest   as the estate gradually expanded  it also grew stronger  better able to  bear ill luck     but mathieu and marianne also had great family worries  their five elder  children gave them much anxiety  much fatigue  as with the soil  here  again there was a daily battle  endless cares and endless fears  little  gervais was stricken with fever and narrowly escaped death  rose  too   one day filled them with the direst alarm  for she fell from a tree in  their presence  but fortunately with no worse injury than a sprain  and   on the other hand  they were happy in the three others  blaise  denis   and ambroise  who proved as healthy as young oak trees  and when  marianne gave birth to her sixth child  on whom they bestowed the gay  name of claire  mathieu celebrated the new pledge of their affection by  further acquisitions     then  during the two ensuing years  their battles and sadness and joy  all resulted in victory once more  marianne gave birth  and mathieu  conquered new lands  there was ever much labor  much life expended   and much life realized and harvested  this time it was a question of  enlarging the estate on the side of the moorlands  the sandy  gravelly  slopes where nothing had grown for centuries  the captured sources of  the tableland  directed towards those uncultivated tracts  gradually  fertilized them  covered them with increasing vegetation  there were  partial failures at first  and defeat even seemed possible  so great was  the patient determination which the creative effort demanded  but here   too  the crops at last overflowed  while the intelligent felling of a  part of the purchased woods resulted in a large profit  and gave mathieu  an idea of cultivating some of the spacious clearings hitherto overgrown  with brambles     and while the estate spread the children grew  it had been necessary to  send the three elder ones  blaise  denis  and ambroise  to a school  in paris  whither they gallantly repaired each day by the first train   returning only in the evening  but the three others  little gervais and  the girls rose and claire  were still allowed all freedom in the midst  of nature  marianne  however  gave birth to a seventh child  amid  circumstances which caused mathieu keen anxiety  for a moment  indeed   he feared that he might lose her  but her healthful temperament  triumphed over all  and the child  a boy  named gregoire  soon drank  life and strength from her breast  as from the very source of existence   when mathieu saw his wife smiling again with that dear little one in her  arms  he embraced her passionately  and triumphed once again over every  sorrow and every pang  yet another child  yet more wealth and power   yet an additional force born into the world  another field ready for  to morrow s harvest     and  twas ever the great work  the good work  the work of fruitfulness  spreading  thanks to the earth and to woman  both victorious over  destruction  offering fresh means of subsistence each time a fresh child  was born  and loving  willing  battling  toiling even amid suffering   and ever tending to increase of life and increase of hope                           then two more years rolled on  and during those two years mathieu and  marianne had yet another child  a girl  and again  at the same time as  the family increased  the estate of chantebled was increased also  on  one side by five and seventy acres of woodland stretching over  the plateau as far as the fields of mareuil  and on the other by  five and seventy acres of sloping moorland  extending to the village of  monval  alongside the railway line  but the principal change was that   as the old hunting box  the little dilapidated pavilion  no longer  offered sufficient accommodation  a whole farmstead had to be  erected  stone buildings  and barns  and sheds  and stables  and  cowhouses  for farm hands and crops and animals  whose number increased  at each enlargement of the estate     it was the resistless conquest of life  it was fruitfulness spreading  in the sunlight  it was labor ever incessantly pursuing its work of  creation amid obstacles and suffering  ever making good all losses  and  at each succeeding hour setting more energy  more health  and more joy  in the veins of the world     but during those two years  while chantebled grew  while labor and worry  and victory alternated  mathieu suddenly found himself mixed up in a  terribly tragedy  he was obliged to come to paris at times  more often  indeed than he cared  now through his business relations with seguin   now to sell  now to buy  now to order one thing or another  he often  purchased implements and appliances at the beauchene works  and had thus  kept up intercourse with morange  who once more seemed a changed man   time had largely healed the wound left by his wife s death  particularly  as she seemed to live again in reine  to whom he was more attached than  ever  reine was no longer a child  she had become a woman  still her  father hoped to keep her with him some years yet  while working with all  diligence  saving and saving every penny that he could spare  in order  to increase her dowry     but the inevitable was on the march  for the girl had become the  constant companion of seraphine  the latter  however depraved she  might be  had certainly in the first instance entertained no idea of  corrupting the child whom she patronized  she had at first taken  her solely to such places of amusement as were fit for her years and  understanding  but little by little the descent had come  reine  too   as she grew into a woman  amid the hours of idleness when she was  left alone by her father  who  perforce  had to spend his days at the  beauchene works  developed an ardent temperament and a thirst for every  frivolous pleasure  and by degrees the once simply petted child became a  participator in seraphine s own reckless and dissolute life     when the end came  and reine found herself in dire trouble because of  a high state functionary  a married man  a friend of seraphine s  both  women quite lost their heads  such a blow might kill morange  everything  must be hidden from him  but how  thereupon seraphine devised a plan   she obtained permission for reine to accompany her on a visit into  the country  but while the fond father imagined that his daughter was  enjoying herself among society folk at a chateau in the loiret  she  was really hiding in paris  it was indeed a repetition of her mother s  tragic story  with this difference  that seraphine addressed herself to  no vulgar madame rouche  but to an assistant of her own surgeon  gaude   a certain sarraille  who had a dingy den of a clinic in the passage  tivoli     it was a bright day in august  and mathieu  who had come to paris to  make some purchases at the beauchene works  was lunching alone with  morange at the latter s flat  when seraphine arrived there breathless  and in consternation  reine  she said  had been taken ill in the  country  and she had brought her back to paris to her own flat  but it  was not thither  it was to sarraille s den that she drove morange and  mathieu  and there the frightful scene which had been enacted at la  rouche s at the time of valerie s death was repeated  reine  too  was  dead  dead like her mother  and morange  in a first outburst of fury  threatened both seraphine and sarraille with the scaffold  for half an  hour there was no mastering him  but all at once he broke down  to lose  his daughter as he had lost his wife  it was too appalling  the blow  was too great  he had strength left only to weep  sarraille  moreover   defended himself  he swore that he had known nothing of the truth  that  the deceased had simply come to him for legitimate treatment  and that  both she and the baroness had deceived him  then seraphine on her side  took hold of morange s hands  protesting her devotion  her frightful  grief  her fear  too  lest the reputation of the poor dear girl should  be dragged through the mire  if he  the father  did not keep the  terrible secret  she accepted her share of responsibility and blame   admitted that she had been very culpable  and spoke of eternal remorse   but might the terrible truth be buried in the dead girl s grave  might  there be none but pure flowers strewn upon that grave  might she who lay  therein be regretted by all who had known her  as one snatched away in  all innocence of youth and beauty     and morange yielded to his weakness of heart  stifling the while with  sobs  and scarce repeating that word  murderers   which had sprung from  his lips so impulsively a little while before  he thought  too  of  the scandal  an autopsy  a court of law  the newspapers recounting the  crime  his daughter s memory covered with mire  and  no  no  he could  have none of that  whatever seraphine might be  she had spoken rightly     then his powerlessness to avenge his daughter completed his prostration   it was as if he had been beaten almost to the point of death  every  one of his limbs was bruised  his head seemed empty  his heart cold  and scarce able to beat  and he sank into a sort of second childhood   clasping his hands and stammering plaintively  terrified  and beseeching  compassion  like one whose sufferings are too hard to bear     and when mathieu sought to console him he muttered   oh  it is all over   they have both gone  one after the other  and i alone am guilty  the  first time it was i who lied to reine  telling her that her mother was  travelling  and then she in her turn lied to me the other day with that  story of an invitation to a chateau in the country  ah  if eight years  ago i had only opposed my poor valerie s madness  my poor reine would  still be alive to day     yes  it is all my fault  i alone killed them  by my weakness  i am their murderer      shivering  deathly cold  he went on amid his sobs   and  wretched fool  that i have been  i have killed them through loving them too much  they  were so beautiful  and it was so excusable for them to be rich and gay  and happy  one after the other they took my heart from me  and i lived  only in them and by them and for them  when one had left me  the other  became my all in all  and for her  my daughter  i again indulged in the  dream of ambition which had originated with her mother  and yet i killed  them both  and my mad desire to rise and conquer fortune led me to that  twofold crime  ah  when i think that even this morning i still dared  to esteem myself happy at having but that one child  that daughter to  cherish  what foolish blasphemy against love and life  she is dead now   dead like her mother  and i am alone  with nobody to love and nobody  to love me  neither wife nor daughter  neither desire nor will  but  alone  ah  all alone  forever      it was the cry of supreme abandonment that he raised  while sinking to  the floor strengthless  with a great void within him  and all he could  do was to press mathieu s hands and stammer   leave me  tell me nothing   you alone were right  i refused the offers of life  and life has now  taken everything from me      mathieu  in tears himself  kissed him and lingered yet a few moments  longer in that tragic den  feeling more moved than he had ever felt  before  and when he went off he left the unhappy morange in the charge  of seraphine  who now treated him like a little ailing child whose  will power was entirely gone     and at chantebled  as time went on  mathieu and marianne founded   created  increased  and multiplied  during the two years which elapsed   they again proved victorious in the eternal battle which life wages  against death  thanks to that continual increase both of offspring and  of fertile land which was like their very existence  their joy  and  their strength  desire passed like a gust of flame  desire divine  and fruitful  since they possessed the power of love  kindliness  and  health  and their energy did the rest  that will of action  that quiet  bravery in the presence of the labor that is necessary  the labor that  has made and that regulates the world  they were  however  still in the  hard  trying  earlier stage of their work of conquest  and they often  wept with grief and anxiety  many were their cares  too  in transforming  the old pavilion into a farm  the outlay was considerable  and at  times it seemed as if the crops would never pay the building accounts   moreover  as the enterprise grew in magnitude  and there came more and  more cattle  more and more horses  a larger staff of both men and  girls became necessary  to say nothing of additional implements and  appliances  and the increase of supervision which left the froments  little rest  mathieu controlled the agricultural part of the enterprise   ever seeking improved methods for drawing from the earth all the life  that slumbered within it  and marianne watched over the farmyard  the  dairy  the poultry  and showed herself a first class accountant   keeping the books  and receiving and paying money  and thus  in spite of  recurring worries  strokes of bad luck and inevitable mistakes  fortune  smiled on them athwart all worries and losses  so brave and sensible did  they prove in their incessant daily struggle     apart  too  from the new buildings  the estate was increased by  five and seventy acres of woodland  and five and seventy acres of  sandy sloping soil  mathieu s battle with those sandy slopes became yet  keener  more and more heroic as his field of action expanded  but he  ended by conquering  by fertilizing them yet more each season  thanks to  the fructifying springs which he directed through them upon every side   and in the same way he cut broad roads through the new woods which  he purchased on the plateau  in order to increase the means of  communication and carry into effect his idea of using the clearings as  pasture for his cattle  pending the time when he might largely devote  himself to stock raising  in this wise  then  the battle went on   and spread incessantly in all directions  and the chances of decisive  victory likewise increased  compensation for possible loss on one side  being found on another where the harvest proved prodigious     and  like the estate  the children also grew  blaise and denis  the  twins  now already fourteen years of age  reaped prize after prize at  school  putting their younger brother  ambroise  slightly to shame  for  his quick and ingenious mind was often busy with other matters than his  lessons  gervais  the girls rose and claire  as well as the last born  boy  little gregoire  were yet too young to be trusted alone in paris   and so they continued growing in the open air of the country  without  any great mishap befalling them  and at the end of those two years  marianne gave birth to her eighth child  this time a girl  named louise   and when mathieu saw her smiling with the dear little babe in her arms   he embraced her passionately  and triumphed once again over every sorrow  and every pang  yet another child  yet more wealth and power  yet  an additional force born into the world  another field ready for  to morrow s harvest     and  twas ever the great work  the good work  the work of fruitfulness  spreading  thanks to the earth and thanks to woman  both victorious over  destruction  offering fresh means of subsistence each time a fresh child  was born  and loving  willing  battling  toiling  even amid suffering   and ever tending to increase of life and increase of hope                           then two more years rolled on  and during those two years mathieu and  marianne had yet another child  another daughter  whom they called  madeleine  and once again the estate of chantebled was increased  this  time by all the marshland whose ponds and whose springs remained to be  drained and captured on the west of the plateau  the whole of this part  of the property was now acquired by the froments  two hundred acres of  land where  hitherto  only water plants had grown  but which now was  given over to cultivation  and yielded abundant crops  and the new  springs  turned into canals on every side  again carried beneficent  life to the sandy slopes  and fertilized them  it was life s resistless  conquest  it was fruitfulness spreading in the sunlight  it was labor  ever incessantly pursuing its work of creation amid obstacles and  suffering  making good all losses  and at each succeeding hour setting  more energy  more health  and more joy in the veins of the world     this time it was seguin himself who asked mathieu to purchase a fresh  part of the estate  pressing him even to take all that was left of it   woods and moorland  extending over some five hundred acres  nowadays  seguin was often in need of money  and in order to do business he  offered mathieu lower terms and all sorts of advantages  but the other  prudently declined the proposals  keeping steadfastly to his original  intentions  which were that he would proceed with his work of creation  step by step  in accordance with his exact means and requirements   moreover  a certain difficulty arose with regard to the purchase of the  remaining moors  for enclosed by this land  eastward  near the railway  line  were a few acres belonging to lepailleur  the miller  who had  never done anything with them  and so mathieu preferred to select what  remained of the marshy plateau  adding  however  that he would enter  into negotiations respecting the moorland later on  when the miller  should have consented to sell his enclosure  he knew that  ever since  his property had been increasing  lepailleur had regarded him with the  greatest jealousy and hatred  and he did not think it advisable to  apply to him personally  certain as he felt that he would fail in his  endeavor  seguin  however  pretended that if he took up the matter  he would know how to bring the miller to reason  and even secure the  enclosure for next to nothing  and indeed  thinking that he might yet  induce mathieu to purchase all the remaining property  he determined to  see lepailleur and negotiate with him before even signing the deed which  was to convey to mathieu the selected marshland on the plateau     but the outcome proved as mathieu had foreseen  lepailleur asked such  a monstrous price for his few acres enclosed within the estate that  nothing could be done  when he was approached on the subject by seguin   he made little secret of the rage he felt at mathieu s triumph  he had  told the young man that he would never succeed in reaping an ear  of wheat from that uncultivated expanse  given over to brambles for  centuries past  and yet now it was covered with abundant crops  and this  had increased the miller s rancor against the soil  he hated it yet more  than ever for its harshness to him  a peasant s son  and its kindliness  towards that bourgeois  who seemed to have fallen from heaven expressly  to revolutionize the region  thus  in answer to seguin  he declared with  a sneer that since sorcerers had sprung up who were able to make wheat  sprout from stones  his patch of ground was now worth its weight in  gold  several years previously  no doubt  he had offered seguin the  enclosure for a trifle  but times had changed  and he now crowed loudly  over the other s folly in not entertaining his previous offer     on the other hand  there seemed little likelihood of his turning the  enclosure to account himself  for he was more disgusted than ever with  the tilling of the soil  his disposition had been further embittered by  the birth of a daughter  whom he would willingly have dispensed with   anxious as he was with respect to his son antonin  now a lad of twelve   who proved so sharp and quick at school that he was regarded by the  folks of janville as a little prodigy  mathieu had mortally offended  the father and mother by suggesting that antonin should be sent to  an agricultural college  a very sensible suggestion  but one which  exasperated them  determined as they were to make him a gentleman     as lepailleur would not part with his enclosure on any reasonable terms   seguin had to content himself for the time with selling mathieu the  selected marshland on the plateau  a deed of conveyance having been  prepared  they exchanged signatures  and then  on seguin s hands   there still remained nearly two hundred and fifty acres of woods in  the direction of lillebonne  together with the moorlands stretching to  vieux bourg  in which lepailleur s few acres were enclosed     it was on the occasion of the visits which he paid seguin in reference  to these matters that mathieu became acquainted with the terrible  break up of the other s home  the very rooms of the house in the avenue  d antin  particularly the once sumptuous  cabinet   spoke of neglect  and abandonment  the desire to cut a figure in society  and to carry the   fad  of the moment to extremes  ever possessed seguin  and thus he  had for a while renounced his pretended artistic tastes for certain new  forms of sport  the motor car craze  and so forth  but his only real  passion was horseflesh  and to this he at last returned  a racing stable  which he set up quickly helped on his ruin  women and gaming had been  responsible for the loss of part of his large fortune  and now horses  were devouring the remainder  it was said  too  that he gambled at the  bourse  in the hope of recouping himself for his losses on the turf  and  by way  too  of affecting an air of power and influence  for he allowed  it to be supposed that he obtained information direct from members of  the government  and as his losses increased and downfall threatened him   all that remained of the  bel esprit  and moralist  once so prone  to discuss literature and social philosophy with santerre  was an  embittered  impotent individual  one who had proclaimed himself a  pessimist for fashion s sake  and was now caught in his own trap  having  so spoilt his existence that he was now but an artisan of corruption and  death     all was disaster in his home  celeste the maid had long since been  dismissed  and the children were now in the charge of a certain german  governess called nora  who virtually ruled the house  her position with  respect to seguin was evident to one and all  but then  what of seguin s  wife and santerre  the worst was  that this horrible life  which seemed  to be accepted on either side  was known to the children  or  at all  events  to the elder daughter lucie  yet scarcely in her teens  there  had been terrible scenes with this child  who evinced a mystical  disposition  and was ever talking of becoming a nun when she grew up   gaston  her brother  resembled his father  he was brutal in his ways   narrow minded  supremely egotistical  very different was the little girl  andree  whom la catiche had suckled  she had become a pretty child  so  affectionate  docile  and gay  that she scarcely complained even of her  brother s teasing  almost bullying ways   what a pity   thought mathieu    that so lovable a child should have to grow up amid such surroundings      and then his thoughts turned to his own home  to chantebled  the debts  contracted at the outset of his enterprise had at last been paid  and he  alone was now the master there  resolved to have no other partners than  his wife and children  it was for each of his children that he conquered  a fresh expanse of land  that estate would remain their home  their  source of nourishment  the tie linking them together  even if they  became dispersed through the world in a variety of social positions  and  thus how decisive was that growth of the property  the acquisition  of that last lot of marshland which allowed the whole plateau to be  cultivated  there might now come yet another child  for there would be  food for him  wheat would grow to provide him with daily bread  and when  the work was finished  when the last springs were captured  and the  land had been drained and cleared  how prodigious was the scene at  springtide   with the whole expanse  as far as eye could see  one mass  of greenery  full of the promise of harvest  therein was compensation  for every tear  every worry and anxiety of the earlier days of labor     meantime mathieu  amid his creative work  received marianne s gay and  courageous assistance  and she was not merely a skilful helpmate  taking  a share in the general management  keeping the accounts  and watching  over the home  she remained both a loving and well loved spouse  and a  mother who nursed  reared  and educated her little ones in order to  give them some of her own sense and heart  as boutan remarked  it is  not enough for a woman to have a child  she should also possess healthy  moral gifts in order that she may bring it up in creditable fashion   marianne  for her part  made it her pride to obtain everything from her  children by dint of gentleness and grace  she was listened to  obeyed   and worshipped by them  because she was so beautiful  so kind  and  so greatly beloved  her task was scarcely easy  since she had eight  children already  but in all things she proceeded in a very orderly  fashion  utilizing the elder to watch over the younger ones  giving each  a little share of loving authority  and extricating herself from every  embarrassment by setting truth and justice above one and all  blaise  and denis  the twins  who were now sixteen  and ambroise  who was nearly  fourteen  did in a measure escape her authority  being largely in their  father s hands  but around her she had the five others  from rose  who  was eleven  to louise  who was two years old  between them  at intervals  of a couple of years  coming gervais  claire  and gregoire  and each  time that one flew away  as it were  feeling his wings strong enough for  flight  there appeared another to nestle beside her  and it was again a  daughter  madeleine  who came at the expiration of those two years  and  when mathieu saw his wife erect and smiling again  with the dear little  girl at her breast  he embraced her passionately and triumphed once  again over every sorrow and every pang  yet another child  yet more  wealth and power  yet an additional force born into the world  another  field ready for to morrow s harvest     and  twas ever the great work  the good work  the work of fruitfulness  spreading  thanks to the earth and thanks to woman  both victorious over  destruction  offering fresh means of subsistence each time a fresh child  was born  and loving  willing  battling  toiling even amid suffering   and ever tending to increase of life and increase of hope           xiii    two more years went by  and during those two years mathieu and marianne  had yet another daughter  and this time  as the family increased   chantebled also was increased by all the woodland extending eastward  of the plateau to the distant farms of mareuil and lillebonne  all the  northern part of the property was thus acquired  more than five hundred  acres of woods  intersected by clearings which roads soon connected  together  and those clearings  transformed into pasture land  watered  by the neighboring springs  enabled mathieu to treble his live stock and  attempt cattle raising on a large scale  it was the resistless conquest  of life  it was fruitfulness spreading in the sunlight  it was labor  ever incessantly pursuing its work of creation amid obstacles and  suffering  making good all losses  and at each succeeding hour setting  more energy  more health  and more joy in the veins of the world     since the froments had become conquerors  busily founding a little  kingdom and building up a substantial fortune in land  the beauchenes  no longer derided them respecting what they had once deemed their  extravagant idea in establishing themselves in the country  astonished  and anticipating now the fullest success  they treated them as  well to do relatives  and occasionally visited them  delighted with the  aspect of that big  bustling farm  so full of life and prosperity  it  was in the course of these visits that constance renewed her intercourse  with her former schoolfellow  madame angelin  the froments  neighbor  a  great change had come over the angelins  they had ended by purchasing a  little house at the end of the village  where they invariably spent the  summer  but their buoyant happiness seemed to have departed  they had  long desired to remain unburdened by children  and now they eagerly  longed to have a child  and none came  though claire  the wife  was as  yet but six and thirty  her husband  the once gay  handsome musketeer   was already turning gray and losing his eyesight  to such a degree   indeed  that he could scarcely see well enough to continue his  profession as a fan painter     when madame angelin went to paris she often called on constance  to  whom  before long  she confided all her worries  she had been in a  doctor s hands for three years  but all to no avail  and now during  the last six months she had been consulting a person in the rue de  miromesnil  a certain madame bourdieu  said she     constance at first made light of her friend s statements  and in part  declined to believe her  but when she found herself alone she felt  disquieted by what she had heard  perhaps she would have treated the  matter as mere idle tittle tattle  if she had not already regretted that  she herself had no second child  on the day when the unhappy morange had  lost his only daughter  and had remained stricken down  utterly alone in  life  she had experienced a vague feeling of anguish  since that supreme  loss the wretched accountant had been living on in a state of imbecile  stupefaction  simply discharging his duties in a mechanical sort of way  from force of habit  scarcely speaking  but showing great gentleness  of manner  he lived as one who was stranded  fated to remain forever  at beauchene s works  where his salary had now risen to eight thousand  francs a year  it was not known what he did with this amount  which was  considerable for a man who led such a narrow regular life  free from  expenses and fancies outside his home  that flat which was much too big  for him  but which he had  nevertheless  obstinately retained  shutting  himself up therein  and leading a most misanthropic life in fierce  solitude     it was his grievous prostration which had at one moment quite upset  and affected constance  so that she had even sobbed with the desolate  man  she whose tears flowed so seldom  no doubt a thought that she might  have had other children than maurice came back to her in certain bitter  hours of unconscious self examination  when from the depths of her  being  in which feelings of motherliness awakened  there rose vague  fear  sudden dread  such as she had never known before     yet maurice  her son  after a delicate youth which had necessitated  great care  was now a handsome fellow of nineteen  still somewhat pale   but vigorous in appearance  he had completed his studies in a fairly  satisfactory manner  and was already helping his father in the  management of the works  and his adoring mother had never set higher  hopes upon his head  she already pictured him as the master of that  great establishment  whose prosperity he would yet increase  thereby  rising to royal wealth and power     constance s worship for that only son  to morrow s hero  increased the  more since his father day by day declined in her estimation  till she  regarded him in fact with naught but contempt and disgust  it was a  logical downfall  which she could not stop  and the successive phases of  which she herself fatally precipitated  at the outset she had overlooked  his infidelity  then from a spirit of duty and to save him from  irreparable folly she had sought to retain him near her  and finally   failing in her endeavor  she had begun to feel loathing and disgust  he  was now two and forty  he drank too much  he ate too much  he smoked too  much  he was growing corpulent and scant of breath  with hanging lips  and heavy eyelids  he no longer took care of his person as formerly  but  went about slipshod  and indulged in the coarsest pleasantries  but it  was more particularly away from his home that he sank into degradation   indulging in the low debauchery which had ever attracted him  every now  and again he disappeared from the house and slept elsewhere  then he  concocted such ridiculous falsehoods that he could not be believed   or else did not take the trouble to lie at all  constance  who felt  powerless to influence him  ended by allowing him complete freedom     the worst was  that the dissolute life he led grievously affected the  business  he who had been such a great and energetic worker had lost  both mental and bodily vigor  he could no longer plan remunerative  strokes of business  he no longer had the strength to undertake  important contracts  he lingered in bed in the morning  and remained for  three or four days without once going round the works  letting disorder  and waste accumulate there  so that his once triumphal stock takings  now year by year showed a falling off  and what an end it was for that  egotist  that enjoyer  so gayly and noisily active  who had always  professed that money  capital increased tenfold by the labor of  others  was the only desirable source of power  and whom excess of money  and excess of enjoyment now cast with appropriate irony to slow ruin   the final paralysis of the impotent     but a supreme blow was to fall on constance and fill her with horror of  her husband  some anonymous letters  the low  treacherous revenge of  a dismissed servant  apprised her of beauchene s former intrigue with  norine  that work girl who had given birth to a boy  spirited away  none knew whither  though ten years had elapsed since that occurrence   constance could not think of it without a feeling of revolt  whither had  that child been sent  was he still alive  what ignominious existence  was he leading  she was vaguely jealous of the boy  the thought that her  husband had two sons and she but one was painful to her  now that  all her motherly nature was aroused  but she devoted herself yet more  ardently to her fondly loved maurice  she made a demi god of him  and  for his sake even sacrificed her just rancor  she indeed came to the  conclusion that he must not suffer from his father s indignity  and  so it was for him that  with extraordinary strength of will  she  ever preserved a proud demeanor  feigning that she was ignorant of  everything  never addressing a reproach to her husband  but remaining   in the presence of others  the same respectful wife as formerly   and even when they were alone together she kept silence and avoided  explanations and quarrels  never even thinking of the possibility of  revenge  she seemed  in the presence of her husband s profligacy   to attach herself more firmly to her home  clinging to her son  and  protected by him from thought of evil as much as by her own sternness  of heart and principles  and thus sorely wounded  full of repugnance  but hiding her contempt  she awaited the triumph of that son who would  purify and save the house  feeling the greatest faith in his strength   and quite surprised and anxious whenever  all at once  without  reasonable cause  a little quiver from the unknown brought her a chill   affecting her heart as with remorse for some long past fault which she  no longer remembered     that little quiver came back while she listened to all that madame  angelin confided to her  and at last she became quite interested in her  friend s case  and offered to accompany her some day when she might  be calling on madame bourdieu  in the end they arranged to meet one  thursday afternoon for the purpose of going together to the rue de  miromesnil     as it happened  that same thursday  about two o clock  mathieu  who had  come to paris to see about a threshing machine at beauchene s works  was  quietly walking along the rue la boetie when he met cecile moineaud  who  was carrying a little parcel carefully tied round with string  she was  now nearly twenty one  but had remained slim  pale  and weak  since  passing through the hands of dr  gaude  mathieu had taken a great liking  to her during the few months she had spent as a servant at chantebled   and later  knowing what had befallen her at the hospital  he had  regarded her with deep compassion  he had busied himself to find her  easy work  and a friend of his had given her some cardboard boxes to  paste together  the only employment that did not tire her thin weak  hands  so childish had she remained that one would have taken her for a  young girl suddenly arrested in her growth  yet her slender fingers were  skilful  and she contrived to earn some two francs a day in making the  little boxes  and as she suffered greatly at her parents  home  tortured  by her brutal surroundings there  and robbed of her earnings week by  week  her dream was to secure a home of her own  to find a little money  that would enable her to install herself in a room where she might  live in peace and quietness  it had occurred to mathieu to give her  a pleasant surprise some day by supplying her with the small sum she  needed      where are you running so fast   he gayly asked her     the meeting seemed to take her aback  and she answered in an evasive   embarrassed way   i am going to the rue de miromesnil for a call i have  to make      noticing his kindly air  however  she soon told him the truth  her  sister  that poor creature norine  had just given birth to another  child  her third  at madame bourdieu s establishment  a gentleman who  had been protecting her had cast her adrift  and she had been obliged  to sell her few sticks of furniture in order to get together a couple of  hundred francs  and thus secure admittance to madame bourdieu s house   for the mere idea of having to go to a hospital terrified her  whenever  she might be able to get about again  however  she would find herself  in the streets  with the task of beginning life anew at one and thirty  years of age      she never behaved unkindly to me   resumed cecile   i pity her with all  my heart  and i have been to see her  i am taking her a little chocolate  now  ah  if you only saw her little boy  he is a perfect love      the poor girl s eyes shone  and her thin  pale face became radiant with  a smile  the instinct of maternity remained keen within her  though she  could never be a mother      what a pity it is   she continued   that norine is so obstinately  determined on getting rid of the baby  just as she got rid of the  others  this little fellow  it s true  cries so much that she has had to  give him the breast  but it s only for the time being  she says that she  can t see him starve while he remains near her  but it quite upsets  me to think that one can get rid of one s children  i had an idea of  arranging things very differently  you know that i want to leave my  parents  don t you  well  i thought of renting a room and of taking my  sister and her little boy with me  i would show norine how to cut out  and paste up those little boxes  and we might live  all three  happily  together       and won t she consent   asked mathieu      oh  she told me that i was mad  and there s some truth in that  for  i have no money even to rent a room  ah  if you only knew how it  distresses me      mathieu concealed his emotion  and resumed in his quiet way   well   there are rooms to be rented  and you would find a friend to help you   only i am much afraid that you will never persuade your sister to keep  her child  for i fancy that i know her ideas on that subject  a miracle  would be needed to change them      quick witted as she was  cecile darted a glance at him  the friend he  spoke of was himself  good heavens would her dream come true  she ended  by bravely saying   listen  monsieur  you are so kind that you really  ought to do me a last favor  it would be to come with me and see norine  at once  you alone can talk to her and prevail on her perhaps  but let  us walk slowly  for i am stifling  i feel so happy      mathieu  deeply touched  walked on beside her  they turned the corner of  the rue de miromesnil  and his own heart began to beat as they climbed  the stairs of madame bourdieu s establishment  ten years ago  was it  possible  he recalled everything that he had seen and heard in that  house  and it all seemed to date from yesterday  for the building  had not changed  indeed  he fancied that he could recognize the very  grease spots on the doors on the various landings     following cecile to norine s room  he found norine up and dressed  but  seated at the side of her bed and nursing her babe      what  is it you  monsieur   she exclaimed  as soon as she recognized  her visitor   it is very kind of cecile to have brought you  ah   mon  dieu  what a lot of things have happened since i last saw you  we are  none of us any the younger      he scrutinized her  and she did indeed seem to him much aged  she was  one of those blondes who fade rapidly after their thirtieth year  still   if her face had become pasty and wore a weary expression  she remained  pleasant looking  and seemed as heedless  as careless as ever     cecile wished to bring matters to the point at once   here is your  chocolate   she began   i met monsieur froment in the street  and he is  so kind and takes so much interest in me that he is willing to help me  in carrying out my idea of renting a room where you might live and work  with me  so i begged him to come up here and talk with you  and prevail  on you to keep that poor little fellow of yours  you see  i don t want  to take you unawares  i warn you in advance      norine started with emotion  and began to protest   what is all this  again   said she   no  no  i don t want to be worried  i m too unhappy  as it is      but mathieu immediately intervened  and made her understand that if she  reverted to the life she had been leading she would simply sink lower  and lower  she herself had no illusions on that point  she spoke  bitterly enough of her experiences  her youth had flown  her good looks  were departing  and the prospect seemed hopeless enough  but then what  could she do  when one had fallen into the mire one had to stay there      ah  yes  ah  yes   said she   i ve had enough of that infernal life  which some folks think so amusing  but it s like a stone round my neck   i can t get rid of it  i shall have to keep to it till i m picked up in  some corner and carried off to die at a hospital      she spoke these words with the fierce energy of one who all at once  clearly perceives the fate which she cannot escape  then she glanced at  her infant  who was still nursing   he had better go his way and i ll go  mine   she added   then we shan t inconvenience one another      this time her voice softened  and an expression of infinite tenderness  passed over her desolate face  and mathieu  in astonishment  divining  the new emotion that possessed her  though she did not express it  made  haste to rejoin   to let him go his way would be the shortest way to  kill him  now that you have begun to give him the breast       is it my fault   she angrily exclaimed   i didn t want to give it to  him  you know what my ideas were  and i flew into a passion and almost  fought madame bourdieu when she put him in my arms  but then how could  i hold out  he cried so dreadfully with hunger  poor little mite  and  seemed to suffer so much  that i was weak enough to let him nurse just  a little  i didn t intend to repeat it  but the next day he cried again   and so i had to continue  worse luck for me  there was no pity shown  me  i ve been made a hundred times more unhappy than i should have been   for  of course  i shall soon have to get rid of him as i got rid of the  others      tears appeared in her eyes  it was the oft recurring story of the  girl mother who is prevailed upon to nurse her child for a few days  in  the hope that she will grow attached to the babe and be unable to part  from it  the chief object in view is to save the child  because its  best nurse is its natural nurse  the mother  and norine  instinctively  divining the trap set for her  had struggled to escape it  and repeated   sensibly enough  that one ought not to begin such a task when one meant  to throw it up in a few days  time  as soon as she yielded she was  certain to be caught  her egotism was bound to be vanquished by the wave  of pity  love  and hope that would sweep through her heart  the poor   pale  puny infant had weighed but little the first time he took the  breast  but every morning afterwards he had been weighed afresh  and on  the wall at the foot of the bed had been hung the diagram indicating the  daily difference of weight  at first norine had taken little interest in  the matter  but as the line gradually ascended  plainly indicating how  much the child was profiting  she gave it more and more attention  all  at once  as the result of an indisposition  the line had dipped down   and since then she had always feverishly awaited the weighing  eager to  see if the line would once more ascend  then  a continuous rise having  set in  she laughed with delight  that little line  which ever ascended   told her that her child was saved  and that all the weight and strength  he acquired was derived from her  from her milk  her blood  her flesh   she was completing the appointed work  and motherliness  at last  awakened within her  was blossoming in a florescence of love      if you want to kill him   continued mathieu   you need only take him  from your breast  see how eagerly the poor little fellow is nursing      this was indeed true  and norine burst into big sobs    mon dieu   you  are beginning to torture me again  do you think that i shall take any  pleasure in getting rid of him now  you force me to say things which  make me weep at night when i think of them  i shall feel as if my very  vitals were being torn out when this child is taken from me  there  are  you both pleased that you have made me say it  but what good does it do  to put me in such a state  since nobody can remedy things  and he must  needs go to the foundlings  while i return to the gutter  to wait for  the broom that s to sweep me away      but cecile  who likewise was weeping  kissed and kissed the child  and  again reverted to her dream  explaining how happy they would be  all  three of them  in a nice room  which she pictured full of endless joys   like some paradise  it was by no means difficult to cut out and paste up  the little boxes  as soon as norine should know the work  she  who was  strong  might perhaps earn three francs a day at it  and five francs a  day between them  would not that mean fortune  the rearing of the child   and all evil things forgotten  at an end  norine  more weary than ever   gave way at last  and ceased refusing      you daze me   she said   i don t know  do as you like  but certainly it  will be great happiness to keep this dear little fellow with me      cecile  enraptured  clapped her hands  while mathieu  who was greatly  moved  gave utterance to these deeply significant words   you have saved  him  and now he saves you      then norine at last smiled  she felt happy now  a great weight had been  lifted from her heart  and carrying her child in her arms she insisted  on accompanying her sister and their friend to the first floor     during the last half hour constance and madame angelin had been deep in  consultation with madame bourdieu  the former had not given her name   but had simply played the part of an obliging friend accompanying  another on an occasion of some delicacy  madame bourdieu  with the keen  scent characteristic of her profession  divined a possible customer in  that inquisitive lady who put such strange questions to her  however   a rather painful scene took place  for realizing that she could not  forever deceive madame angelin with false hopes  madame bourdieu decided  to tell the truth  her case was hopeless  constance  however  at last  made a sign to entreat her to continue deceiving her friend  if only for  charity s sake  the other  therefore  while conducting her visitors to  the landing  spoke a few hopeful words to madame angelin   after all   dear madame   said she   one must never despair  i did wrong to speak as  i did just now  i may yet be mistaken  come back to see me again      at this moment mathieu and cecile were still on the landing in  conversation with norine  whose infant had fallen asleep in her arms   constance and madame angelin were so surprised at finding the farmer  of chantebled in the company of the two young women that they pretended  they did not see him  all at once  however  constance  with the help of  memory  recognized norine  the more readily perhaps as she was now  aware that mathieu had  ten years previously  acted as her husband s  intermediary  and a feeling of revolt and the wildest fancies instantly  arose within her  what was mathieu doing in that house  whose child was  it that the young woman carried in her arms  at that moment the other  child seemed to peer forth from the past  she saw it in swaddling  clothes  like the infant there  indeed  she almost confounded one with  the other  and imagined that it was indeed her husband s illegitimate  son that was sleeping in his mother s arms before her  then all the  satisfaction she had derived from what she had heard madame bourdieu  say departed  and she went off furious and ashamed  as if soiled and  threatened by all the vague abominations which she had for some time  felt around her  without knowing  however  whence came the little chill  which made her shudder as with dread     as for mathieu  he saw that neither norine nor cecile had recognized  madame beauchene under her veil  and so he quietly continued explaining  to the former that he would take steps to secure for her from the  assistance publique  the official organization for the relief of  the poor  a cradle and a supply of baby linen  as well as immediate  pecuniary succor  since she undertook to keep and nurse her child   afterwards he would obtain for her an allowance of thirty francs a month  for at least one year  this would greatly help the sisters  particularly  in the earlier stages of their life together in the room which they had  settled to rent  when mathieu added that he would take upon himself the  preliminary outlay of a little furniture and so forth  norine insisted  upon kissing him      oh  it is with a good heart   said she   it does one good to meet a man  like you  and come  kiss my poor little fellow  too  it will bring him  good luck      on reaching the rue la boetie it occurred to mathieu  who was bound  for the beauchene works  to take a cab and let cecile alight near her  parents  home  since it was in the neighborhood of the factory  but she  explained to him that she wished  first of all  to call upon her sister  euphrasie in the rue caroline  this street was in the same direction   and so mathieu made her get into the cab  telling her that he would set  her down at her sister s door     she was so amazed  so happy at seeing her dream at last on the point of  realization  that as she sat in the cab by the side of mathieu she did  not know how to thank him  her eyes were quite moist  all smiles and  tears      you must not think me a bad daughter  monsieur   said she   because i m  so pleased to leave home  papa still works as much as he is able  though  he does not get much reward for it at the factory  and mamma does all  she can at home  though she hasn t much strength left her nowadays   since victor came back from the army  he has married and has children  of his own  and i m even afraid that he ll have more than he can provide  for  as  while he was in the army  he seems to have lost all taste for  work  but the sharpest of the family is that lazy bones irma  my younger  sister  who s so pretty and so delicate looking  perhaps because she s  always ill  as you may remember  mamma used to fear that irma might turn  out badly like norine  well  not at all  indeed  she s the only one of  us who is likely to do well  for she s going to marry a clerk in the  post office  and so the only ones left at home are myself and alfred   oh  he is a perfect bandit  that is the plain truth  he committed a  theft the other day  and one had no end of trouble to get him out of the  hands of the police commissary  but all the same  mamma has a weakness  for him  and lets him take all my earnings  yes  indeed  i ve had quite  enough of him  especially as he is always terrifying me out of my wits   threatening to beat and even kill me  though he well knows that ever  since my illness the slightest noise throws me into a faint  and as  all  considered  neither papa nor mamma needs me  it s quite excusable  isn t  it  that i should prefer living quietly alone  it is my right  is it  not  monsieur      she went on to speak of her sister euphrasie  who had fallen into a most  wretched condition  said she  ever since passing through dr  gaude s  hands  her home had virtually been broken up  she had become decrepit  a  mere bundle of rags  unable even to handle a broom  it made one tremble  to see her  then  after a pause  just as the cab was reaching the rue  caroline  the girl continued   will you come up to see her  you might  say a few kind words to her  it would please me  for i m going on a  rather unpleasant errand  i thought that she would have strength  enough to make some little boxes like me  and thus earn a few pence for  herself  but she has kept the work i gave her more than a month now  and  if she really cannot do it i must take it back      mathieu consented  and in the room upstairs he beheld one of the most  frightful  poignant spectacles that he had ever witnessed  in the centre  of that one room where the family slept and ate  euphrasie sat on a  straw bottomed chair  and although she was barely thirty years of age   one might have taken her for a little old woman of fifty  so thin and so  withered did she look that she resembled one of those fruits  suddenly  deprived of sap  that dry up on the tree  her teeth had fallen  and  of her hair she only retained a few white locks  but the more  characteristic mark of this mature senility was a wonderful loss of  muscular strength  an almost complete disappearance of will  energy   and power of action  so that she now spent whole days  idle  stupefied   without courage even to raise a finger     when cecile told her that her visitor was m  froment  the former chief  designer at the beauchene works  she did not even seem to recognize him   she no longer took interest in anything  and when her sister spoke  of the object of her visit  asking for the work with which she had  entrusted her  she answered with a gesture of utter weariness   oh  what  can you expect  it takes me too long to stick all those little bits of  cardboard together  i can t do it  it throws me into a perspiration      then a stout woman  who was cutting some bread and butter for the three  children  intervened with an air of quiet authority   you ought to take  those materials away  mademoiselle cecile  she s incapable of doing  anything with them  they will end by getting dirty  and then your people  won t take them back      this stout woman was a certain madame joseph  a widow of forty and a  charwoman by calling  whom benard  the husband  had at first engaged to  come two hours every morning to attend to the housework  his wife not  having strength enough to put on a child s shoes or to set a pot on  the fire  at first euphrasie had offered furious resistance to this  intrusion of a stranger  but  her physical decline progressing  she had  been obliged to yield  and then things had gone from bad to worse  till  madame joseph became supreme in the household  between times there had  been terrible scenes over it all  but the wretched euphrasie  stammering  and shivering  had at last resigned herself to the position  like some  little old woman sunk into second childhood and already cut off from the  world  that benard and madame joseph were not bad hearted in reality  was shown by the fact that although euphrasie was now but an useless  encumbrance  they kept her with them  instead of flinging her into the  streets as others would have done      why  there you are again in the middle of the room   suddenly exclaimed  the fat woman  who each time that she went hither and thither found  it necessary to avoid the other s chair   how funny it is that you can  never put yourself in a corner  auguste will be coming in for his four  o clock snack in a moment  and he won t be at all pleased if he doesn t  find his cheese and his glass of wine on the table      without replying  euphrasie nervously staggered to her feet  and with  the greatest trouble dragged her chair towards the table  then she sat  down again limp and very weary     just as madame joseph was bringing the cheese  benard  whose workshop  was near by  made his appearance  he was still a full bodied  jovial  fellow  and began to jest with his sister in law while showing great  politeness towards mathieu  whom he thanked for taking interest in his  unhappy wife s condition    mon dieu   monsieur   said he   it isn t her  fault  it is all due to those rascally doctors at the hospital  for a  year or so one might have thought her cured  but you see what has now  become of her  ah  it ought not to be allowed  you are no doubt aware  that they treated cecile just the same  and there was another  too   a baroness  whom you must know  she called here the other day to see  euphrasie  and  upon my word  i didn t recognize her  she used to be  such a fine woman  and now she looks a hundred years old  yes  yes  i  say that the doctors ought to be sent to prison      he was about to sit down to table when he stumbled against euphrasie s  chair  she sat watching him with an anxious  semi stupefied expression    there you are  in my way as usual   said he   one is always tumbling up  against you  come  make a little room  do      he did not seem to be a very terrible customer  but at the sound of  his voice she began to tremble  full of childish fear  as if she were  threatened with a thrashing  and this time she found strength enough to  drag her chair as far as a dark closet  the door of which was open  she  there sought refuge  ensconcing herself in the gloom  amid which one  could vaguely espy her shrunken  wrinkled face  which suggested that of  some very old great grandmother  who was taking years and years to die     mathieu s heart contracted as he observed that senile terror   that shivering obedience on the part of a woman whose harsh  dry   aggressively quarrelsome disposition he so well remembered  industrious   self willed  full of life as she had once been  she was now but a limp  human rag  and yet her case was recorded in medical annals as one of the  renowned gaude s great miracles of cure  ah  how truly had boutan spoken  in saying that people ought to wait to see the real results of those  victorious operations which were sapping the vitality of france     cecile  however  with eager affection  kissed the three children  who  somehow continued to grow up in that wrecked household  tears came  to her eyes  and directly madame joseph had given her back the  work materials entrusted to euphrasie she hurried mathieu away  and  as  they reached the street  she said   thank you  monsieur froment  i can  go home on foot now    how frightful  eh  ah  as i told you  we shall  be in paradise  norine and i  in the quiet room which you have so kindly  promised to rent for us      on reaching beauchene s establishment mathieu immediately repaired to  the workshops  but he could obtain no precise information respecting his  threshing machine  though he had ordered it several months previously   he was told that the master s son  monsieur maurice  had gone out on  business  and that nobody could give him an answer  particularly as the  master himself had not put in an appearance at the works that week  he  learnt  however  that beauchene had returned from a journey that very  day  and must be indoors with his wife  accordingly  he resolved to call  at the house  less on account of the threshing machine than to decide  a matter of great interest to him  that of the entry of one of his twin  sons  blaise  into the establishment     this big fellow had lately left college  and although he had only  completed his nineteenth year  he was on the point of marrying a  portionless young girl  charlotte desvignes  for whom he had conceived  a romantic attachment ever since childhood  his parents  seeing in this  match a renewal of their own former loving improvidence  had felt moved   and unwilling to drive the lad to despair  but  if he was to marry   some employment must first be found for him  fortunately this could  be managed  while denis  the other of the twins  entered a technical  school  beauchene  by way of showing his esteem for the increasing  fortune of his good cousins  as he now called the froments  cordially  offered to give blaise a situation at his establishment     on being ushered into constance s little yellow salon  mathieu found her  taking a cup of tea with madame angelin  who had come back with her from  the rue de miromesnil  beauchene s unexpected arrival on the scene had  disagreeably interrupted their private converse  he had returned from  one of the debauches in which he so frequently indulged under the  pretext of making a short business journey  and  still slightly  intoxicated  with feverish  sunken eyes and clammy tongue  he was  wearying the two women with his impudent  noisy falsehoods      ah  my dear fellow   he exclaimed on seeing mathieu   i was just  telling the ladies of my return from amiens    what wonderful duck pates  they have there      then  on mathieu speaking to him of blaise  he launched out into  protestations of friendship  it was understood  the young fellow need  only present himself at the works  and in the first instance he should  be put with morange  in order that he might learn something of the  business mechanism of the establishment  thus talking  beauchene puffed  and coughed and spat  exhaling meantime the odor of tobacco  alcohol   and musk  which he always brought back from his  sprees   while his wife  smiled affectionately before the others as was her wont  but directed at  him glances full of despair and disgust whenever madame angelin turned  her head     as beauchene continued talking too much  owning for instance that he did  not know how far the thresher might be from completion  mathieu  noticed constance listening anxiously  the idea of blaise entering the  establishment had already rendered her grave  and now her husband s  apparent ignorance of important business matters distressed her   besides  the thought of norine was reviving in her mind  she remembered  the girl s child  and almost feared some fresh understanding between  beauchene and mathieu  all at once  however  she gave a cry of great  relief   ah  here is maurice      her son was entering the room  her son  the one and only god on whom she  now set her affection and pride  the crown prince who to morrow would  become king  who would save the kingdom from perdition  and who  would exalt her on his right hand in a blaze of glory  she deemed him  handsome  tall  strong  and as invincible in his nineteenth year as  all the knights of the old legends  when he explained that he had just  profitably compromised a worrying transaction in which his father had  rashly embarked  she pictured him repairing disasters and achieving  victories  and she triumphed more than ever on hearing him promise that  the threshing machine should be ready before the end of that same week      you must take a cup of tea  my dear   she exclaimed   it would do you  good  you worry your mind too much      maurice accepted the offer  and gayly replied   oh  do you know  an  omnibus almost crushed me just now in the rue de rivoli      at this his mother turned livid  and the cup which she held escaped from  her hand  ah  god  was her happiness at the mercy of an accident  then  once again the fearful threat sped by  that icy gust which came she knew  not whence  but which ever chilled her to her bones      why  you stupid   said beauchene  laughing   it was he who crushed the  omnibus  since here he is  telling you the tale  ah  my poor maurice   your mother is really ridiculous  i know how strong you are  and i m  quite at ease about you      that day madame angelin returned to janville with mathieu  they found  themselves alone in the railway carriage  and all at once  without any  apparent cause  tears started from the young woman s eyes  at this she  apologized  and murmured as if in a dream   to have a child  to rear  him  and then lose him  ah  certainly one s grief must then be poignant   yet one has had him with one  he has grown up  and one has known for  years all the joy of having him at one s side  but when one never has a  child  never  never  ah  come rather suffering and mourning than such a  void as that      and meantime  at chantebled  mathieu and marianne founded  created   increased  and multiplied  again proving victorious in the eternal  battle which life wages against death  thanks to that continual increase  both of offspring and of fertile land  which was like their very  existence  their joy and their strength  desire passed like a gust of  flame  desire divine and fruitful  since they possessed the power of  love  of kindliness  and health  and their energy did the rest  that  will of action  that quiet bravery in the presence of the labor that  is necessary  the labor that has made and that regulates the world  yet  even during those two years it was not without constant struggling that  they achieved victory  true  victory was becoming more and more  certain as the estate expanded  the petty worries of earlier days had  disappeared  and the chief question was now one of ruling sensibly and  equitably  all the land had been purchased northward on the plateau   from the farm of mareuil to the farm of lillebonne  there was not a  copse that did not belong to the froments  and thus beside the surging  sea of corn there rose a royal park of centenarian trees  apart from  the question of felling portions of the wood for timber  mathieu was not  disposed to retain the remainder for mere beauty s sake  and accordingly  avenues were devised connecting the broad clearings  and cattle were  then turned into this part of the property  the ark of life  increased  by hundreds of animals  expanded  burst through the great trees  there  was a fresh growth of fruitfulness  more and more cattle sheds had to be  built  sheepcotes had to be created  and manure came in loads and loads  to endow the land with wondrous fertility  and now yet other children  might come  for floods of milk poured forth  and there were herds and  flocks to clothe and nourish them  beside the ripening crops the woods  waved their greenery  quivering with the eternal seeds that germinated  in their shade  under the dazzling sun  and only one more stretch of  land  the sandy slopes on the east  remained to be conquered in order  that the kingdom might be complete  assuredly this compensated one for  all former tears  for all the bitter anxiety of the first years of toil     then  while mathieu completed his conquest  there came to marianne  during those two years the joy of marrying one of her children even  while she was again  enceinte   for  like our good mother the earth  she  also remained fruitful   twas a delightful fete  full of infinite  hope  that wedding of blaise and charlotte  he a strong young fellow  of nineteen  she an adorable girl of eighteen summers  each loving  the other with a love of nosegay freshness that had budded  even in  childhood s hour  along the flowery paths of chantebled  the eight other  children were all there  first the big brothers  denis  ambroise  and  gervais  who were now finishing their studies  next rose  the eldest  girl  now fourteen  who promised to become a woman of healthy beauty  and happy gayety of disposition  then claire  who was still a child  and  gregoire  who was only just going to college  without counting the very  little ones  louise and madeleine     folks came out of curiosity from the surrounding villages to see the  gay troop conduct their big brother to the municipal offices  it was  a marvellous cortege  flowery like springtide  full of felicity  which  moved every heart  often  moreover  on ordinary holidays  when for the  sake of an outing the family repaired in a band to some village market   there was such a gallop in traps  on horseback  and on bicycles  while  the girls  hair streamed in the wind and loud laughter rang out from one  and all  that people would stop to watch the charming cavalcade   here  are the troops passing   folks would jestingly exclaim  implying that  nothing could resist those froments  that the whole countryside  was theirs by right of conquest  since every two years their number  increased  and this time  at the expiration of those last two years it  was again to a daughter  marguerite  that marianne gave birth  for a  while she remained in a feverish condition  and there were fears  too   that she might be unable to nurse her infant as she had done all the  others  thus  when mathieu saw her erect once more and smiling  with her  dear little marguerite at her breast  he embraced her passionately   and triumphed once again over every sorrow and every pang  yet another  child  yet more wealth and power  yet an additional force born into the  world  another field ready for to morrow s harvest     and  twas ever the great work  the good work  the work of fruitfulness  spreading  thanks to the earth and thanks to woman  both victorious over  destruction  offering fresh means of subsistence each time a fresh child  was born  and loving  willing  battling  toiling  even amid suffering   and ever tending to increase of life and increase of hope           xiv    two more years went by  and during those two years yet another child   this time a boy  was born to mathieu and marianne  and on this occasion   at the same time as the family increased  the estate of chantebled was  increased also by all the heatherland extending to the east as far as  the village of vieux bourg  and this time the last lot was purchased   the conquest of the estate was complete  the      acres of uncultivated  soil which seguin s father  the old army contractor  had formerly  purchased in view of erecting a palatial residence there were now   thanks to unremitting effort  becoming fruitful from end to end  the  enclosure belonging to the lepailleurs  who stubbornly refused to sell  it  alone set a strip of dry  stony  desolate land amid the broad green  plain  and it was all life s resistless conquest  it was fruitfulness  spreading in the sunlight  it was labor ever incessantly pursuing its  work of creation amid obstacles and suffering  making good all losses   and at each succeeding hour setting more energy  more health  and more  joy in the veins of the world     blaise  now the father of a little girl some ten months old  had been  residing at the beauchene works since the previous winter  he occupied  the little pavilion where his mother had long previously given birth to  his brother gervais  his wife charlotte had conquered the beauchenes by  her fair grace  her charming  bouquet like freshness  to such a point   indeed  that even constance had desired to have her near her  the  truth was that madame desvignes had made adorable creatures of her  two daughters  charlotte and marthe  at the death of her husband  a  stockbroker s confidential clerk  who had died  leaving her at thirty  years of age in very indifferent circumstances  she had gathered her  scanty means together and withdrawn to janville  her native place  where  she had entirely devoted herself to her daughters  education  knowing  that they would be almost portionless  she had brought them up extremely  well  in the hope that this might help to find them husbands  and it so  chanced that she proved successful     affectionate intercourse sprang up between her and the froments  the  children played together  and it was  indeed  from those first games  that came the love romance which was to end in the marriage of blaise  and charlotte  by the time the latter reached her eighteenth birthday  and married  marthe her sister  then fourteen years old  had become the  inseparable companion of rose froment  who was of the same age and as  pretty as herself  though dark instead of fair  charlotte  who had  a more delicate  and perhaps a weaker  nature than her gay  sensible  sister  had become passionately fond of drawing and painting  which  she had learnt at first simply by way of accomplishment  she had ended   however  by painting miniatures very prettily  and  as her mother  remarked  her proficiency might prove a resource to her in the event of  misfortune  certainly there was some of the bourgeois respect and esteem  for a good education in the fairly cordial greeting which constance  extended to charlotte  who had painted a miniature portrait of her  a  good though a flattering likeness     on the other hand  blaise  who was endowed with the creative fire of the  froments  ever striving  ever hard at work  became a valuable assistant  to maurice as soon as a brief stay in morange s office had made him  familiar with the business of the firm  indeed it was maurice who   finding that his father seconded him less and less  had insisted on  blaise and charlotte installing themselves in the little pavilion  in  order that the former s services might at all times be available  and  constance  ever on her knees before her son  could in this matter  only obey respectfully  she evinced boundless faith in the vastness of  maurice s intellect  his studies had proved fairly satisfactory  if he  was somewhat slow and heavy  and had frequently been delayed by youthful  illnesses  he had  nevertheless  diligently plodded on  as he was  far from talkative  his mother gave out that he was a reflective   concentrated genius  who would astonish the world by actions  not by  speech  before he was even fifteen she said of him  in her adoring way    oh  he has a great mind   and  naturally enough  she only acknowledged  blaise to be a necessary lieutenant  a humble assistant  one whose hand  would execute the sapient young master s orders  the latter  to her  thinking  was now so strong and so handsome  and he was so quickly  reviving the business compromised by the father s slow collapse  that  surely he must be on the high road to prodigious wealth  to that final  great triumph  indeed  of which she had been dreaming so proudly  so  egotistically  for so many years     but all at once the thunderbolt fell  it was not without some hesitation  that blaise had agreed to make the little pavilion his home  for he knew  that there was an idea of reducing him to the status of a mere piece  of machinery  but at the birth of his little girl he bravely decided  to accept the proposal  and to engage in the battle of life even as his  father had engaged in it  mindful of the fact that he also might in time  have a large family  but it so happened that one morning  when he went  up to the house to ask maurice for some instructions  he heard from  constance herself that the young man had spent a very bad night  and  that she had therefore prevailed on him to remain in bed  she did not  evince any great anxiety on the subject  the indisposition could only  be due to a little fatigue  indeed  for a week past the two cousins had  been tiring themselves out over the delivery of a very important order   which had set the entire works in motion  besides  on the previous day  maurice  bareheaded and in perspiration  had imprudently lingered in a  draught in one of the sheds while a machine was being tested     that evening he was seized with intense fever  and boutan was hastily  summoned  on the morrow  alarmed  though he scarcely dared to say it   by the lightning like progress of the illness  the doctor insisted on a  consultation  and two of his colleagues being summoned  they soon agreed  together  the malady was an extremely infectious form of galloping  consumption  the more violent since it had found in the patient a field  where there was little to resist its onslaught  beauchene was away from  home  travelling as usual  constance  for her part  in spite of the  grave mien of the doctors  who could not bring themselves to tell her  the brutal truth  remained  in spite of growing anxiety  full of a  stubborn hope that her son  the hero  the demi god necessary for her own  life  could not be seriously ill and likely to die  but only three  days elapsed  and during the very night that beauchene returned home   summoned by a telegram  the young fellow expired in her arms     in reality his death was simply the final decomposition of impoverished   tainted  bourgeois blood  the sudden disappearance of a poor  mediocre  being who  despite a facade of seeming health  had been ailing since  childhood  but what an overwhelming blow it was both for the mother and  for the father  all whose dreams and calculations it swept away  the  only son  the one and only heir  the prince of industry  whom they had  desired with such obstinate  scheming egotism  had passed away like a  shadow  their arms clasped but a void  and the frightful reality arose  before them  a moment had sufficed  and they were childless     blaise was with the parents at the bedside at the moment when maurice  expired  it was then about two in the morning  and as soon as possible  he telegraphed the news of the death to chantebled  nine o clock was  striking when marianne  very pale  quite upset  came into the yard to  call mathieu      maurice is dead      mon dieu   an only son  poor people      they stood there thunderstruck  chilled and trembling  they had simply  heard that the young man was poorly  they had not imagined him to be  seriously ill      let me go to dress   said mathieu   i shall take the quarter past ten  o clock train  i must go to kiss them      although marianne was expecting her eleventh child before long  she  decided to accompany her husband  it would have pained her to be  unable to give this proof of affection to her cousins  who  all things  considered  had treated blaise and his young wife very kindly  moreover   she was really grieved by the terrible catastrophe  so she and her  husband  after distributing the day s work among the servants  set  out for janville station  which they reached just in time to catch the  quarter past ten o clock train  it was already rolling on again when  they recognized the lepailleurs and their son antonin in the very  compartment where they were seated     seeing the froments thus together in full dress  the miller imagined  that they were going to a wedding  and when he learnt that they had  a visit of condolence to make  he exclaimed   oh  so it s just  the contrary  but no matter  it s an outing  a little diversion  nevertheless      since mathieu s victory  since the whole of the estate of chantebled had  been conquered and fertilized  lepailleur had shown some respect for his  bourgeois rival  nevertheless  although he could not deny the results  hitherto obtained  he did not altogether surrender  but continued  sneering  as if he expected that some rending of heaven or earth would  take place to prove him in the right  he would not confess that he had  made a mistake  he repeated that he knew the truth  and that folks would  some day see plainly enough that a peasant s calling was the very worst  calling there could be  since the dirty land had gone bankrupt and would  yield nothing more  besides  he held his revenge  that enclosure which  he left barren  uncultivated  by way of protest against the adjoining  estate which it intersected  the thought of this made him ironical      well   he resumed in his ridiculously vain  scoffing way   we are going  to paris too  yes  we are going to install this young gentleman there      he pointed as he spoke to his son antonin  now a tall  carroty fellow  of eighteen  with an elongated head  a few light colored bristles were  already sprouting on his chin and cheeks  and he wore town attire  with  a silk hat and gloves  and a bright blue necktie  after astonishing  janville by his success at school  he had displayed so much repugnance  to manual work that his father had decided to make  a parisian  of him      so it is decided  you have quite made up your mind   asked mathieu in a  friendly way      why  yes  why should i force him to toil and moil without the least  hope of ever enriching himself  neither my father nor i ever managed  to put a copper by with that wretched old mill of ours  why  the  mill stones wear away with rot more than with grinding corn  and the  wretched fields  too  yield far more pebbles than crowns  and so  as  he s now a scholar  he may as well try his fortune in paris  there s  nothing like city life to sharpen a man s wits      madame lepailleur  who never took her eyes from her son  but remained in  admiration before him as formerly before her husband  now exclaimed  with an air of rapture   yes  yes  he has a place as a clerk with maitre  rousselet  the attorney  we have rented a little room for him  i have  seen about the furniture and the linen  and to day s the great day  he  will sleep there to night  after we have dined  all three  at a good  restaurant  ah  yes  i m very pleased  he s making a start now       and he will perhaps end by being a minister of state   said mathieu   with a smile   who knows  everything is possible nowadays      it all typified the exodus from the country districts towards the towns   the feverish impatience to make a fortune  which was becoming general   even the parents nowadays celebrated their child s departure  and  accompanied the adventurer on his way  anxious and proud to climb the  social ladder with him  and that which brought a smile to the lips of  the farmer of chantebled  the bourgeois who had become a peasant  was  the thought of the double change  the miller s son going to paris   whereas he had gone to the earth  the mother of all strength and  regeneration     antonin  however  had also begun to laugh with the air of an artful  idler who was more particularly attracted by the free dissipation of  paris life   oh  minister   said he   i haven t much taste for that  i  would much sooner win a million at once so as to rest afterwards      delighted with this display of wit  the lepailleurs burst into noisy  merriment  oh  their boy would do great things  that was quite certain     marianne  her heart oppressed by thought of the mourning which awaited  her  had hitherto kept silent  she now asked  however  why little  therese did not form one of the party  lepailleur dryly replied that he  did not choose to embarrass himself with a child but six years old   who did not know how to behave  her arrival had upset everything in the  house  things would have been much better if she had never been born   then  as marianne began to protest  saying that she had seldom seen a  more intelligent and prettier little girl  madame lepailleur answered  more gently   oh  she s sharp  that s true enough  but one can t send  girls to paris  she ll have to be put somewhere  and it will mean a lot  of trouble  a lot of money  however  we mustn t talk about all that this  morning  since we want to enjoy ourselves      at last the train reached paris  and the lepailleurs  leaving the  northern terminus  were caught and carried off by the impetuously  streaming crowd     when mathieu and marianne alighted from their cab on the quai d orsay   in front of the beauchenes  residence  they recognized the seguins   brougham drawn up beside the foot pavement  and within it they perceived  the two girls  lucie and andree  waiting mute and motionless in their  light colored dresses  then  as they approached the door  they saw  valentine come out  in a very great hurry as usual  on recognizing them   however  she assumed an expression of deep pity  and spoke the words  required by the situation      what a frightful misfortune  is it not  an only son      then she burst out into a flood of words   you have hastened here  i  see  as i did  it is only natural  i heard of the catastrophe only by  chance less than an hour ago  and you see my luck  my daughters were  dressed  and i myself was dressing to take them to a wedding  a cousin  of our friend santerre is marrying a diplomatist  and  in addition  i am  engaged for the whole afternoon  well  although the wedding is fixed for  a quarter past eleven  i did not hesitate  but drove here before going  to the church  and naturally i went upstairs alone  my daughters have  been waiting in the carriage  we shall no doubt be a little late for  the wedding  but no matter  you will see the poor parents in their empty  house  near the body  which  i must say  they have laid out very nicely  on the bed  oh  it is heartrending      mathieu was looking at her  surprised to see that she did not age  the  fiery flame of her wild life seemed to scorch and preserve her  he knew  that her home was now completely wrecked  seguin openly lived with nora   the governess  for whom he had furnished a little house  it was there  even that he had given mathieu an appointment to sign the final transfer  of the chantebled property  and since gaston had entered the military  college of st  cyr  valentine had only her two daughters with her in the  spacious  luxurious mansion of the avenue d antin  which ruin was slowly  destroying      i think   resumed madame seguin   that i shall tell gaston to obtain  permission to attend the funeral  for i am not sure whether his father  is in paris  it s just the same with our friend santerre  he s starting  on a tour to morrow  ah  not only do the dead leave us  but it is  astonishing what a number of the living go off and disappear  life is  very sad  is it not  dear madame      as she spoke a little quiver passed over her face  the dread of the  coming rupture  which she had felt approaching for several months  past  amid all the skilful preparations of santerre  who had been long  maturing some secret plan  which she did not as yet divine  however  she  made a devout ecstatic gesture  and added   well  we are in the hands of  god      marianne  who was still smiling at the ever motionless girls in the  closed brougham  changed the subject   how tall they have grown  how  pretty they have become  your andree looks adorable  how old is your  lucie now  she will soon be of an age to marry       oh  don t let her hear you   retorted valentine   you would make her  burst into tears  she is seventeen  but for sense she isn t twelve   would you believe it  she began sobbing this morning and refusing to go  to the wedding  under the pretence that it would make her ill  she is  always talking of convents  we shall have to come to a decision about  her  andree  though she is only thirteen  is already much more womanly   but she is a little stupid  just like a sheep  her gentleness quite  upsets me at times  it jars on my nerves      then valentine  on the point of getting into her carriage  turned to  shake hands with marianne  and thought of inquiring after her health    really   said she   i lose my head at times  i was quite forgetting   and the baby you re expecting will be your eleventh child  will it now   how terrible  still it succeeds with you  and  ah  those poor people  whom you are going to see  their house will be quite empty now      when the brougham had rolled away it occurred to mathieu and marianne  that before seeing the beauchenes it might be advisable for them to call  at the little pavilion  where their son or their daughter in law might  be able to give them some useful information  but neither blaise nor  charlotte was there  they found only a servant who was watching over  the little girl  berthe  this servant declared that she had not seen  monsieur blaise since the previous day  for he had remained at the  beauchenes  near the body  and as for madame  she also had gone there  early that morning  and had left instructions that berthe was to be  brought to her at noon  in order that she might not have to come back  to give her the breast  then  as marianne in surprise began to put some  questions  the girl explained matters   madame took a box of drawing  materials with her  i fancy that she is painting a portrait of the poor  young man who is dead      as mathieu and marianne crossed the courtyard of the works  they felt  oppressed by the grave like silence which reigned in that great city of  labor  usually so full of noise and bustle  death had suddenly passed  by  and all the ardent life had at once ceased  the machinery had become  cold and mute  the workshops silent and deserted  there was not a sound   not a soul  not a puff of that vapor which was like the very breath of  the place  its master dead  it had died also  and the distress of the  froments increased when they passed from the works into the house  amid  absolute solitude  the connecting gallery was wrapt in slumber  the  staircase quivered amid the heavy silence  all the doors were open  as  in some uninhabited house  long since deserted  they found no servant  in the antechamber  and even the dim drawing room  where the blinds of  embroidered muslin were lowered  while the armchairs were arranged in a  circle  as on reception days  when numerous visitors were expected  at  first seemed to them to be empty  but at last they detected a shadowy  form moving slowly to and fro in the middle of the room  it was morange   bareheaded and frock coated  he had hastened thither at the first news  with the same air as if he had been repairing to his office  he seemed  to be at home  it was he who received the visitors in a scared way   overcome as he was by this sudden demise  which recalled to him his  daughter s abominable death  his heart wound had reopened  he was livid   all in disorder  with his long gray beard streaming down  while he  stepped hither and thither without a pause  making all the surrounding  grief his own     as soon as he recognized the froments he also spoke the words which came  from every tongue   what a frightful misfortune  an only son      then he pressed their hands  and whispered and explained that madame  beauchene  feeling quite exhausted  had withdrawn for a few moments  and  that beauchene and blaise were making necessary arrangements downstairs   and then  resuming his maniacal perambulations  he pointed towards an  adjoining room  the folding doors of which were wide open      he is there  on the bed where he died  there are flowers  it looks very  nice  you may go in      this room was maurice s bedchamber  the large curtains had been closely  drawn  and tapers were burning near the bed  casting a soft light on the  deceased s face  which appeared very calm  very white  the eyes closed  as if in sleep  between the clasped hands rested a crucifix  and  with the roses scattered over the sheet the bed was like a couch of  springtide  the odor of the flowers  mingling with that of the burning  wax  seemed rather oppressive amid the deep and tragic stillness  not  a breath stirred the tall  erect flames of the tapers  burning in the  semi obscurity  amid which the bed alone showed forth     when mathieu and marianne had gone in  they perceived their  daughter in law  charlotte  behind a screen near the door  lighted by a  little lamp  she sat there with a sketching block on her knees  making  a drawing of maurice s head as it rested among the roses  hard and  anguish bringing as was such work for one with so young a heart  she had  nevertheless yielded to the mother s ardent entreaties  and for three  hours past  pale  looking wondrously beautiful  her face showing all  the flower of youth  her blue eyes opening widely under her fine golden  hair  she had been there diligently working  striving to do her best   when mathieu and marianne approached her she would not speak  but simply  nodded  still a little color came to her cheeks  and her eyes smiled   and when the others  after lingering there for a moment in sorrowful  contemplation  had quietly returned to the drawing room  she resumed her  work alone  in the presence of the dead  among the roses and the tapers     morange was still walking the drawing room like a lost  wandering  phantom  mathieu remained standing there  while marianne sat down near  the folding doors  not another word was exchanged  the spell of waiting  continued amid the oppressive silence of the dim  closed room  when  some ten minutes had elapsed  two other visitors arrived  a lady and a  gentleman  whom the froments could not at first recognize  morange bowed  and received them in his dazed way  then  as the lady did not release  her hold of the gentleman s hand  but led him along  as if he were  blind  between the articles of furniture  so that he might not knock  against them  marianne and mathieu realized that the new comers were the  angelins     since the previous winter they had sold their little house at janville  to fix themselves in paris  for a last misfortune had befallen them  the  failure of a great banking house had carried away almost the whole of  their modest fortune  the wife had fortunately secured a post as one of  the delegates of the poor relief board  an inspectorship with various  duties  such as watching over the mothers and children assisted by the  board  and reporting thereon  and she was wont to say  with a sad smile   that this work of looking after the little ones was something of a  consolation for her  since it was now certain that she would never have  a child of her own  as for her husband  whose eyesight was failing more  and more  he had been obliged to relinquish painting altogether  and  he dragged out his days in morose desolation  his life wrecked   annihilated     with short steps  as if she were leading a child  madame angelin brought  him to an armchair near marianne and seated him in it  he had retained  the lofty mien of a musketeer  but his features had been ravaged by  anxiety  and his hair was white  though he was only forty four years of  age  and what memories arose at the sight of that sorrowful lady leading  that infirm  aged man  for those who had known the young couple   all tenderness and good looks  rambling along the secluded paths of  janville  amid the careless delights of their love     as soon as madame angelin had clasped marianne s hands with her own  trembling fingers  she also uttered in low  stammering accents  those  despairing words   ah  what a frightful misfortune  an only son      her eyes filled with tears  and she would not sit down before going  for a moment to see the body in the adjoining room  when she came back   sobbing in her handkerchief  she sank into an armchair between marianne  and her husband  he remained there motionless  staring fixedly with his  dim eyes  and silence fell again throughout the lifeless house  whither  the rumble of the works  now deserted  fireless and frozen  ascended no  longer     but beauchene  followed by blaise  at last made his appearance  the  heavy blow he had received seemed to have made him ten years older   it was as if the heavens had suddenly fallen upon him  never amid his  conquering egotism  his pride of strength and his pleasures  had he  imagined such a downfall to be possible  never had he been willing to  admit that maurice might be ill  such an idea was like casting a  doubt upon his own strength  he thought himself beyond the reach of  thunderbolts  misfortune would never dare to fall on him  and at the  first overwhelming moment he had found himself weak as a woman  weary  and limp  his strength undermined by his dissolute life  the slow  disorganization of his faculties  he had sobbed like a child before his  dead son  all his vanity crushed  all his calculations destroyed  the  thunderbolt had sped by  and nothing remained  in a minute his life had  been swept away  the world was now all black and void  and he remained  livid  in consternation at it all  his bloated face swollen with grief   his heavy eyelids red with tears     when he perceived the froments  weakness again came upon him  and he  staggered towards them with open arms  once more stifling with sobs      ah  my dear friends  what a terrible blow  and i wasn t here  when i  got here he had lost consciousness  he did not recognize me    is it  possible  a lad who was in such good health  i cannot believe it  it  seems to me that i must be dreaming  and that he will get up presently  and come down with me into the workshops      they kissed him  they pitied him  struck down like this upon his return  from some carouse or other  still intoxicated  perhaps  and tumbling  into the midst of such an awful disaster  his prostration increased by  the stupor following upon debauchery  his beard  moist with his tears   still stank of tobacco and musk     although he scarcely knew the angelins  he pressed them also in his  arms   ah  my poor friends  what a terrible blow  what a terrible blow      then blaise in his turn came to kiss his parents  in spite of his grief   and the horrible night he had spent  his face retained its youthful  freshness  yet tears coursed down his cheeks  for  working with maurice  day by day  he had conceived real friendship for him     the silence fell again  morange  as if unconscious of what went on  around him  as if he were quite alone there  continued walking softly  hither and thither like a somnambulist  beauchene  with haggard mien   went off  and then came back carrying some little address books  he  turned about for another moment  and finally sat down at a writing table  which had been brought out of maurice s room  little accustomed as he  was to grief  he instinctively sought to divert his mind  and began  searching in the little address books for the purpose of drawing up a  list of the persons who must be invited to the funeral  but his eyes  became blurred  and with a gesture he summoned blaise  who  after going  into the bedchamber to glance at his wife s sketch  was now returning  to the drawing room  thereupon the young man  standing erect beside the  writing table  began to dictate the names in a low voice  and then  amid  the deep silence sounded a low and monotonous murmur     the minutes slowly went by  the visitors were still waiting for  constance  at last a little door of the death chamber slowly opened  and  she entered that chamber noiselessly  without anybody knowing that she  was there  she looked like a spectre emerging out of the darkness into  the pale light of the tapers  she had not yet wept  her face was  livid  contracted  hardened by cold rage  her little figure  instead of  bending  seemed to have grown taller beneath the injustice of destiny   as if borne up by furious rebellion  yet her loss did not surprise her   she had immediately felt that she had expected it  although but a minute  before the death she had stubbornly refused to believe it possible  but  the thought of it had remained latent within her for long months  and  frightful evidence thereof now burst forth  she suddenly heard the  whispers of the unknown once more  and understood them  she knew  the meaning of those shivers which had chilled her  those vague   terror fraught regrets at having no other child  and that which had been  threatening her had come  irreparable destiny had willed it that her  only son  the salvation of the imperilled home  the prince of to morrow   who was to share his empire with her  should be swept away like a  withered leaf  it was utter downfall  she sank into an abyss  and she  remained tearless  fury dried her tears within her  yet  good mother  that she had always been  she suffered all the torment of motherliness  exasperated  poisoned by the loss of her child     she drew near to charlotte and paused behind her  looking at the profile  of her dead son resting among the flowers  and still she did not weep   she slowly gazed over the bed  filled her eyes with the dolorous scene   then carried them again to the paper  as if to see what would be left  her of that adored son  those few pencil strokes  when the earth should  have taken him forever  charlotte  divining that somebody was behind  her  started and raised her head  she did not speak  she had felt  frightened  but both women exchanged a glance  and what a heart pang  came to constance  amid that display of death  in the presence of the  void  the nothingness that was hers  as she gazed on the other s face   all love and health and beauty  suggesting some youthful star  whence  promise of the future radiated through the fine gold of wavy hair     but yet another pang came to constance at that moment  words which were  being whispered in the drawing room  near the door of the bedchamber   reached her distinctly  she did not move  but remained erect behind  charlotte  who had resumed her work  and eagerly lending ear  she  listened  not showing herself as yet  although she had already seen  marianne and madame angelin seated near the doorway  almost among the  folds of the hangings      ah   madame angelin was saying   the poor mother had a presentiment of  it  as it were  i saw that she felt very anxious when i told her my own  sad story  there is no hope for me  and now death has passed by  and no  hope remains for her      silence ensued once more  then  prompted by some connecting train of  thought  she went on   and your next child will be your eleventh  will  it not  eleven is not a number  you will surely end by having twelve      as constance heard those words she shuddered in another fit of that fury  which dried up her tears  by glancing sideways she could see that mother  of ten children  who was now expecting yet an eleventh child  she found  her still young  still fresh  overflowing with joy and health and hope   and she was there  like the goddess of fruitfulness  nigh to the funeral  bier at that hour of the supreme rending  when she  constance  was bowed  down by the irretrievable loss of her only child     but marianne was answering madame angelin   oh i don t think that at all  likely  why  i m becoming an old woman  you forget that i am already a  grandmother  here  look at that      so saying  she waved her hand towards the servant of her  daughter in law  charlotte  who  in accordance with the instructions  she had received  was now bringing the little berthe in order that  her mother might give her the breast  the servant had remained at  the drawing room door  hesitating  disliking to intrude on all that  mourning  but the child good humoredly waved her fat little fists   and laughed lightly  and charlotte  hearing her  immediately rose and  tripped across the salon to take the little one into a neighboring room      what a pretty child   murmured madame angelin   those little ones are  like nosegays  they bring brightness and freshness wherever they come      constance for her part had been dazzled  all at once  amid the  semi obscurity  starred by the flames of the tapers  amid the deathly  atmosphere  which the odor of the roses rendered the more oppressive   that laughing child had set a semblance of budding springtime  the  fresh  bright atmosphere of a long promise of life  and it typified  the victory of fruitfulness  it was the child s child  it was marianne  reviving in her son s daughter  a grandmother already  and she was  only forty one years old  marianne had smiled at that thought  but the  hatchet stroke rang out yet more frightfully in constance s heart  in  her case the tree was cut down to its very root  the sole scion had been  lopped off  and none would ever sprout again     for yet another moment she remained alone amid that nothingness  in that  room where lay her son s remains  then she made up her mind and passed  into the drawing room  with the air of a frozen spectre  they all rose   kissed her  and shivered as their lips touched her cold cheeks  which  her blood was unable to warm  profound compassion wrung them  so  frightful was her calmness  and they sought kind words to say to her   but she curtly stopped them      it is all over   said she   there is nothing to be said  everything is  ended  quite ended      madame angelin sobbed  angelin himself wiped his poor fixed  blurred  eyes  marianne and mathieu shed tears while retaining constance s hands  in theirs  and she  rigid and still unable to weep  refused consolation   repeating in monotonous accents   it is finished  nothing can give him  back to me  is it not so  and thus there remains nothing  all is ended   quite ended      she needed to be brave  for visitors would soon be arriving in a stream   but a last stab in the heart was reserved for her  beauchene  who  since her arrival had begun to cry again  could no longer see to write   moreover  his hand trembled  and he had to leave the writing table and  fling himself into an armchair  saying to blaise   there sit down there   and continue to write for me      then constance saw blaise seat himself at her son s writing table  in  his place  dip his pen in the inkstand and begin to write with the very  same gesture that she had so often seen maurice make  that blaise   that son of the froments  what  her dear boy was not yet buried  and  a froment already replaced him  even as vivacious  fast growing plants  overrun neighboring barren fields  that stream of life flowing around  her  intent on universal conquest  seemed yet more threatening   grandmothers still bore children  daughters suckled already  sons laid  hands upon vacant kingdoms  and she remained alone  she had but her  unworthy  broken down  worn out husband beside her  while morange  the  maniac  incessantly walking to and fro  was like the symbolical spectre  of human distress  one whose heart and strength and reason had been  carried away in the frightful death of his only daughter  and not a  sound came from the cold and empty works  the works themselves were  dead     the funeral ceremony two days later was an imposing one  the five  hundred workmen of the establishment followed the hearse  notabilities  of all sorts made up an immense cortege  it was much noticed that an old  workman  father moineaud  the oldest hand of the works  was one of the  pall bearers  indeed  people thought it touching  although the worthy  old man dragged his legs somewhat  and looked quite out of his element  in a frock coat  stiffened as he was by thirty years  hard toil  in the  cemetery  near the grave  mathieu felt surprised on being approached by  an old lady who alighted from one of the mourning coaches      i see  my friend   said she   that you do not recognize me      he made a gesture of apology  it was seraphine  still tall and slim  but  so fleshless  so withered that one might have thought she was a hundred  years old  cecile had warned mathieu of it  yet if he had not seen her  himself he would never have believed that her proud insolent beauty   which had seemed to defy time and excesses  could have faded so swiftly   what frightful  withering blast could have swept over her      ah  my friend   she continued   i am more dead than the poor fellow  whom they are about to lower into that grave  come and have a chat with  me some day  you are the only person to whom i can tell everything      the coffin was lowered  the ropes gave out a creaking sound  and there  came a little thud  the last  beauchene  supported by a relative  looked  on with dim  vacant eyes  constance  who had had the bitter courage to  come  and had now wept all the tears in her body  almost fainted  she  was carried away  driven back to her home  which would now forever be  empty  like one of those stricken fields that remain barren  fated to  perpetual sterility  mother earth had taken back her all     and at chantebled mathieu and marianne founded  created  increased  and  multiplied  again proving victorious in the eternal battle which  life wages against death  thanks to that continual increase  both of  offspring and of fertile land  which was like their very existence   their joy and their strength  desire passed like a gust of flame  desire  divine and fruitful  since they possessed the power of love  kindliness   and health  and their energy did the rest  that will of action  that  quiet bravery in the presence of the labor that is requisite  the labor  that has made and that regulates the world     still  during those two years it was not without constant battling that  victory remained to them  at last it was complete  piece by piece seguin  had sold the entire estate  of which mathieu was now king  thanks to his  prudent system of conquest  that of increasing his empire by degrees  as he gradually felt himself stronger  the fortune which the idler had  disdained and dissipated had passed into the hands of the toiler  the  creator  there were      acres  spreading from horizon to horizon   there were woods intersected by broad meadows  where flocks and herds  pastured  there was fat land overflowing with harvests  in the place  of marshes that had been drained  there was other land  each year of  increasing fertility  in the place of the moors which the captured  springs now irrigated  the lepailleurs  uncultivated enclosure alone  remained  as if to bear witness to the prodigy  the great human effort  which had quickened that desert of sand and mud  whose crops would  henceforth nourish so many happy people  mathieu devoured no other  man s share  he had brought his share into being  increasing the common  wealth  subjugating yet another small portion of this vast world  which  is still so scantily peopled and so badly utilized for human happiness   the farm  the homestead  had sprung up and grown in the centre of the  estate like a prosperous township  with inhabitants  servants  and live  stock  a perfect focus of ardent triumphal life  and what sovereign  power was that of the happy fruitfulness which had never wearied of  creating  which had yielded all these beings and things that had been  increasing and multiplying for twelve years past  that invading town  which was but a family s expansion  those trees  those plants  those  grain crops  those fruits whose nourishing stream ever rose under the  dazzling sun  all pain and all tears were forgotten in that joy of  creation  the accomplishment of due labor  the conquest of the future  conducting to the infinite of action     then  while mathieu completed his work of conquest  marianne during  those two years had the happiness of seeing a daughter born to her son  blaise  even while she herself was expecting another child  the branches  of the huge tree had begun to fork  pending the time when they would  ramify endlessly  like the branches of some great royal oak spreading  afar over the soil  there would be her children s children  her  grandchildren s children  the whole posterity increasing from generation  to generation  and yet how carefully and lovingly she still assembled  around her her own first brood  from blaise and denis the twins  now  one and twenty  to the last born  the wee creature who sucked in life  from her bosom with greedy lips  there were some of all ages in the  brood  a big fellow  who was already a father  others who went to  school  others who still had to be dressed in the morning  there were  boys  ambroise  gervais  gregoire  and another  there were girls  rose   nearly old enough to marry  claire  louise  madeleine  and marguerite   the last of whom could scarcely toddle  and it was a sight to see them  roam over the estate like a troop of colts  following one another at  varied pace  according to their growth  she knew that she could not keep  them all tied to her apron strings  it would be sufficient happiness if  the farm kept two or three beside her  she resigned herself to seeing  the younger ones go off some day to conquer other lands  such was the  law of expansion  the earth was the heritage of the most numerous race   since they had number on their side  they would have strength also  the  world would belong to them  the parents themselves had felt stronger   more united at the advent of each fresh child  if in spite of terrible  cares they had always conquered  it was because their love  their toil   the ceaseless travail of their heart and will  gave them the victory   fruitfulness is the great conqueress  from her come the pacific heroes  who subjugate the world by peopling it  and this time especially  when  at the lapse of those two years marianne gave birth to a boy  nicolas   her eleventh child  mathieu embraced her passionately  triumphing over  every sorrow and every pang  yet another child  yet more wealth and  power  yet an additional force born into the world  another field ready  for to morrow s harvest     and  twas ever the great work  the good work  the work of fruitfulness  spreading  thanks to the earth and thanks to woman  both victorious over  destruction  offering fresh means of subsistence each time a fresh child  was born  and loving  willing  battling  toiling even amid suffering   and ever tending to increase of life and increase of hope           xv    amid the deep mourning life slowly resumed its course at the beauchene  works  one effect of the terrible blow which had fallen on beauchene was  that for some weeks he remained quietly at home  indeed  he seemed to  have profited by the terrible lesson  for he no longer coined lies  no  longer invented pressing business journeys as a pretext for dissipation   he even set to work once more  and busied himself about the factory   coming down every morning as in his younger days  and in blaise he found  an active and devoted lieutenant  on whom he each day cast more and more  of the heavier work  intimates were most struck  however  by the manner  in which beauchene and his wife drew together again  constance was most  attentive to her husband  beauchene no longer left her  and they seemed  to agree well together  leading a very retired life in their quiet  house  where only relatives were now received     constance  on the morrow of maurice s sudden death  was like one who  has just lost a limb  it seemed to her that she was no longer whole  she  felt ashamed of being  as it were  disfigured  mingled  too  with her  loving sorrow for maurice there was humiliation at the thought that she  was no longer a mother  that she no longer had any heir apparent to her  kingdom beside her  to think that she had been so stubbornly determined  to have but one son  one child  in order that he might become the sole  master of the family fortune  the all powerful monarch of the future   death had stolen him from her  and the establishment now seemed to be  less her own  particularly since that fellow blaise and his wife and  his child  representing those fruitful and all invading froments  were  installed there  she could no longer console herself for having welcomed  and lodged them  and her one passionate  all absorbing desire was to  have another son  and thereby reconquer her empire     this it was which led to her reconciliation with her husband  and for  six months they lived together on the best of terms  then  however  came  another six months  and it was evident that they no longer agreed so  well together  for beauchene took himself off at times under the pretext  of seeking fresh air  and constance remained at home  feverish  her eyes  red with weeping     one day mathieu  who had come to grenelle to see his daughter in law   charlotte  was lingering in the garden playing with little berthe  who  had climbed upon his knees  when he was surprised by the sudden approach  of constance  who must have seen him from her windows  she invented a  pretext to draw him into the house  and kept him there nearly a quarter  of an hour before she could make up her mind to speak her thoughts   then  all at once  she began   my dear mathieu  you must forgive me for  mentioning a painful matter  but there are reasons why i should do so   nearly fifteen years ago  i know it for a fact  my husband had a child  by a girl who was employed at the works  and i also know that you acted  as his intermediary on that occasion  and made certain arrangements with  respect to that girl and her child  a boy  was it not      she paused for a reply  but mathieu  stupefied at finding her so well  informed  and at a loss to understand why she spoke to him of that sorry  affair after the lapse of so many years  could only make a gesture by  which he betrayed both his surprise and his anxiety      oh   said she   i do not address any reproach to you  i am convinced  that your motives were quite friendly  even affectionate  and that you  wished to hush up a scandal which might have been very unpleasant for  me  moreover  i do not desire to indulge in recriminations after so long  a time  my desire is simply for information  for a long time i did not  care to investigate the statements whereby i was informed of the affair   but the recollection of it comes back to me and haunts me persistently   and it is natural that i should apply to you  i have never spoken a word  on the subject to my husband  and indeed it is best for our tranquillity  that i should not attempt to extort a detailed confession from him  one  circumstance which has induced me to speak to you is that on an occasion  when i accompanied madame angelin to a house in the rue de miromesnil   i perceived you there with that girl  who had another child in her arms   so you have not lost sight of her  and you must know what she is doing   and whether her first child is alive  and in that case where he is  and  how he is situated      mathieu still refrained from replying  for constance s increasing  feverishness put him on his guard  and impelled him to seek the motive  of such a strange application on the part of one who was as a rule so  proud and so discreet  what could be happening  why did she strive to  provoke confidential revelations which might have far reaching effects   then  as she closely scanned him with her keen eyes  he sought to answer  her with kind  evasive words      you greatly embarrass me  and  besides  i know nothing likely to  interest you  what good would it do yourself or your husband to stir  up all the dead past  take my advice  forget what people may have told  you  you are so sensible and prudent       but she interrupted him  caught hold of his hands  and held them in her  warm  quivering grasp  never before had she so behaved  forgetting and  surrendering herself so passionately   i repeat   said she   that nobody  has anything to fear from me  neither my husband  nor that girl  nor  the child  cannot you understand me  i am simply tormented  i suffer at  knowing nothing  yes  it seems to me that i shall feel more at ease when  i know the truth  it is for myself that i question you  for my own peace  of mind     ah  if i could only tell you  if i could tell you      he began to divine many things  it was unnecessary for her to be more  explicit  he knew that during the past year she and her husband had been  hoping for the advent of a second child  and that none had come  as a  woman  constance felt no jealousy of norine  but as a mother she was  jealous of her son  she could not drive the thought of that child from  her mind  it ever and ever returned thither like a mocking insult now  that her hopes of replacing maurice were fading fast  day by day did  she dream more and more passionately of the other woman s son  wondering  where he was  what had become of him  whether he were healthy  and  whether he resembled his father      i assure you  my dear mathieu   she resumed   that you will really  bring me relief by answering me  is he alive  tell me simply whether he  is alive  but do not tell me a lie  if he is dead i think that i shall  feel calmer  and yet  good heavens  i certainly wish him no evil      then mathieu  who felt deeply touched  told her the simple truth      since you insist on it  for the benefit of your peace of mind  and  since it is to remain entirely between us and to have no effect on your  home  i see no reason why i should not confide to you what i know  but  that is very little  the child was left at the foundling hospital in  my presence  since then the mother  having never asked for news  has  received none  i need not add that your husband is equally ignorant   for he always refused to have anything to do with the child  is the lad  still alive  where is he  those are things which i cannot tell you  a  long inquiry would be necessary  if  however  you wish for my opinion   i think it probable that he is dead  for the mortality among these poor  cast off children is very great      constance looked at him fixedly   you are telling me the real truth  you  are hiding nothing   she asked  and as he began to protest  she went on    yes  yes  i have confidence in you  and so you believe that he is dead   ah  to think of all those children who die  when so many women would be  happy to save one  to have one for themselves  well  if you haven t been  able to tell me anything positive  you have at least done your best   thank you      during the ensuing months mathieu often found himself alone with  constance  but she never reverted to the subject  she seemed to set  her energy on forgetting all about it  though he divined that it still  haunted her  meantime things went from bad to worse in the beauchene  household  the husband gradually went back to his former life of  debauchery  in spite of all the efforts of constance to keep him near  her  she  for her part  clung to her fixed idea  and before long she  consulted boutan  there was a terrible scene that day between husband  and wife in the doctor s presence  constance raked up the story of  norine and cast it in beauchene s teeth  while he upbraided her in a  variety of ways  however  boutan s advice  though followed for a time   proved unavailing  and she at last lost confidence in him  then she  spent months and months in consulting one and another  she placed  herself in the hands of madame bourdieu  she even went to see la rouche   she applied to all sorts of charlatans  exasperated to fury at finding  that there was no real succor for her  she might long ago have had a  family had she so chosen  but she had elected otherwise  setting all her  egotism and pride on that only son whom death had snatched away  and now  the motherhood she longed for was denied her     for nearly two years did constance battle  and at last in despair she  was seized with the idea of consulting dr  gaude  he told her the brutal  truth  it was useless for her to address herself to charlatans  she  would simply be robbed by them  there was absolutely no hope for her   and gaude uttered those decisive words in a light  jesting way  as  though surprised and amused by her profound grief  she almost fainted  on the stairs as she left his flat  and for a moment indeed death seemed  welcome  but by a great effort of will she recovered self possession   the courage to face the life of loneliness that now lay before her   moreover  another idea vaguely dawned upon her  and the first time she  found herself alone with mathieu she again spoke to him of norine s boy      forgive me   said she   for reverting to a painful subject  but i am  suffering too much now that i know there is no hope for me  i am haunted  by the thought of that illegitimate child of my husband s  will you do  me a great service  make the inquiry you once spoke to me about  try to  find out if he is alive or dead  i feel that when i know the facts peace  may perhaps return to me      mathieu was almost on the point of answering her that  even if this  child were found again  it could hardly cure her of her grief at having  no child of her own  he had divined her agony at seeing blaise take  maurice s place at the works now that beauchene had resumed his  dissolute life  and daily intrusted the young man with more and more  authority  blaise s home was prospering too  charlotte had now given  birth to a second child  a boy  and thus fruitfulness was invading the  place and usurpation becoming more and more likely  since constance  could never more have an heir to bar the road of conquest  without  penetrating her singular feelings  mathieu fancied that she perhaps  wished to sound him to ascertain if he were not behind blaise  urging  on the work of spoliation  she possibly imagined that her request  would make him anxious  and that he would refuse to make the necessary  researches  at this idea he decided to do as she desired  if only to  show her that he was above all the base calculations of ambition      i am at your disposal  cousin   said he   it is enough for me that this  inquiry may give you a little relief  but if the lad is alive  am i to  bring him to you       oh  no  no  i do not ask that   and then  gesticulating almost wildly   she stammered   i don t know what i want  but i suffer so dreadfully  that i am scarce able to live      in point of fact a tempest raged within her  but she really had no  settled plan  one could hardly say that she really thought of that  boy as a possible heir  in spite of her hatred of all conquerors from  without  was it likely that she would accept him as a conqueror  in  the face of her outraged womanly feelings and her bourgeois horror  of illegitimacy  and yet if he were not her son  he was at least her  husband s  and perhaps an idea of saving her empire by placing the works  in the hands of that heir was dimly rising within her  above all her  prejudices and her rancor  but however that might be  her feelings for  the time remained confused  and the only clear thing was her desperate  torment at being now and forever childless  a torment which goaded her  on to seek another s child with the wild idea of making that child in  some slight degree her own     mathieu  however  asked her   am i to inform beauchene of the steps i  take       do you as you please   she answered   still  that would be the best      that same evening there came a complete rupture between herself and her  husband  she threw in beauchene s face all the contempt and loathing  that she had felt for him for years  hopeless as she was  she revenged  herself by telling him everything that she had on her heart and  mind  and her slim dark figure  upborne by bitter rage  assumed such  redoubtable proportions in his eyes that he felt frightened by her and  fled  henceforth they were husband and wife in name only  it was logic  on the march  it was the inevitable disorganization of a household  reaching its climax  it was rebellion against nature s law and  indulgence in vice leading to the gradual decline of a man of  intelligence  it was a hard worker sinking into the sloth of so called  pleasure  and then  death having snatched away the only son  the home  broke to pieces  the wife  fated to childlessness  and the husband  driven away by her  rolling through debauchery towards final ruin     but mathieu  keeping his promise to constance  discreetly began his  researches  and before he even consulted beauchene it occurred to him to  apply at the foundling hospital  if  as he anticipated  the child were  dead  the affair would go no further  fortunately enough he remembered  all the particulars  the two names  alexandre honore  given to the  child  the exact date of the deposit at the hospital  indeed all the  little incidents of the day when he had driven thither with la couteau   and when he was received by the director of the establishment  and had  explained to him the real motives of his inquiries  at the same time  giving his name  he was surprised by the promptness and precision of  the answer  alexandre honore  put out to nurse with the woman loiseau  at rougemont  had first kept cows  and had then tried the calling of a  locksmith  but for three months past he had been in apprenticeship with  a wheelwright  a certain montoir  residing at saint pierre  a hamlet in  the vicinity of rougemont  thus the lad lived  he was fifteen years old   and that was all  mathieu could obtain no further information respecting  either his physical health or his morality     when mathieu found himself in the street again  slightly dazed  he  remembered that la couteau had told him that the child would be sent  to rougemont  he had always pictured it dying there  carried off by the  hurricane which killed so many babes  and lying in the silent village  cemetery paved with little parisians  to find the boy alive  saved  from the massacre  came like a surprise of destiny  and brought vague  anguish  a fear of some terrible catastrophe to mathieu s heart  at the  same time  since the boy was living  and he now knew where to seek him   he felt that he must warn beauchene  the matter was becoming serious   and it seemed to him that he ought not to carry the inquiry any further  without the father s authorization     that same day  then  before returning to chantebled  he repaired to  the factory  where he was lucky enough to find beauchene  whom blaise s  absence on business had detained there by force  thus he was in a very  bad humor  puffing and yawning and half asleep  it was nearly three  o clock  and he declared that he could never digest his lunch properly  unless he went out afterwards  the truth was that since his rupture with  his wife he had been devoting his afternoons to paying attentions to a  girl serving at a beer house      ah  my good fellow   he muttered as he stretched himself   my blood is  evidently thickening  i must bestir myself  or else i shall be in a bad  way      however  he woke up when mathieu had explained the motive of his visit   at first he could scarcely understand it  for the affair seemed to him  so extraordinary  so idiotic      eh  what do you say  it was my wife who spoke to you about that child   it is she who has taken it into her head to collect information and  start a search      his fat apoplectical face became distorted  his anger was so violent  that he could scarcely stutter  when he heard  however  of the mission  with which his wife had intrusted mathieu  he at last exploded   she  is mad  i tell you that she is raving mad  were such fancies ever seen   every morning she invents something fresh to distract me      without heeding this interruption  mathieu quietly finished his  narrative   and so i have just come back from the foundling hospital   where i learnt that the boy is alive  i have his address  and now what  am i to do      this was the final blow  beauchene clenched his fists and raised his  arms in exasperation   ah  well  here s a nice state of things  but why  on earth does she want to trouble me about that boy  he isn t hers  why  can t she leave us alone  the boy and me  it s my affair  and i ask you  if it is at all proper for my wife to send you running about after him   besides  i hope that you are not going to bring him to her  what on  earth could we do with that little peasant  who may have every vice   just picture him coming between us  i tell you that she is mad  mad   mad      he had begun to walk angrily to and fro  all at once he stopped   my  dear fellow  you will just oblige me by telling her that he is dead      but he turned pale and recoiled  constance stood on the threshold  and had heard him  for some time past she had been in the habit of  stealthily prowling around the offices  like one on the watch for  something  for a moment  at the sight of the embarrassment which both  men displayed  she remained silent  then  without even addressing her  husband  she asked   he is alive  is he not      mathieu could but tell her the truth  he answered with a nod  then  beauchene  in despair  made a final effort   come  be reasonable   my dear  as i was saying only just now  we don t even know what this  youngster s character is  you surely don t want to upset our life for  the mere pleasure of doing so      standing there  lean and frigid  she gave him a harsh glance  then   turning her back on him  she demanded the child s name  and the names of  the wheelwright and the locality   good  you say alexandre honore  with  montoir the wheelwright  at saint pierre  near rougemont  in calvados   well  my friend  oblige me by continuing your researches  endeavor  to procure me some precise information about this boy s habits and  disposition  be prudent  too  don t give anybody s name  and thanks for  what you have done already  thanks for all you are doing for me      thereupon she took herself off without giving any further explanation   without even telling her husband of the vague plans she was forming   beneath her crushing contempt he had grown calm again  why should he  spoil his life of egotistical pleasure by resisting that mad creature   all that he need do was to put on his hat and betake himself to his  usual diversions  and so he ended by shrugging his shoulders      after all  let her pick him up if she chooses  it won t be my doing   act as she asks you  my dear fellow  continue your researches and try to  content her  perhaps she will then leave me in peace  but i ve had quite  enough of it for to day  good by  i m going out      with the view of obtaining some information of rougemont  mathieu at  first thought of applying to la couteau  if he could find her again  for  which purpose it occurred to him that he might call on madame bourdieu  in the rue de miromesnil  but another and more certain means suggested  itself  he had been led to renew his intercourse with the seguins  of  whom he had for a time lost sight  and  much to his surprise  he had  found valentine s former maid  celeste  in the avenue d antin once more   through this woman  he thought  he might reach la couteau direct     the renewal of the intercourse between the froments and the seguins was  due to a very happy chance  mathieu s son ambroise  on leaving college   had entered the employment of an uncle of seguin s  thomas du hordel   one of the wealthiest commission merchants in paris  and this old man   who  despite his years  remained very sturdy  and still directed his  business with all the fire of youth  had conceived a growing fondness  for ambroise  who had great mental endowments and a real genius for  commerce  du hordel s own children had consisted of two daughters  one  of whom had died young  while the other had married a madman  who had  lodged a bullet in his head and had left her childless and crazy like  himself  this partially explained the deep grandfatherly interest which  du hordel took in young ambroise  who was the handsomest of all the  froments  with a clear complexion  large black eyes  brown hair that  curled naturally  and manners of much refinement and elegance  but  the old man was further captivated by the young fellow s spirit of  enterprise  the four modern languages which he spoke so readily  and  the evident mastery which he would some day show in the management of  a business which extended over the five parts of the world  in his  childhood  among his brothers and sisters  ambroise had always been the  boldest  most captivating and self assertive  the others might be better  than he  but he reigned over them like a handsome  ambitious  greedy  boy  a future man of gayety and conquest  and this indeed he proved to  be  by the charm of his victorious intellect he conquered old du hordel  in a few months  even as later on he was destined to vanquish everybody  and everything much as he pleased  his strength lay in his power of  pleasing and his power of action  a blending of grace with the most  assiduous industry     about this time seguin and his uncle  who had never set foot in the  house of the avenue d antin since insanity had reigned there  drew  together again  their apparent reconciliation was the outcome of a drama  shrouded in secrecy  seguin  hard up and in debt  cast off by nora   who divined his approaching ruin  and preyed upon by other voracious  creatures  had ended by committing  on the turf  one of those indelicate  actions which honest people call thefts  du hordel  on being apprised of  the matter  had hastened forward and had paid what was due in order  to avoid a frightful scandal  and he was so upset by the extraordinary  muddle in which he found his nephew s home  once all prosperity  that  remorse came upon him as if he were in some degree responsible for what  had happened  since he had egotistically kept away from his relatives  for his own peace s sake  but he was more particularly won over by his  grandniece andree  now a delicious young girl well nigh eighteen years  of age  and therefore marriageable  she alone sufficed to attract him  to the house  and he was greatly distressed by the dangerous state of  abandonment in which he found her     her father continued dragging out his worthless life away from home  her  mother  valentine  had just emerged from a frightful crisis  her final  rupture with santerre  who had made up his mind to marry a very wealthy  old lady  which  after all  was the logical destiny of such a crafty  exploiter of women  one who behind his affectation of cultured pessimism  had the vilest and greediest of natures  valentine  distracted by this  rupture  had now thrown herself into religion  and  like her husband   disappeared from the house for whole days  she was said to be an  active helpmate of old count de navarede  the president of a society of  catholic propaganda  gaston  her son  having left saint cyr three months  previously  was now at the cavalry school of saumur  so fired with  passion for a military career that he already spoke of remaining a  bachelor  since a soldier s sword should be his only love  his only  spouse  then lucie  now nineteen years old  and full of mystical  exaltation  had already entered an ursuline convent for her novitiate   and in the big empty home  whence father  mother  brother and sister  fled  there remained but the gentle and adorable andree  exposed to all  the blasts of insanity which even now swept through the household   and so distressed by loneliness  that her uncle  du hordel  full of  compassionate affection  conceived the idea of giving her a husband in  the person of young ambroise  the future conqueror     this plan was helped on by the renewed presence of celeste the maid   eight years had elapsed since valentine had been obliged to dismiss this  woman for immorality  and during those eight years celeste  weary of  service  had tried a number of equivocal callings of which she did not  speak  she had ended by turning up at rougemont  her native place  in  bad health and such a state of wretchedness  that for the sake of a  living she went out as a charwoman there  then she gradually recovered  her health  and accumulated a little stock of clothes  thanks to the  protection of the village priest  whom she won over by an affectation  of extreme piety  it was at rougemont  no doubt  that she planned her  return to the seguins  of whose vicissitudes she was informed by la  couteau  the latter having kept up her intercourse with madame menoux   the little haberdasher of the neighborhood     valentine  shortly after her rupture with santerre  one day of furious  despair  when she had again dismissed all her servants  was surprised by  the arrival of celeste  who showed herself so repentant  so devoted  and  so serious minded  that her former mistress felt touched  she made her  weep on reminding her of her faults  and asking her to swear before god  that she would never repeat them  for celeste now went to confession and  partook of the holy communion  and carried with her a certificate from  the cure of rougemont vouching for her deep piety and high morality   this certificate acted decisively on valentine  who  unwilling to remain  at home  and weary of the troubles of housekeeping  understood what  precious help she might derive from this woman  on her side celeste  certainly relied upon power being surrendered to her  two months later   by favoring lucie s excessive partiality to religious practices  she had  helped her into a convent  gaston showed himself only when he secured a  few days  leave  and so andree alone remained at home  impeding by her  presence the great general pillage that celeste dreamt of  the maid  therefore became a most active worker on behalf of her young mistress s  marriage     andree  it should be said  was comprised in ambroise s universal  conquest  she had met him at her uncle du hordel s house for a year  before it occurred to the latter to marry them  she was a very gentle  girl  a little golden haired sheep  as her mother sometimes said  and  that handsome  smiling young man  who evinced so much kindness towards  her  became the subject of her thoughts and hopes whenever she suffered  from loneliness and abandonment  thus  when her uncle prudently  questioned her  she flung herself into his arms  weeping big tears  of gratitude and confession  valentine  on being approached  at first  manifested some surprise  what  a son of the froments  those froments  had already taken chantebled from them  and did they now want to  take one of their daughters  then  amid the collapse of fortune and  household  she could find no reasonable objection to urge  she had never  been attached to andree  she accused la catiche  the nurse  of having  made the child her own  that gentle  docile  emotional little sheep was  not a seguin  she often remarked  then  while feigning to defend the  girl  celeste embittered her mother against her  and inspired her with  a desire to see the marriage promptly concluded  in order that she might  free herself from her last cares and live as she wished  thus  after a  long chat with mathieu  who promised his consent  it remained only for  du hordel to assure himself of seguin s approval before an application  in due form was made  it was difficult  however  to find seguin in a  suitable frame of mind  so weeks were lost  and it became necessary to  pacify ambroise  who was very much in love  and was doubtless warned by  his all invading genius that this loving and simple girl would bring him  a kingdom in her apron     one day when mathieu was passing along the avenue d antin  it occurred  to him to call at the house to ascertain if seguin had re appeared  there  for he had suddenly taken himself off without warning  and had  gone  so it was believed  to italy  then  as mathieu found himself alone  with celeste  the opportunity seemed to him an excellent one to discover  la couteau s whereabouts  he asked for news of her  saying that a friend  of his was in need of a good nurse      well  monsieur  you are in luck s way   the maid replied   la couteau  is to bring a child home to our neighbor  madame menoux  this very day   it is nearly four o clock now  and that is the time when she promised to  come  you know madame menoux s place  do you not  it is the third shop  in the first street on the left   then she apologized for being unable  to conduct him thither   i am alone   she said   we still have no news  of the master  on wednesdays madame presides at the meeting of her  society  and mademoiselle andree has just gone out walking with her  uncle      mathieu hastily repaired to madame menoux s shop  from a distance he saw  her standing on the threshold  age had made her thinner than ever  at  forty she was as slim as a young girl  with a long and pointed face   silent labor consumed her  for twenty years she had been desperately  selling bits of cotton and packages of needles without ever making a  fortune  but pleased  nevertheless  at being able to add her modest  gains to her husband s monthly salary in order to provide him with  sundry little comforts  his rheumatism would no doubt soon compel him to  relinquish his post as a museum attendant  and how would they be able to  manage with his pension of a few hundred francs per annum if she did not  keep up her business  moreover  they had met with no luck  their first  child had died  and some years had elapsed before the birth of a second  boy  whom they had greeted with delight  no doubt  though he would prove  a heavy burden to them  especially as they had now decided to take him  back from the country  thus mathieu found the worthy woman in a state of  great emotion  waiting for the child on the threshold of her shop  and  watching the corner of the avenue      oh  it was celeste who sent you  monsieur  no  la couteau hasn t come  yet  i m quite astonished at it  i expect her every moment  will you  kindly step inside  monsieur  and sit down      he refused the only chair which blocked up the narrow passage where  scarcely three customers could have stood in a row  behind a glass  partition one perceived the dim back shop  which served as kitchen and  dining room and bedchamber  and which received only a little air from a  damp inner yard which suggested a sewer shaft      as you see  monsieur  we have scarcely any room   continued madame  menoux   but then we pay only eight hundred francs rent  and where else  could we find a shop at that price  and besides  i have been here for  nearly twenty years  and have worked up a little regular custom in the  neighborhood  oh  i don t complain of the place myself  i m not big   there is always sufficient room for me  and as my husband comes home  only in the evening  and then sits down in his armchair to smoke his  pipe  he isn t so much inconvenienced  i do all i can for him  and he is  reasonable enough not to ask me to do more  but with a child i fear that  it will be impossible to get on here      the recollection of her first boy  her little pierre  returned to her   and her eyes filled with tears   ah  monsieur  that was ten years ago   and i can still see la couteau bringing him back to me  just as she ll  be bringing the other by and by  i was told so many tales  there was  such good air at rougemont  and the children led such healthy lives  and  my boy had such rosy cheeks  that i ended by leaving him there till he  was five years old  regretting that i had no room for him here  and no   you can t have an idea of all the presents that the nurse wheedled out  of me  of all the money that i paid  it was ruination  and then  all at  once  i had just time to send for the boy  and he was brought back to me  as thin and pale and weak  as if he had never tasted good bread in his  life  two months later he died in my arms  his father fell ill over it   and if we hadn t been attached to one another  i think we should both  have gone and drowned ourselves      scarce wiping her eyes she feverishly returned to the threshold  and  again cast a passionate expectant glance towards the avenue  and when  she came back  having seen nothing  she resumed   so you will understand  our emotion when  two years ago  though i was thirty seven  i again had  a little boy  we were wild with delight  like a young married couple   but what a lot of trouble and worry  we had to put the little fellow out  to nurse as we let the other one  since we could not possibly keep him  here  and even after swearing that he should not go to rougemont we  ended by saying that we at least knew the place  and that he would not  be worse off there than elsewhere  only we sent him to la vimeux  for we  wouldn t hear any more of la loiseau since she sent pierre back in such  a fearful state  and this time  as the little fellow is now two years  old  i was determined to have him home again  though i don t even know  where i shall put him  i ve been waiting for an hour now  and i can t  help trembling  for i always fear some catastrophe      she could not remain in the shop  but remained standing by the doorway   with her neck outstretched and her eyes fixed on the street corner  all  at once a deep cry came from her   ah  here they are      leisurely  and with a sour  harassed air  la couteau came in and placed  the sleeping child in madame menoux s arms  saying as she did so   well   your george is a tidy weight  i can tell you  you won t say that i ve  brought you this one back like a skeleton      quivering  her legs sinking beneath her for very joy  the mother had  been obliged to sit down  keeping her child on her knees  kissing him   examining him  all haste to see if he were in good health and likely to  live  he had a fat and rather pale face  and seemed big  though puffy   when she had unfastened his wraps  her hands trembling the while with  nervousness  she found that he was pot bellied  with small legs and  arms      he is very big about the body   she murmured  ceasing to smile  and  turning gloomy with renewed fears      ah  yes  complain away   said la couteau   the other was too thin  this  one will be too fat  mothers are never satisfied      at the first glance mathieu had detected that the child was one of those  who are fed on pap  stuffed for economy s sake with bread and water   and fated to all the stomachic complaints of early childhood  and at  the sight of the poor little fellow  rougemont  the frightful  slaughter place  with its daily massacre of the innocents  arose in his  memory  such as it had been described to him in years long past   there was la loiseau  whose habits were so abominably filthy that her  nurslings rotted as on a manure heap  there was la vimeux  who never  purchased a drop of milk  but picked up all the village crusts and made  bran porridge for her charges as if they had been pigs  there was la  gavette too  who  being always in the fields  left her nurslings in  the charge of a paralytic old man  who sometimes let them fall into the  fire  and there was la cauchois  who  having nobody to watch the babes   contented herself with tying them in their cradles  leaving them in  the company of fowls which came in bands to peck at their eyes  and the  scythe of death swept by  there was wholesale assassination  doors were  left wide open before rows of cradles  in order to make room for fresh  bundles despatched from paris  yet all did not die  here  for instance   was one brought home again  but even when they came back alive they  carried with them the germs of death  and another hecatomb ensued   another sacrifice to the monstrous god of social egotism      i m tired out  i must sit down   resumed la couteau  seating herself  on the narrow bench behind the counter   ah  what a trade  and to  think that we are always received as if we were heartless criminals and  thieves      she also had become withered  her sunburnt  tanned face suggesting more  than ever the beak of a bird of prey  but her eyes remained very keen   sharpened as it were by ferocity  she no doubt failed to get rich fast  enough  for she continued wailing  complaining of her calling  of the  increasing avarice of parents  of the demands of the authorities  of the  warfare which was being declared against nurse agents on all sides  yes   it was a lost calling  said she  and really god must have abandoned her  that she should still be compelled to carry it on at forty five years  of age   it will end by killing me   she added   i shall always get more  kicks than money at it  how unjust it is  here have i brought you back  a superb child  and yet you look anything but pleased  it s enough to  disgust one of doing one s best      in thus complaining her object perhaps was to extract from the  haberdasher as large a present as possible  madame menoux was certainly  disturbed by it all  her boy woke up and began to wail loudly  and it  became necessary to give him a little lukewarm milk  at last  when the  accounts were settled  the nurse agent  seeing that she would have ten  francs for herself  grew calmer  she was about to take her leave when  madame menoux  pointing to mathieu  exclaimed   this gentleman wished to  speak to you on business      although la couteau had not seen the gentleman for several years past   she had recognized him perfectly well  still she had not even turned  towards him  for she knew him to be mixed up in so many matters that his  discretion was a certainty  and so she contented herself with saying    if monsieur will kindly explain to me what it is i shall be quite at  his service       i will accompany you   replied mathieu   we can speak together as we  walk along       very good  that will suit me well  for i am rather in a hurry      once outside  mathieu resolved that he would try no ruses with her  the  best course was to tell her plainly what he wanted  and then to buy  her silence  at the first words he spoke she understood him  she well  remembered norine s child  although in her time she had carried dozens  of children to the foundling hospital  the particular circumstances of  that case  however  the conversation which had taken place  her  drive with mathieu in a cab  had all remained engraved on her memory   moreover  she had found that child again  at rougemont  five days later   and she even remembered that her friend the hospital attendant had  left it with la loiseau  but she had occupied herself no more about it  afterwards  and she believed that it was now dead  like so many others   when she heard mathieu speak of the hamlet of saint pierre  of montoir  the wheelwright  and of alexandre honore  now fifteen  who must be in  apprenticeship there  she evinced great surprise      oh  you must be mistaken  monsieur   she said   i know montoir at  saint pierre very well  and he certainly has a lad from the foundling   of the age you mention  at his place  but that lad came from la  cauchois  he is a big carroty fellow named richard  who arrived at our  village some days before the other  i know who his mother was  she  was an english woman called amy  who stopped more than once at madame  bourdieu s  that ginger haired lad is certainly not your norine s boy   alexandre honore was dark       well  then   replied mathieu   there must be another apprentice at the  wheelwright s  my information is precise  it was given me officially      after a moment s perplexity la couteau made a gesture of ignorance   and admitted that mathieu might be right   it s possible   said she    perhaps montoir has two apprentices  he does a good business  and as  i haven t been to saint pierre for some months now i can say nothing  certain  well  and what do you desire of me  monsieur      he then gave her very clear instructions  she was to obtain the most  precise information possible about the lad s health  disposition  and  conduct  whether the schoolmaster had always been pleased with him   whether his employer was equally satisfied  and so forth  briefly  the  inquiry was to be complete  but  above all things  she was to carry it  on in such a way that nobody should suspect anything  neither the boy  himself nor the folks of the district  there must be absolute secrecy      all that is easy   replied la couteau   i understand perfectly  and you  can rely on me  i shall need a little time  however  and the best plan  will be for me to tell you of the result of my researches when i next  come to paris  and if it suits you you will find me to day fortnight  at  two o clock  at broquette s office in the rue roquepine  i am quite at  home there  and the place is like a tomb      some days later  as mathieu was again at the beauchene works with his  son blaise  he was observed by constance  who called him to her and  questioned him in such direct fashion that he had to tell her what steps  he had taken  when she heard of his appointment with la couteau for  the wednesday of the ensuing week  she said to him in her resolute way    come and fetch me  i wish to question that woman myself  i want to be  quite certain on the matter      in spite of the lapse of fifteen years broquette s nurse office in the  rue roquepine had remained the same as formerly  except that madame  broquette was dead and had been succeeded by her daughter herminie   the sudden loss of that fair  dignified lady  who had possessed such  a decorative presence and so ably represented the high morality and  respectability of the establishment  had at first seemed a severe one   but it so happened that herminie  a tall  slim  languid creature  that she was  gorged with novel reading  also proved in her way a  distinguished figurehead for the office  she was already thirty and was  still unmarried  feeling indeed nothing but loathing for all the mothers  laden with whining children by whom she was surrounded  moreover  m   broquette  her father  though now more than five and seventy  secretly  remained the all powerful  energetic director of the place  discharging  all needful police duties  drilling new nurses like recruits  remaining  ever on the watch and incessantly perambulating the three floors of his  suspicious  dingy lodging house     la couteau was waiting for mathieu in the doorway  on perceiving  constance  whom she did not know  for she had never previously met her   she seemed surprised  who could that lady be  what had she to do with  the affair  however  she promptly extinguished the bright gleam of  curiosity which for a moment lighted up her eyes  and as herminie  with  distinguished nonchalance  was at that moment exhibiting a party of  nurses to two gentlemen in the office  she took her visitors into the  empty refectory  where the atmosphere was as usual tainted by a horrible  stench of cookery      you must excuse me  monsieur and madame   she exclaimed   but there is  no other room free just now  the place is full      then she carried her keen glances from mathieu to constance  preferring  to wait until she was questioned  since another person was now in the  secret      you can speak out   said mathieu   did you make the inquiries i spoke  to you about       certainly  monsieur  they were made  and properly made  i think       then tell us the result  i repeat that you can speak freely before this  lady       oh  monsieur  it won t take me long  you were quite right  there were  two apprentices at the wheelwright s at saint pierre  and one of them  was alexandre honore  the pretty blonde s child  the same that we took  together over yonder  he had been there  i found  barely two months   after trying three or four other callings  and that explains my  ignorance of the circumstance  only he s a lad who can stay nowhere  and  so three weeks ago he took himself off      constance could not restrain an exclamation of anxiety   what  took  himself off       yes  madame  i mean that he ran away  and this time it is quite certain  that he has left the district  for he disappeared with three hundred  francs belonging to montoir  his master      la couteau s dry voice rang as if it were an axe dealing a deadly  blow  although she could not understand the lady s sudden pallor and  despairing emotion  she certainly seemed to derive cruel enjoyment from  it      are you quite sure of your information   resumed constance  struggling  against the facts   that is perhaps mere village tittle tattle       tittle tattle  madame  oh  when i undertake to do anything i do  it properly  i spoke to the gendarmes  they have scoured the whole  district  and it is certain that alexandre honore left no address behind  him when he went off with those three hundred francs  he is still on the  run  as for that i ll stake my name on it      this was indeed a hard blow for constance  that lad  whom she fancied  she had found again  of whom she dreamt incessantly  and on whom she had  based so many unacknowledgable plans of vengeance  escaped her  vanished  once more into the unknown  she was distracted by it as by some  pitiless stroke of fate  some fresh and irreparable defeat  however  she  continued the interrogatory      surely you did not merely see the gendarmes  you were instructed to  question everybody       that is precisely what i did  madame  i saw the schoolmaster  and i  spoke to the other persons who had employed the lad  they all told me  that he was a good for nothing  the schoolmaster remembered that he had  been a liar and a bully  now he s a thief  that makes him perfect  i  can t say otherwise than i have said  since you wanted to know the plain  truth      la couteau thus emphasized her statements on seeing that the lady s  suffering increased  and what strange suffering it was  a heart pang at  each fresh accusation  as if her husband s illegitimate child had become  in some degree her own  she ended indeed by silencing the nurse agent      thank you  the boy is no longer at rougemont  that is all we wished to  know      la couteau thereupon turned to mathieu  continuing her narrative  in  order to give him his money s worth      i also made the other apprentice talk a bit   said she   you know  that  big carroty fellow  richard  whom i spoke to you about  he s another  whom i wouldn t willingly trust  but it s certain that he doesn t know  where his companion has gone  the gendarmes think that alexandre is in  paris      thereupon mathieu in his turn thanked the woman  and handed her a  bank note for fifty francs  a gift which brought a smile to her face  and rendered her obsequious  and  as she herself put it   as discreetly  silent as the grave   then  as three nurses came into the refectory   and monsieur broquette could be heard scrubbing another s hands in the  kitchen  by way of teaching her how to cleanse herself of her native  dirt  constance felt nausea arise within her  and made haste to follow  her companion away  once in the street  instead of entering the cab  which was waiting  she paused pensively  haunted by la couteau s final  words      did you hear   she exclaimed   that wretched lad may be in paris       that is probable enough  they all end by stranding here      constance again hesitated  reflected  and finally made up her mind to  say in a somewhat tremulous voice   and the mother  my friend  you know  where she lives  don t you  did you not tell me that you had concerned  yourself about her       yes  i did       then listen  and above all  don t be astonished  pity me  for i am  really suffering  an idea has just taken possession of me  it seems to  me that if the boy is in paris  he may have found his mother  perhaps he  is with her  or she may at least know where he lodges  oh  don t tell me  that it is impossible  on the contrary  everything is possible      surprised and moved at seeing one who usually evinced so much calmness  now giving way to such fancies as these  mathieu promised that he would  make inquiries  nevertheless  constance did not get into the cab  but  continued gazing at the pavement  and when she once more raised her  eyes  she spoke to him entreatingly  in an embarrassed  humble manner    do you know what we ought to do  excuse me  but it is a service i shall  never forget  if i could only know the truth at once it might calm me a  little  well  let us drive to that woman s now  oh  i won t go up  you  can go alone  while i wait in the cab at the street corner  and perhaps  you will obtain some news      it was an insane idea  and he was at first minded to prove this to her   then  on looking at her  she seemed to him so wretched  so painfully  tortured  that without a word  making indeed but a kindly gesture of  compassion  he consented  and the cab carried them away     the large room in which norine and cecile lived together was at  grenelle  near the champ de mars  in a street at the end of the rue de  la federation  they had been there for nearly six years now  and in the  earlier days had experienced much worry and wretchedness  but the child  whom they had to feed and save had on his side saved them also  the  motherly feelings slumbering in norine s heart had awakened with  passionate intensity for that poor little one as soon as she had given  him the breast and learnt to watch over him and kiss him  and it was  also wondrous to see how that unfortunate creature cecile regarded  the child as in some degree her own  he had indeed two mothers  whose  thoughts were for him alone  if norine  during the first few months  had  often wearied of spending her days in pasting little boxes together  if  even thoughts of flight had at times come to her  she had always been  restrained by the puny arms that were clasped around her neck  and now  she had grown calm  sensible  diligent  and very expert at the light  work which cecile had taught her  it was a sight to see them both  gay  and closely united in their little home  which was like a convent cell   spending their days at their little table  while between them was their  child  their one source of life  of hard working courage and happiness     since they had been living thus they had made but one good friend   and this was madame angelin  as a delegate of the poor relief service   intrusted with one of the grenelle districts  madame angelin had found  norine among the pensioners over whom she was appointed to watch  a  feeling of affection for the two mothers  as she called the sisters  had  sprung up within her  and she had succeeded in inducing the authorities  to prolong the child s allowance of thirty francs a month for a period  of three years  then she had obtained scholastic assistance for him  not  to mention frequent presents which she brought  clothes  linen  and  even money  for apart from official matters  charitable people often  intrusted her with fairly large sums  which she distributed among the  most meritorious of the poor mothers whom she visited  and even nowadays  she occasionally called on the sisters  well pleased to spend an hour  in that nook of quiet toil  which the laughter and the play of the child  enlivened  she there felt herself to be far away from the world  and  suffered less from her own misfortunes  and norine kissed her hands   declaring that without her the little household of the two mothers would  never have managed to exist     when mathieu appeared there  cries of delight arose  he also was a  friend  a saviour  the one who  by first taking and furnishing the  large room  had founded the household  it was a very clean room  almost  coquettish with its white curtains  and rendered very cheerful by its  two large windows  which admitted the golden radiance of the afternoon  sun  norine and cecile were working at the table  cutting out cardboard  and pasting it together  while the little one  who had come home from  school  sat between them on a high chair  gravely handling a pair of  scissors and fully persuaded that he was helping them      oh  is it you  how kind of you to come to see us  nobody has called  for five days past  oh  we don t complain of it  we are so happy alone  together  since irma married a clerk she has treated us with disdain   euphrasie can no longer come down her stairs  victor and his wife live  so far away  and as for that rascal alfred  he only comes up here to see  if he can find something to steal  mamma called five days ago to tell us  that papa had narrowly escaped being killed at the works on the previous  day  poor mamma  she is so worn out that before long she won t be able  to take a step      while the sisters thus rattled on both together  one beginning a  sentence and the other finishing it  mathieu looked at norine   who  thanks to that peaceful and regular life  had regained in her  thirty sixth year a freshness of complexion that suggested a superb   mature fruit gilded by the sun  and even the slender cecile had acquired  strength  the strength which love s energy can impart even to a childish  form     all at once  however  she raised a loud exclamation of horror   oh  he  has hurt himself  the poor little fellow   and at once she snatched the  scissors from the child  who sat there laughing with a drop of blood at  the tip of one of his fingers      oh  good heavens   murmured norine  who had turned quite pale   i  feared that he had slit his hand      for a moment mathieu wondered if he would serve any useful purpose by  fulfilling the strange mission he had undertaken  then it seemed to him  that it might be as well to say at least a word of warning to the young  woman who had grown so calm and quiet  thanks to the life of work  which she had at last embraced  and he proceeded very prudently  only  revealing the truth by slow degrees  nevertheless  there came a moment  when  after reminding norine of the birth of alexandre honore  it became  necessary for him to add that the boy was living     the mother looked at mathieu in evident consternation   he is living   living  why do you tell me that  i was so pleased at knowing nothing       no doubt  but it is best that you should know  i have even been assured  that he must now be in paris  and i wondered whether he might have found  you  and have come to see you      at this she lost all self possession   what  have come to see me  nobody  has been to see me  do you think  then  that he might come  but i don t  want him to do so  i should go mad  a big fellow of fifteen falling on  me like that  a lad i don t know and don t care for  oh  no  no  prevent  it  i beg of you  i couldn t  i couldn t bear it      with a gesture of utter distraction she had burst into tears  and had  caught hold of the little one near her  pressing him to her breast as if  to shield him from the other  the unknown son  the stranger  who by his  resurrection threatened to thrust himself in some degree in the younger  lad s place      no  no   she cried   i have but one child  there is only one i love  i  don t want any other      cecile had risen  greatly moved  and desirous of bringing her sister to  reason  supposing that the other son should come  how could she turn  him out of doors  at the same time  though her pity was aroused for the  abandoned one  she also began to bewail the loss of their happiness   it became necessary for mathieu to reassure them both by saying that he  regarded such a visit as most improbable  without telling them the exact  truth  he spoke of the elder lad s disappearance  adding  however  that  he must be ignorant even of his mother s name  thus  when he left the  sisters  they already felt relieved and had again turned to their little  boxes while smiling at their son  to whom they had once more intrusted  the scissors in order that he might cut out some paper men     down below  at the street corner  constance  in great impatience  was  looking out of the cab window  watching the house door      well   she asked  quivering  as soon as mathieu was near her      well  the mother knows nothing and has seen nobody  it was a foregone  conclusion      she sank down as if from some supreme collapse  and her ashen face  became quite distorted   you are right  it was certain   said she    still one always hopes   and with a gesture of despair she added   it  is all ended now  everything fails me  my last dream is dead      mathieu pressed her hand and remained waiting for her to give an address  in order that he might transmit it to the driver  but she seemed to have  lost her head and to have forgotten where she wished to go  then  as she  asked him if he would like her to set him down anywhere  he replied  that he wished to call on the seguins  the fear of finding herself alone  again so soon after the blow which had fallen on her thereupon gave her  the idea of paying a visit to valentine  whom she had not seen for some  time past      get in   she said to mathieu   we will go to the avenue d antin  together      the vehicle rolled off and heavy silence fell between them  they had  not a word to say to one another  however  as they were reaching their  destination  constance exclaimed in a bitter voice   you must give my  husband the good news  and tell him that the boy has disappeared  ah   what a relief for him      mathieu  on calling in the avenue d antin  had hoped to find the seguins  assembled there  seguin himself had returned to paris  nobody knew  whence  a week previously  when andree s hand had been formally asked  of him  and after an interview with his uncle du hordel he had evinced  great willingness and cordiality  indeed  the wedding had immediately  been fixed for the month of may  when the froments also hoped to marry  off their daughter rose  the two weddings  it was thought  might take  place at chantebled on the same day  which would be delightful  this  being arranged  ambroise was accepted as fiance  and to his great  delight was able to call at the seguins  every day  about five o clock   to pay his court according to established usage  it was on account of  this that mathieu fully expected to find the whole family at home     when constance asked for valentine  however  a footman informed her that  madame had gone out  and when mathieu in his turn asked for seguin  the  man replied that monsieur was also absent  only mademoiselle was at home  with her betrothed  on learning this the visitors went upstairs      what  are you left all alone   exclaimed mathieu on perceiving the  young couple seated side by side on a little couch in the big room on  the first floor  which seguin had once called his  cabinet       why  yes  we are alone in the house   andree answered with a charming  laugh   we are very pleased at it      they looked adorable  thus seated side by side  she so gentle  of such  tender beauty  he with all the fascinating charm that was blended with  his strength      isn t celeste there at any rate   again inquired mathieu      no  she has disappeared we don t know where   and again they laughed  like free frolicsome birds ensconced in the depths of some lonely  forest      well  you cannot be very lively all alone like this       oh  we don t feel at all bored  we have so many things to talk about   and then we look at one another  and there is never an end to it all      though her heart bled  constance could not help admiring them  ah  to  think of it  such grace  such health  such hope  while in her home all  was blighted  withered  destroyed  that race of froments seemed destined  to increase forever  for this again was a conquest  those two children  left free to love one another  henceforth alone in that sumptuous  mansion which to morrow would belong to them  then  at another thought   constance turned towards mathieu   are you not also marrying your eldest  daughter   she asked      yes  rose   mathieu gayly responded   we shall have a grand fete at  chantebled next may  you must all of you come there       twas indeed as she had thought  numbers prevailed  life proved  victorious  chantebled had been conquered from the seguins  and now  their very house would soon be invaded by ambroise  while the beauchene  works themselves had already half fallen into the hands of blaise      we will go   she answered  quivering   and may your good luck  continue  that is what i wish you            xvi    amid the general delight attending the double wedding which was to  prove  so to say  a supreme celebration of the glory of chantebled   it had occurred to mathieu s daughter rose to gather the whole family  together one sunday  ten days before the date appointed for the  ceremony  she and her betrothed  followed by the whole family  were to  repair to janville station in the morning to meet the other affianced  pair  ambroise and andree  who were to be conducted in triumph to the  farm where they would all lunch together  it would be a kind of wedding  rehearsal  she exclaimed with her hearty laugh  they would be able to  arrange the programme for the great day  and her idea enraptured her  to such a point  she seemed to anticipate so much delight from this  preliminary festival  that mathieu and marianne consented to it     rose s marriage was like the supreme blossoming of years of prosperity   and brought a finishing touch to the happiness of the home  she was the  prettiest of mathieu s daughters  with dark brown hair  round gilded  cheeks  merry eyes  and charming mouth  and she had the most equable of  dispositions  her laughter ever rang out so heartily  she seemed indeed  to be the very soul  the good fairy  of that farm teeming with busy  life  but beneath the invariable good humor which kept her singing from  morning till night there was much common sense and energy of affection   as her choice of a husband showed  eight years previously mathieu had  engaged the services of one frederic berthaud  the son of a petty farmer  of the neighborhood  this sturdy young fellow had taken a passionate  interest in the creative work of chantebled  learning and working there  with rare activity and intelligence  he had no means of his own at all   rose  who had grown up near him  knew however that he was her father s  preferred assistant  and when he returned to the farm at the expiration  of his military service she  divining that he loved her  forced him  to acknowledge it  thus she settled her own future life  she wished to  remain near her parents  on that farm which had hitherto held all her  happiness  neither mathieu nor marianne was surprised at this  deeply  touched  they signified their approval of a choice in which affection  for themselves had so large a part  the family ties seemed to be drawn  yet closer  and increase of joy came to the home     so everything was settled  and it was agreed that on the appointed  sunday ambroise should bring his betrothed andree and her mother   madame seguin  to janville by the ten o clock train  a couple of hours  previously rose had already begun a battle with the object of prevailing  upon the whole family to repair to the railway station to meet the  affianced pair      but come  my children  it is unreasonable   marianne gently exclaimed    it is necessary that somebody should stay at home  i shall keep nicolas  here  for there is no need to send children of five years old scouring  the roads  i shall also keep gervais and claire  but you may take all  the others if you like  and your father shall lead the way      rose  however  still merrily laughing  clung to her plan   no  no   mamma  you must come as well  everybody must come  it was promised   ambroise and andree  you see  are like a royal couple from a neighboring  kingdom  my brother ambroise  having won the hand of a foreign princess   is going to present her to us  and so  to do them the honors of our own  empire  we  frederic and i  must go to meet them  attended by the whole  court  you form the court and you cannot do otherwise than come  ah what  a fine sight it will be when we spread out through the country on our  way home again      marianne  amused by her daughter s overflowing gayety  ended by laughing  and giving way      this will be the order of the march   resumed rose   oh  i ve planned  everything  as you will see  as for frederic and myself  we shall go on  our bicycles  that is the most modern style  we will also take my maids  of honor  my little sisters louise  madeleine  and marguerite  eleven   nine  and seven years old  on their bicycles  they will look very well  behind me  then gregoire can follow on his wheel  he is thirteen  and  will do as a page  bringing up the rear of my personal escort  all the  rest of the court will have to pack itself into the chariot  i mean  the big family wagon  in which there is room for eight  you  as queen  mother  may keep your last little prince  nicolas  on your knees   papa will only have to carry himself proudly  as befits the head of a  dynasty  and my brother gervais  that young hercules of seventeen  shall  drive  with claire  who at fifteen is so remarkable for common sense   beside him on the box seat  as for the illustrious twins  those high and  mighty lords  denis and blaise  we will call for them at janville  since  they are waiting for us there  at madame desvignes       thus did rose rattle on  exulting over the scheme she had devised   she danced  sang  clapped her hands  and finally exclaimed   ah  for a  pretty cortege this will be fine indeed      she was animated by such joyous haste that she made the party start much  sooner than was necessary  and they reached janville at half past nine   it was true  however  that they had to call for the others there  the  house in which madame desvignes had taken refuge after her husband s  death  and which she had now occupied for some twelve years  living  there in a very quiet retired way on the scanty income she had managed  to save  was the first in the village  on the high road  for a week past  her elder daughter charlotte  blaise s wife  had come to stay there with  her children  berthe and christophe  who needed change of air  and  on the previous evening they had been joined by blaise  who was well  pleased to spend sunday with them     madame desvignes  younger daughter  marthe  was delighted whenever her  sister thus came to spend a few weeks in the old home  bringing her  little ones with her  and once more occupying the room which had  belonged to her in her girlish days  all the laughter and playfulness of  the past came back again  and the one dream of worthy madame desvignes   amid her pride at being a grandmamma  was of completing her life work   hitherto so prudently carried on  by marrying off marthe in her turn  as  a matter of fact it had seemed likely that there might be three instead  of two weddings at chantebled that spring  denis  who  since leaving a  scientific school had embarked in fresh technical studies  often slept  at the farm and nearly every sunday he saw marthe  who was of the same  age as rose and her constant companion  the young girl  a pretty blonde  like her sister charlotte  but of a less impulsive and more practical  nature  had indeed attracted denis  and  dowerless though she was  he  had made up his mind to marry her  since he had discovered that she  possessed the sterling qualities that help one on to fortune  but in  their chats together both evinced good sense and serene confidence   without sign of undue haste  particularly was this the case with denis   who was very methodical in his ways and unwilling to place a woman s  happiness in question until he could offer her an assured position   thus  of their own accord  they had postponed their marriage  quietly  and smilingly resisting the passionate assaults of rose  whom the idea  of three weddings on the same day had greatly excited  at the same time   denis continued visiting madame desvignes  who  on her side  equally  prudent and confident  received him much as if he were her son  that  morning he had even quitted the farm at seven o clock  saying that  he meant to surprise blaise in bed  and thus he also was to be met at  janville     as it happened  the fete of janville fell on sunday  the second in  may  encompassing the square in front of the railway station were  roundabouts  booths  shooting galleries  and refreshment stalls  stormy  showers during the night had cleansed the sky  which was of a pure blue   with a flaming sun  whose heat in fact was excessive for the season  a  good many people were already assembled on the square  all the idlers  of the district  bands of children  and peasants of the surrounding  country  eager to see the sights  and into the midst of this crowd fell  the froments  first the bicyclists  next the wagon  and then the others  who had been met at the entry of the village      we are producing our little effect   exclaimed rose as she sprang from  her wheel     this was incontestable  during the earlier years the whole of janville  had looked harshly on those froments  those bourgeois who had come  nobody knew whence  and who  with overweening conceit  had talked of  making corn grow in land where there had been nothing but crops of  stones for centuries past  then the miracle  mathieu s extraordinary  victory  had long hurt people s vanity and thereby increased their  anger  but everything passes away  one cannot regard success with  rancor  and folks who grow rich always end by being in the right  thus   nowadays  janville smiled complacently on that swarming family which had  grown up beside it  forgetting that in former times each fresh birth  at chantebled had been regarded as quite scandalous by the gossips   besides  how could one resist such a happy display of strength and  power  such a merry invasion  when  as on that festive sunday  the whole  family came up at a gallop  conquering the roads  the streets  and the  squares  what with the father and mother  the eleven children  six boys  and five girls  and two grandchildren already  there were fifteen of  them  the eldest boys  the twins  were now four and twenty  and still  so much alike that people occasionally mistook one for the other as in  their cradle days  when marianne had been obliged to open their eyes  to identify them  those of blaise being gray  and those of denis black   nicolas  the youngest boy  at the other end of the family scale  was as  yet but five years old  a delightful little urchin was he  a precocious  little man whose energy and courage were quite amusing  and between the  twins and that youngster came the eight other children  ambroise  the  future husband  who was already on the road to every conquest  rose  so  brimful of life  who likewise was on the eve of marrying  gervais  with  his square brow and wrestler s limbs  who would soon be fighting the  good fight of agriculture  claire  who was silent and hardworking  and  lacked beauty  but possessed a strong heart and a housewife s sensible  head  next gregoire  the undisciplined  self willed schoolboy  who was  ever beating the hedges in search of adventures  and then the three last  girls  louise  plump and good natured  madeleine  delicate and of dreamy  mind  marguerite  the least pretty but the most loving of the trio  and  when  behind their father and their mother  the eleven came along one  after the other  followed too by berthe and christophe  representing  yet another generation  it was a real procession that one saw  as  for  instance  on that fine sunday on the grand place of janville  already  crowded with holiday making folks  and the effect was irresistible   even those who were scarcely pleased with the prodigious success of  chantebled felt enlivened and amused at seeing the froments galloping  about and invading the place  so much health and mirth and strength  accompanied them  as if earth with her overflowing gifts of life had  thus profusely created them for to morrow s everlasting hopes      let those who think themselves more numerous come forward   rose  resumed gayly   and then we will count one another       come  be quiet   said her mother  who  after alighting from the wagon   had set nicolas on the ground   you will end by making people hoot us       hoot us  why  they admire us  just look at them  how funny it is   mamma  that you are not prouder of yourself and of us       why  i am so very proud that i fear to humiliate others      they all began to laugh  and mathieu  standing near marianne  likewise  felt proud at finding himself  as he put it  among  the sacred  battalion  of his sons and daughters  to that battalion worthy madame  desvignes herself belonged  since her daughter charlotte was adding  soldiers to it and helping it to become an army  such as it was indeed   this was only the beginning  later on the battalion would be seen  ever increasing and multiplying  becoming a swarming victorious race   great grandchildren following grandchildren  till there were fifty  of them  and a hundred  and two hundred  all tending to increase the  happiness and beauty of the world  and in the mingled amazement and  amusement of janville gathered around that fruitful family there was  certainly some of the instinctive admiration which is felt for the  strength and the healthfulness which create great nations      besides  we have only friends now   remarked mathieu   everybody is  cordial with us       oh  everybody   muttered rose   just look at the lepailleurs yonder  in  front of that booth      the lepailleurs were indeed there  the father  the mother  antonin  and  therese  in order to avoid the froments they were pretending to take  great interest in a booth  where a number of crudely colored china  ornaments were displayed as prizes for the winners at a  lucky wheel    they no longer even exchanged courtesies with the chantebled folks  for  in their impotent rage at such ceaseless prosperity they had availed  themselves of a petty business dispute to break off all relations   lepailleur regarded the creation of chantebled as a personal insult   for he had not forgotten his jeers and challenges with respect to those  moorlands  from which  in his opinion  one would never reap anything  but stones  and thus  when he had well examined the china ornaments  it  occurred to him to be insolent  with which object he turned round and  stared at the froments  who  as the train they were expecting would not  arrive for another quarter of an hour  were gayly promenading through  the fair     the miller s bad temper had for the last two months been increased  by the return of his son antonin to janville under very deplorable  circumstances  this young fellow  who had set off one morning to conquer  paris  sent there by his parents  who had a blind confidence in his fine  handwriting  had remained with maitre rousselet the attorney for four  years as a petty clerk  dull witted and extremely idle  he had not made  the slightest progress in his profession  but had gradually sunk into  debauchery  cafe life  drunkenness  gambling  and facile amours  to him  the conquest of paris meant greedy indulgence in the coarsest pleasures  such as he had dreamt of in his village  it consumed all his money  all  the supplies which he extracted from his mother by continual promises  of victory  in which she implicitly believed  so great was her faith  in him  but he ended by grievously suffering in health  turned thin and  yellow  and actually began to lose his hair at three and twenty  so that  his mother  full of alarm  brought him home one day  declaring that he  worked too hard  and that she would not allow him to kill himself in  that fashion  it leaked out  however  later on  that maitre rousselet  had summarily dismissed him  even before this was known his return home  did not fail to make his father growl  the miller partially guessed  the truth  and if he did not openly vent his anger  it was solely from  pride  in order that he might not have to confess his mistake with  respect to the brilliant career which he had predicted for antonin  at  home  when the doors were closed  lepailleur revenged himself on  his wife  picking the most frightful quarrels with her since he had  discovered her frequent remittances of money to their son  but she held  her own against him  for even as she had formerly admired him  so at  present she admired her boy  she sacrificed  as it were  the father to  the son  now that the latter s greater learning brought her increased  surprise  and so the household was all disagreement as a result of  that foolish attempt  born of vanity  to make their heir a monsieur  a  parisian  antonin for his part sneered and shrugged his shoulders at  it all  idling away his time pending the day when he might be able to  resume a life of profligacy     when the froments passed by  it was a fine sight to see the lepailleurs  standing there stiffly and devouring them with their eyes  the father  puckered his lips in an attempt to sneer  and the mother jerked her head  with an air of bravado  the son  standing there with his hands in his  pockets  presented a sorry sight with his bent back  his bald head  and  pale face  all three were seeking to devise something disagreeable when  an opportunity presented itself      why  where is therese   exclaimed la lepailleur   she was here just  now  what has become of her  i won t have her leave me when there are  all these people about      it was quite true  for the last moment therese had disappeared  she was  now ten years old and very pretty  quite a plump little blonde  with  wild hair and black eyes which shone brightly  but she had a terribly  impulsive and wilful nature  and would run off and disappear for hours  at a time  beating the hedges and scouring the countryside in search of  birds  nests and flowers and wild fruit  if her mother  however  made  such a display of alarm  darting hither and thither to find her  just  as the froments passed by  it was because she had become aware of some  scandalous proceedings during the previous week  therese s ardent dream  was to possess a bicycle  and she desired one the more since her parents  stubbornly refused to content her  declaring in fact that those machines  might do for bourgeois but were certainly not fit for well behaved  girls  well  one afternoon  when she had gone as usual into the fields   her mother  returning from market  had perceived her on a deserted strip  of road  in company with little gregoire froment  another young wanderer  whom she often met in this wise  in spots known only to themselves  the  two made a very suitable pair  and were ever larking and rambling along  the paths  under the leaves  beside the ditches  but the abominable  thing was that  on this occasion  gregoire  having seated therese on  his own bicycle  was supporting her at the waist and running alongside   helping her to direct the machine  briefly it was a real bicycle lesson  which the little rascal was giving  and which the little hussy took with  all the pleasure in the world  when therese returned home that evening  she had her ears soundly boxed for her pains      where can that little gadabout have got to   la lepailleur continued  shouting   one can no sooner take one s eyes off her than she runs  away      antonin  however  having peeped behind the booth containing the china  ornaments  lurched back again  still with his hands in his pockets  and  said with his vicious sneer   just look there  you ll see something      and indeed  behind the booth  his mother again found therese and  gregoire together  the lad was holding his bicycle with one hand  and explaining some of the mechanism of it  while the girl  full of  admiration and covetousness  looked on with glowing eyes  indeed she  could not resist her inclination  but laughingly let gregoire raise her  in order to seat her for a moment on the saddle  when all at once her  mother s terrible voice burst forth   you wicked hussy  what are you up  to there again  just come back at once  or i ll settle your business for  you      then mathieu also  catching sight of the scene  sternly summoned  gregoire   please to place your wheel with the others  you know what i  have already said to you  so don t begin again      it was war  lepailleur impudently growled ignoble threats  which  fortunately were lost amid the strains of a barrel organ  and the  two families separated  going off in different directions through the  growing holiday making crowd      won t that train ever come  then   resumed rose  who with joyous  impatience was at every moment turning to glance at the clock of the  little railway station on the other side of the square   we have still  ten minutes to wait  whatever shall we do      as it happened she had stopped in front of a hawker who stood on the  footway with a basketful of crawfish  crawling  pell mell  at his feet   they had certainly come from the sources of the yeuse  three leagues  away  they were not large  but they were very tasty  for rose herself  had occasionally caught some in the stream  and thus a greedy but also  playful fancy came to her      oh  mamma   she cried   let us buy the whole basketful  it will be  for the feast of welcome  you see  it will be our present to the royal  couple we are awaiting  people won t say that our majesties neglect to  do things properly when they are expecting other majesties  and i will  cook them when we get back  and you ll see how well i shall succeed      at this the others began to poke fun at her  but her parents ended by  doing as she asked  big child as she was  who in the fulness of her  happiness hardly knew what amusement to seek  however  as by way of  pastime she obstinately sought to count the crawfish  quite an affair  ensued  some of them pinched her  and she dropped them with a little  shriek  and  amid it all  the basket fell over and then the crawfish  hurriedly crawled away  the boys and girls darted in pursuit of them   there was quite a hunt  in which even the serious members of the family  at last took part  and what with the laughter and eagerness of one and  all  the big as well as the little  the whole happy brood  the sight  was so droll and gay that the folks of janville again drew near and  good naturedly took their share of the amusement     all at once  however  arose a distant rumble of wheels and an engine  whistled      ah  good heavens  here they are   cried rose  quite scared   quick   quick  or the reception will be missed      a scramble ensued  the owner of the crawfish was paid  and there was  just time to shut the basket and carry it to the wagon  the whole family  was already running off  invading the little station  and ranging itself  in good order along the arrival platform      no  no  not like that   rose repeated   you don t observe the right  order of precedence  the queen mother must be with the king her husband   and then the princes according to their height  frederic must place  himself on my right  and it s for me  you know  to make the speech of  welcome      the train stopped  when ambroise and andree alighted they were at first  much surprised to find that everybody had come to meet them  drawn up  in a row with solemn mien  when rose  however began to deliver a pompous  little speech  treating her brother s betrothed like some foreign  princess  whom she had orders to welcome in the name of the king  her  father  the young couple began to laugh  and even prolonged the joke by  responding in the same style  the railway men looked on and listened   gaping  it was a fine farce  and the froments were delighted at showing  themselves so playful on that warm may morning     but marianne suddenly raised an exclamation of surprise   what  has  not madame seguin come with you  she gave me so many promises that she  would      in the rear of ambroise and andree celeste the maid had alone alighted  from the train  and she undertook to explain things   madame charged  me   said she   to say that she was really most grieved  yesterday she  still hoped that she would be able to keep her promise  only in the  evening she received a visit from monsieur de navarede  who is presiding  to day  sunday  at a meeting of his society  and of course madame could  not do otherwise than attend it  so she requested me to accompany the  young people  and everything is satisfactory  for here they are  you  see      as a matter of fact nobody regretted the absence of valentine  who  always moped when she came into the country  and mathieu expressed the  general opinion in a few words of polite regret   well  you must tell  her how much we shall miss her  and now let us be off      celeste  however  intervened once more   excuse me  monsieur  but i  cannot remain with you  no  madame particularly told me to go back to  her at once  as she will need me to dress her  and  besides  she is  always bored when she is alone  there is a train for paris at a quarter  past ten  is there not  i will go back by it  then i will be here at  eight o clock this evening to take mademoiselle home  we settled all  that in looking through a time table  till this evening  monsieur       till this evening  then  it s understood      thereupon  leaving the maid in the deserted little station  all the  others returned to the village square  where the wagon and the bicycles  were waiting      now we are all assembled   exclaimed rose   and the real fete is about  to begin  let me organize the procession for our triumphal return to the  castle of our ancestors       i am very much afraid that your procession will be soaked   said  marianne   just look at the rain approaching      during the last few moments there had appeared in the hitherto spotless  sky a huge  livid cloud  rising from the west and urged along by a  sudden squall  it presaged a return of the violent stormy showers of the  previous night      rain  oh  we don t care about that   the girl responded with an air of  superb defiance   it will never dare to come down before we get home      then  with a comical semblance of authority  she disposed her people in  the order which she had planned in her mind a week previously  and the  procession set off through the admiring village  amid the smiles of all  the good women hastening to their doorsteps  and then spread out along  the white road between the fertile fields  where bands of startled  larks took wing  carrying their clear song to the heavens  it was really  magnificent     at the head of the party were rose and frederic  side by side on their  bicycles  opening the nuptial march with majestic amplitude  behind  them followed the three maids of honor  the younger sisters  louise   madeleine  and marguerite  the tallest first  the shortest last  and  each on a wheel proportioned to her growth  and with berets  on their  heads  and their hair down their backs  waving in the breeze  they  looked adorable  suggesting a flight of messenger swallows skimming over  the ground and bearing good tidings onward  as for gregoire the page   restive and always ready to bolt  he did not behave very well  for he  actually tried to pass the royal couple at the head of the procession   a proceeding which brought him various severe admonitions until he fell  back  as duty demanded  to his deferential and modest post  on the other  hand  as the three maids of honor began to sing the ballad of  cinderella on her way to the palace of prince charming  the royal couple  condescendingly declared that the song was appropriate and of pleasing  effect  whatever might be the requirements of etiquette  indeed  rose   frederic  and gregoire also ended by singing the ballad  which rang out  amid the serene  far spreading countryside like the finest music in the  world         the beret is the pyreneean tam o  shanter     then  at a short distance in the rear  came the chariot  the good  old family wagon  which was now crowded  according to the prearranged  programme it was gervais who held the ribbons  with claire beside him   the two strong horses trotted on in their usual leisurely fashion  in  spite of all the gay whip cracking of their driver  who also wished  to contribute to the music  inside there were now seven people for six  places  for if the three children were small  they were at the same time  so restless that they fully took up their share of room  first  face  to face  there were ambroise and andree  the betrothed couple who were  being honored by this glorious welcome  then  also face to face  there  were the high and mighty rulers of the region  mathieu and marianne  the  latter of whom kept little nicolas  the last prince of the line  on her  knees  he braying the while like a little donkey  because he felt so  pleased  then the last places were occupied by the rulers  granddaughter  and grandson  mademoiselle berthe and monsieur christophe  who were as  yet unable to walk long distances  and the chariot rolled on with much  majesty  albeit that for fear of the rain the curtains of stout white  linen had already been half drawn  thus giving the vehicle  at a  distance  somewhat of the aspect of a miller s van     further back yet  as a sort of rear guard  was a group on foot  composed  of blaise  denis  madame desvignes  and her daughters charlotte and  marthe  they had absolutely refused to take a fly  finding it more  pleasant to walk the mile and a half which separated chantebled from  janville  if the rain should fall  they would manage to find shelter  somewhere  besides  rose had declared that a suite on foot was  absolutely necessary to give the procession its full significance  those  five last comers would represent the multitude  the great concourse of  people which follows sovereigns and acclaims them  or else they might  be the necessary guard  the men at arms  who watched for the purpose of  foiling a possible attack from some felon neighbor  at the same time it  unfortunately happened that worthy madame desvignes could not walk very  fast  so that the rear guard was soon distanced  to such a degree indeed  that it became merely a little lost group  far away     still this did not disconcert rose  but rather made her laugh the more   at the first bend of the road she turned her head  and when she saw  her rear guard more than three hundred yards away she raised cries of  admiration   oh  just look  frederic  what an interminable procession   what a deal of room we take up  the cortege is becoming longer and  longer  and the road won t be long enough for it very soon      then  as the three maids of honor and the page began to jeer  impertinently   just try to be respectful   she said   count a little   there are six of us forming the vanguard  in the chariot there are nine   and six and nine make fifteen  add to them the five of the rear guard   and we have twenty  wherever else is such a family seen  why  the  rabbits who watch us pass are mute with stupor and humiliation      then came another laugh  and once more they all took up the song of  cinderella on her way to the palace of prince charming     it was at the bridge over the yeuse that the first drops of rain  big  drops they were  began to fall  the big livid cloud  urged on by a  terrible wind  was galloping across the sky  filling it with the clamor  of a tempest  and almost immediately afterwards the rain drops increased  in volume and in number  lashed by so violent a squall that the water  poured down as if by the bucketful  or as if some huge sluice gate had  suddenly burst asunder overhead  one could no longer see twenty yards  before one  in two minutes the road was running with water like the bed  of a torrent     then there was a  sauve qui peut  among the procession  it was learnt  later on that the people of the rear guard had luckily been surprised  near a peasant s cottage  in which they had quietly sought refuge  then  the folks in the wagon simply drew their curtains  and halted beneath  the shelter of a wayside tree for fear lest the horses should take  fright under such a downpour  they called to the bicyclists ahead of  them to stop also  instead of obstinately remaining in such a deluge   but their words were lost amid the rush of water  however  the little  girls and the page took a proper course in crouching beside a thick  hedge  though the betrothed couple wildly continued on their way     frederic  the more reasonable of the two  certainly had sense enough to  say   this isn t prudent on our part  let us stop like the others  i beg  you      but from rose  all excitement  transported by her blissful fever  and  insensible  so it seemed  to the pelting of the rain  he only drew this  answer   pooh  what does it matter  now that we are soaking  it is by  stopping that we might do ourselves harm  let us make haste  all haste   in three minutes we shall be at home and able to make fine sport of  those laggards when they arrive in another quarter of an hour      they had just crossed the yeuse bridge  and they swept on side by side   although the road was far from easy  being a continual ascent for a  thousand yards or so between rows of lofty poplars      i assure you that we are doing wrong   the young man repeated   they  will blame me  and they will be right       oh  well   cried she   i m amusing myself  this bicycle bath is quite  funny  leave me  then  if you don t love me enough to follow me      he followed her  however  pressed close beside her  and sought to  shelter her a little from the slanting rain  and it was a wild  mad race  on the part of that young couple  almost linked together  their elbows  touching as they sped on and on  as if lifted from the ground  carried  off by all that rushing  howling water which poured down so ragefully   it was as though a thunder blast bore them along  but at the very moment  when they sprang from their bicycles in the yard of the farm the rain  ceased  and the sky became blue once more     rose was laughing like a lunatic  and looked very flushed  but she was  soaked to such a point that water streamed from her clothes  her hair   her hands  you might have taken her for some fairy of the springs who  had overturned her urn on herself      well  the fete is complete   she exclaimed breathlessly   all the same   we are the first home      she then darted upstairs to comb her hair and change her gown  but to  gain just a few minutes  eager as she was to cook the crawfish  she did  not take the trouble to put on dry linen  she wished the pot to be on  the fire with the water  the white wine  the carrots and spices  before  the family arrived  and she came and went  attending to the fire and  filling the whole kitchen with her gay activity  like a good housewife  who was glad to display her accomplishments  while her betrothed  who  had also come downstairs again after changing his clothes  watched her  with a kind of religious admiration     at last  when the whole family had arrived  the folks of the brake and  the pedestrians also  there came a rather sharp explanation  mathieu  and marianne were angry  so greatly had they been alarmed by that rush  through the storm      there was no sense in it  my girl   marianne repeated   did you at  least change your linen       why yes  why yes   replied rose   where are the crawfish      mathieu meantime was lecturing frederic   you might have broken your  necks   said he   and  besides  it is by no means good to get soaked  with cold water when one is hot  you ought to have stopped her       well  she insisted on going on  and whenever she insists on anything   you know  i haven t the strength to prevent her      at last rose  in her pretty way  put an end to the reproaches   come   that s enough scolding  i did wrong  no doubt  but won t anybody  compliment me on my  court bouillon   have you ever known crawfish to  smell as nice as that      the lunch was wonderfully gay  as they were twenty  and wished to have  a real rehearsal of the wedding feast  the table had been set in a large  gallery adjoining the ordinary dining room  this gallery was still  bare  but throughout the meal they talked incessantly of how they would  embellish it with shrubs  garlands of foliage  and clumps of flowers   during the dessert they even sent for a ladder with the view of  indicating on the walls the main lines of the decorations     for a moment or so rose  previously so talkative  had lapsed into  silence  she had eaten heartily  but all the color had left her face   which had assumed a waxy pallor under her heavy hair  which was still  damp  and when she wished to ascend the ladder herself to indicate  how some ornament should be placed  her legs suddenly failed her  she  staggered  and then fainted away     everybody was in consternation  but she was promptly placed in a chair   where for a few minutes longer she remained unconscious  then  on coming  to her senses  she remained for a moment silent  oppressed as by a  feeling of pain  and apparently failing to understand what had taken  place  mathieu and marianne  terribly upset  pressed her with questions   anxious as they were to know if she felt better  she had evidently  caught cold  and this was the fine result of her foolish ride     by degrees the girl recovered her composure  and again smiled  she then  explained that she now felt no pain  but that it had suddenly seemed to  her as if a heavy paving stone were lying on her chest  then this weight  had melted away  leaving her better able to breathe  and  indeed  she  was soon on her feet once more  and finished giving her views respecting  the decoration of the gallery  in such wise that the others ended by  feeling reassured  and the afternoon passed away joyously in the making  of all sorts of splendid plans  little was eaten at dinner  for they  had done too much honor to the crawfish at noon  and at nine o clock  as  soon as celeste arrived for andree  the gathering broke up  ambroise was  returning to paris that same evening  blaise and denis were to take the  seven o clock train the following morning  and rose  after accompanying  madame desvignes and her daughters to the road  called to them through  the darkness   au revoir  come back soon   she was again full of gayety  at the thought of the general rendezvous which the family had arranged  for the approaching weddings     neither mathieu nor marianne went to bed at once  however  though they  did not even speak of it together  they thought that rose looked very  strange  as if  indeed  she were intoxicated  she had again staggered  on returning to the house  and though she only complained of some slight  oppression  they prevailed on her to go to bed  after she had retired to  her room  which adjoined their own  marianne went several times to see  if she were well wrapped up and were sleeping peacefully  while mathieu  remained anxiously thoughtful beside the lamp  at last the girl fell  asleep  and the parents  leaving the door of communication open  then  exchanged a few words in an undertone  in their desire to tranquillize  each other  it would surely be nothing  a good night s rest would  suffice to restore rose to her wonted health  then in their turn they  went to bed  the whole farm lapsed into silence  surrendering itself to  slumber until the first cockcrow  but all at once  about four o clock   shortly before daybreak  a stifled call   mamma  mamma   awoke both  mathieu and marianne  and they sprang out of bed  barefooted  shivering   and groping for the candle  rose was again stifling  struggling against  another attack of extreme violence  for the second time  however  she  soon regained consciousness and appeared relieved  and thus the parents   great as was their distress  preferred to summon nobody but to wait till  daylight  their alarm was caused particularly by the great change  they noticed in their daughter s appearance  her face was swollen and  distorted  as if some evil power had transformed her in the night  but  she fell asleep again  in a state of great prostration  and they no  longer stirred for fear of disturbing her slumber  they remained there  watching and waiting  listening to the revival of life in the farm  around them as the daylight gradually increased  time went by  five and  then six o clock struck  and at about twenty minutes to seven mathieu   on looking into the yard  and there catching sight of denis  who was to  return to paris by the seven o clock train  hastened down to tell him  to call upon boutan and beg the doctor to come at once  then  as soon as  his son had started  he rejoined marianne upstairs  still unwilling to  call or warn anybody  but a third attack followed  and this time it was  the thunderbolt     rose had half risen in bed  her arms thrown out  her mouth distended as  she gasped  mamma  mamma      then in a sudden fit of revolt  a last flash of life  she sprang from  her bed and stepped towards the window  whose panes were all aglow with  the rising sun  and for a moment she leant there  her legs bare  her  shoulders bare  and her heavy hair falling over her like a royal mantle   never had she looked more beautiful  more dazzling  full of strength and  love     but she murmured   oh  how i suffer  it is all over  i am going to die      her father darted towards her  her mother sustained her  throwing her  arms around her like invincible armor which would shield her from all  harm      don t talk like that  you unhappy girl  it is nothing  it is only  another attack which will pass away  get into bed again  for mercy s  sake  your old friend boutan is on his way here  you will be up and well  again to morrow       no  no  i am going to die  it is all over      she fell back in their arms  they only had time to lay her on her bed   and the thunderbolt fell  without a word  without a glance  in a few  minutes she died of congestion of the lungs     ah  the imbecile thunderbolt  ah  the scythe  which with a single stroke  blindly cuts down a whole springtide  it was all so brutally sudden   so utterly unexpected  that at first the stupefaction of marianne and  mathieu was greater than their despair  in response to their cries the  whole farm hastened up  the fearful news filled the place  and then all  sank into the deep silence of death  all work  all life ceasing  and the  other children were there  scared and overcome  little nicolas  who  did not yet understand things  gregoire  the page of the previous day   louise  madeleine  and marguerite  the three maids of honor  and their  elders  claire and gervais  who felt the blow more deeply  and there  were yet the others journeying away  blaise  denis  and ambroise   travelling to paris at that very moment  in ignorance of the unforeseen   frightful hatchet stroke which had fallen on the family  where would the  terrible tidings reach them  in what cruel distress would they return   and the doctor who would soon arrive too  but all at once  amid the  terror and confusion  there rang out the cries of frederic  the poor  dead girl s affianced lover  he shrieked his despair aloud  he was half  mad  he wished to kill himself  saying that he was the murderer and that  he ought to have prevented rose from so rashly riding home through  the storm  he had to be led away and watched for fear of some fresh  misfortune  his sudden frenzy had gone to every heart  sobs burst forth  and lamentations arose from the woful parents  from the brothers  the  sisters  from the whole of stricken chantebled  which death thus visited  for the first time     ah  god  rose on that bed of mourning  white  cold  and dead  she  the  fairest  the gayest  the most loved  she  before whom all the others  were ever in admiration  she of whom they were so proud  so fond  and  to think that this blow should fall in the midst of hope  bright hope in  long life and sterling happiness  but ten days before her wedding  and  on the morrow of that day of wild gayety  all jests and laughter   they could again see her  full of life and so adorable with her happy  youthful fancies  that princely reception and that royal procession   it had seemed as if those two coming weddings  celebrated the same day   would be like the supreme florescence of the family s long happiness and  prosperity  doubtless they had often experienced trouble and had even  wept at times  but they had drawn closer together and consoled  one another on such occasions  none had ever been cut off from the  good night embraces which healed every sore  and now the best was gone   death had come to say that absolute joy existed for none  that the most  valiant  the happiest  never reaped the fulness of their hopes  there  was no life without death  and they paid their share of the debt of  human wretchedness  paid it the more dearly since they had made for  themselves a larger sum of life  when everything germinates and grows  around one  when one has determined on unreserved fruitfulness  on  continuous creation and increase  how awful is the recall to the  ever present dim abyss in which the world is fashioned  on the day when  misfortune falls  digs its first pit  and carries off a loved one  it  is like a sudden snapping  a rending of the hopes which seemed to be  endless  and a feeling of stupefaction comes at the discovery that one  cannot live and love forever     ah  how terrible were the two days that followed  the farm itself  lifeless  without sound save that of the breathing of the cattle  the  whole family gathered together  overcome by the cruel spell of waiting   ever in tears while the poor corpse remained there under a harvest of  flowers  and there was this cruel aggravation  that on the eve of the  funeral  when the body had been laid in the coffin  it was brought down  into that gallery where they had lunched so merrily while discussing how  magnificently they might decorate it for the two weddings  it was there  that the last funeral watch  the last wake  took place  and there were  no evergreen shrubs  no garlands of foliage  merely four tapers which  burnt there amid a wealth of white roses gathered in the morning  but  already fading  neither the mother nor the father was willing to go  to bed that night  they remained  side by side  near the child whom  mother earth was taking back from them  they could see her quite little  again  but sixteen months old  at the time of their first sojourn at  chantebled in the old tumbledown shooting box  when she had just been  weaned and they were wont to go and cover her up at nighttime  they saw  her also  later on  in paris  hastening to them in the morning  climbing  up and pulling their bed to pieces with triumphant laughter  and they  saw her yet more clearly  growing and becoming more beautiful even as  chantebled did  as if  indeed  she herself bloomed with all the health  and beauty of that now fruitful land  yet she was no more  and whenever  the thought returned to them that they would never see her again  their  hands sought one another  met in a woful clasp  while from their crushed  and mingling hearts it seemed as if all life  all future  were flowing  away to nihility  now that a breach had been made  would not every other  happiness be carried off in turn  and though the ten other children  were there  from the little one five years old to the twins who were  four and twenty  all clad in black  all gathered in tears around their  sleeping sister  like a sorrow stricken battalion rendering funeral  honors  neither the father nor the mother saw or counted them  their  hearts were rent by the loss of the daughter who had departed  carrying  away with her some of their own flesh  and in that long bare gallery  which the four candles scarcely lighted  the dawn at last arose upon  that death watch  that last leave taking     then grief again came with the funeral procession  which spread out  along the white road between the lofty poplars and the green corn  that  road over which rose had galloped so madly through the storm  all the  relations of the froments  all their friends  all the district  had come  to pay a tribute of emotion at so sudden and swift a death  thus  this  time  the cortege did stretch far away behind the hearse  draped with  white and blooming with white roses in the bright sunshine  the whole  family was present  the mother and the sisters had declared that they  would only quit their loved one when she had been lowered into her last  resting place  and after the family came the friends  the beauchenes   the seguins  and others  but mathieu and marianne  worn out  overcome  by suffering  no longer recognized people amid their tears  they only  remembered on the morrow that they must have seen morange  if indeed it  were really morange  that silent  unobtrusive  almost shadowy gentleman   who had wept while pressing their hands  and in like fashion mathieu  fancied that  in some horrible dream  he had seen constance s spare  figure and bony profile drawing near to him in the cemetery after the  coffin had been lowered into the grave  and addressing vague words of  consolation to him  though he fancied that her eyes flashed the while as  if with abominable exultation     what was it that she had said  he no longer knew  of course her words  must have been appropriate  even as her demeanor was that of a mourning  relative  but a memory returned to him  that of other words which she  had spoken when promising to attend the two weddings  she had then in  bitter fashion expressed a wish that the good fortune of chantebled  might continue  but they  the froments  so fruitful and so prosperous   were now stricken in their turn  and their good fortune had perhaps  departed forever  mathieu shuddered  his faith in the future was shaken   he was haunted by a fear of seeing prosperity and fruitfulness vanish   now that there was that open breach           xvii    a year later the first child born to ambroise and andree  a boy  little  leonce  was christened  the young people had been married very quietly  six weeks after the death of rose  and that christening was to be the  first outing for mathieu and marianne  who had not yet fully recovered  from the terrible shock of their eldest daughter s death  moreover  it  was arranged that after the ceremony there should simply be a lunch at  the parents  home  and that one and all should afterwards be free to  return to his or her avocations  it was impossible for the whole family  to come  and  indeed  apart from the grandfather and grandmother  only  the twins  denis and blaise  and the latter s wife charlotte  were  expected  together with the godparents  beauchene  the godfather   had selected madame seguin as his  commere   for  since the death of  maurice  constance shuddered at the bare thought of touching a child   at the same time she had promised to be present at the lunch  and thus  there would be ten of them  sufficient to fill the little dining room of  the modest flat in the rue de la boetie  where the young couple resided  pending fortune s arrival     it was a very pleasant morning  although mathieu and marianne had been  unwilling to set aside their black garments even for this rejoicing   they ended by evincing some gentle gayety before the cradle of that  little grandson  whose advent brought them a renewal of hope  early in  the winter a fresh bereavement had fallen on the family  blaise had lost  his little christophe  then two and a half years old  through an attack  of croup  charlotte  however  was already at that time again  enceinte    and thus the grief of the first days had turned to expectancy fraught  with emotion     the little flat in the rue de la boetie seemed very bright and fragrant   it was perfumed by the fair grace of andree and illumined by the  victorious charm of ambroise  that handsome loving couple who  arm in  arm  had set out so bravely to conquer the world  during the lunch  too   there was the formidable appetite and jovial laughter of beauchene   who gave the greatest attention to his  commere  valentine  jesting  and paying her the most extravagant court  which afforded her much  amusement  prone as she still was to play a girlish part  though she  was already forty five and a grandmother like marianne  constance alone  remained grave  scarce condescending to bend her thin lips into a faint  smile  while a shadow of deep pain passed over her withered face every  time that she glanced round that gay table  whence new strength  based  on the invincible future  arose in spite of all the recent mourning     at about three o clock blaise rose from the table  refusing to allow  beauchene to take any more chartreuse      it s true  he is right  my children   beauchene ended by exclaiming  in a docile way   we are very comfortable here  but it is absolutely  necessary that we should return to the works  and we must deprive you  of denis  for we need his help over a big building affair  that s how we  are  we others  we don t shirk duty      constance had also risen   the carriage must be waiting   said she    will you take it       no  no  we will go on foot  a walk will clear our heads      the sky was overcast  and as it grew darker and darker ambroise  going  to the window  exclaimed   you will get wet       oh  the rain has been threatening ever since this morning  but we shall  have time to get to the works      it was then understood that constance should take charlotte with her  in the brougham and set her down at the door of the little pavilion  adjoining the factory  as for valentine  she was in no hurry and could  quietly return to the avenue d antin  which was close by  as soon as the  sky might clear  and with regard to marianne and mathieu  they had just  yielded to andree s affectionate entreaties  and had arranged to spend  the whole day and dine there  returning to chantebled by the last train   thus the fete would be complete  and the young couple were enraptured at  the prospect     the departure of the others was enlivened by a curious incident  a  mistake which constance made  and which seemed very comical amid all the  mirth promoted by the copious lunch  she had turned towards denis  and   looking at him with her pale eyes  she quietly asked him  blaise  my  friend  will you give me my boa  i must have left it in the ante room      everybody began to laugh  but she failed to understand the reason  and  it was in the same tranquil way as before that she thanked denis when  he brought her the boa   i am obliged to you  blaise  you are very  amiable      thereupon came an explosion  the others almost choked with laughter  so  droll did her quiet assurance seem to them  what was the matter  then   why did they all laugh at her in that fashion  she ended by suspecting  that she had made a mistake  and looked more attentively at the twins      ah  yes  it isn t blaise  but denis  but it can t be helped  i am  always mistaking them since they have worn their beards trimmed in the  same fashion      thereupon marianne  in her obliging way  in order to take any sting  away from the laughter  repeated the well known family story of how she  herself  when the twins were children and slept together  had been wont  to awake them in order to identify them by the different color of their  eyes  the others  beauchene and valentine  then intervened and recalled  circumstances under which they also had mistaken the twins one for the  other  so perfect was their resemblance on certain occasions  in  certain lights  and it was amid all this gay animation that the company  separated after exchanging all sorts of embraces and handshakes     once in the brougham  constance spoke but seldom to charlotte  taking  as a pretext a violent headache which the prolonged lunch had increased   with a weary air and her eyes half closed she began to reflect  after  rose s death  and when little christophe likewise had been carried off   a revival of hope had come to her  for all at once she had felt quite  young again  but when she consulted boutan on the matter he dealt her  a final blow by informing her that her hopes were quite illusive  thus   for two months now  her rage and despair had been increasing  that very  morning at that christening  and now in that carriage beside that young  woman who was again expecting to become a mother  it was this which  poisoned her mind  filled her with jealousy and spite  and rendered  her capable of any evil deed  the loss of her son  the childlessness  to which she was condemned  all threw her into a state of morbid  perversity  fraught with dreams of some monstrous vengeance which she  dared not even confess to herself  she accused the whole world of being  in league to crush her  her husband was the most cowardly and idiotic  of traitors  for he betrayed her by letting some fresh part of the works  pass day by day into the hands of that fellow blaise  whose wife no  sooner lost a child than she had another  she  constance  was enraged  also at seeing her husband so gay and happy  since she had left him  to his own base courses  he still retained his air of victorious  superiority  declaring that he had remained unchanged  and there  was truth in this  for though  instead of being an active master as  formerly  he now too often showed himself a senile prowler  on the high  road to paralysis  he yet continued to be a practical egotist  one who  drew from life the greatest sum of enjoyment possible  he was following  his destined road  and if he took to blaise it was simply because he  was delighted to have found an intelligent  hard working young man who  spared him all the cares and worries that were too heavy for his weary  shoulders  while still earning for him the money which he needed for  his pleasures  constance knew that something in the way of a partnership  arrangement was about to be concluded  indeed  her husband must have  already received a large sum to enable him to make good certain losses  and expenses which he had hidden from her  and closing her eyes as the  brougham rolled along  she poisoned her mind by ruminating all these  things  scarce able to refrain from venting her fury by throwing herself  upon that young woman charlotte  well loved and fruitful spouse  who sat  beside her     then the thought of denis occurred to her  why was he being taken to the  works  did he also mean to rob her  yet she knew that he had refused to  join his brother  as in his opinion there was not room for two at the  establishment of the boulevard de grenelle  indeed  denis s ambition  was to direct some huge works by himself  he possessed an extensive  knowledge of mechanics  and this it was that rendered him a valuable  adviser whenever a new model of some important agricultural machine had  to be prepared at the beauchene factory  constance promptly dismissed  him from her thoughts  in her estimation there was no reason to  fear him  he was a mere passer by  who on the morrow  perhaps  would  establish himself at the other end of france  then once more the thought  of blaise came back to her  imperative  all absorbing  and it suddenly  occurred to her that if she made haste home she would be able to see  morange alone in his office and ascertain many things from him before  the others arrived  it was evident that the accountant must know  something of the partnership scheme  even if it were as yet only in a  preliminary stage  thereupon she became impassioned  eager to arrive   certain as she felt of obtaining confidential information from morange   whom she deemed to be devoted to her     as the carriage rolled over the jena bridge she opened her eyes and  looked out    mon dieu    said she   what a time this brougham takes  if  the rain would only fall it would  perhaps  relieve my head a little      she was thinking  however  that a sharp shower would give her more time   as it would compel the three men  beauchene  denis  and blaise  to seek  shelter in some doorway  and when the carriage reached the works she  hastily stopped the coachman  without even conducting her companion to  the little pavilion      you will excuse me  won t you  my dear   said she   you only have to  turn the street corner      when they had both alighted  charlotte  smiling and affectionate  took  hold of constance s hand and retained it for a few moments in her own      of course   she replied   and many thanks  you are too kind  when  you see my husband  pray tell him that you left me safe  for he grows  anxious at the slightest thing      thereupon constance in her turn had to smile and promise with many  professions of friendship that she would duly execute the commission   then they parted   au revoir  till to morrow     yes  yes  till  to morrow  au revoir      eighteen years had now already elapsed since morange had lost his wife  valerie  and nine had gone by since the death of his daughter reine  yet  it always seemed as if he were on the morrow of those disasters  for  he had retained his black garb  and still led a cloister like  retired  life  giving utterance only to such words as were indispensable  on  the other hand  he had again become a good model clerk  a correct  painstaking accountant  very punctual in his habits  and rooted as it  were to the office chair in which he had taken his seat every morning  for thirty years past  the truth was that his wife and his daughter had  carried off with them all his will power  all his ambitious thoughts   all that he had momentarily dreamt of winning for their sakes  a large  fortune and a luxurious triumphant life  he  who was now so much alone   who had relapsed into childish timidity and weakness  sought nothing  beyond his humble daily task  and was content to die in the shady corner  to which he was accustomed  it was suspected  however  that he led a  mysterious maniacal life  tinged with anxious jealousy  at home  in that  flat of the boulevard de grenelle which he had so obstinately refused  to quit  his servant had orders to admit nobody  and she herself  knew nothing  if he gave her free admittance to the dining  and  drawing rooms  he did not allow her to set foot in his own bedroom   formerly shared by valerie  nor in that which reine had occupied  he  himself alone entered these chambers  which he regarded as sanctuaries   of which he was the sole priest  under pretence of sweeping or dusting   he would shut himself up in one or the other of them for hours at a  time  it was in vain that the servant tried to glance inside  in vain  that she listened at the doors when he spent his holidays at home  she  saw nothing and heard nothing  nobody could have told what relics those  chapels contained  nor with what religious cult he honored them  another  cause of surprise was his niggardly  avaricious life  which  as time  went on  had become more and more pronounced  in such wise that his only  expenses were his rental of sixteen hundred francs  the wages he paid  to his servant  and the few pence per day which she with difficulty  extracted from him to defray the cost of food and housekeeping  his  salary had now risen to eight thousand francs a year  and he certainly  did not spend half of it  what became  then  of his big savings  the  money which he refused to devote to enjoyment  in what secret hole  and  for what purpose  what secret passion  did he conceal it  nobody could  tell  but amid it all he remained very gentle  and  unlike most misers   continued very cleanly in his habits  keeping his beard  which was now  white as snow  very carefully tended  and he came to his office every  morning with a little smile on his face  in such wise that nothing in  this man of regular methodical life revealed the collapse within him   all the ashes and smoldering fire which disaster had left in his heart     by degrees a link of some intimacy had been formed between constance and  morange  when  after his daughter s death  she had seen him return to  the works quite a wreck  she had been stirred by deep pity  with which  some covert personal anxiety confusedly mingled  maurice was destined  to live five years longer  but she was already haunted by apprehensions   and could never meet morange without experiencing a chilling shudder   for he  as she repeated to herself  had lost his only child   ah  god   so such a catastrophe was possible   then  on being stricken herself  on  experiencing the horrible distress  on smarting from the sudden  gaping   incurable wound of her bereavement  she had drawn nearer to that brother  in misfortune  treating him with a kindness which she showed to none  other  at times she would invite him to spend an evening with her  and  the pair of them would chat together  or more often remain silent  face  to face  sharing each other s woe  later on she had profited by this  intimacy to obtain information from morange respecting affairs at the  factory  of which her husband avoided speaking  it was more particularly  since she had suspected the latter of bad management  blunders and  debts  that she endeavored to turn the accountant into a confidant  even  a spy  who might aid her to secure as much control of the business as  possible  and this was why she was so anxious to return to the factory  that day  and profit by the opportunity to see morange privately   persuaded as she was that she would induce him to speak out in the  absence of his superiors     she scarcely tarried to take off her gloves and her bonnet  she found  the accountant in his little office  seated in his wonted place  and  leaning over the everlasting ledger which was open before him      why  is the christening finished   he exclaimed in astonishment     forthwith she explained her presence in such a way as to enable her to  speak of what she had at heart   why  yes  that is to say  i came away  because i had such a dreadful headache  the others have remained yonder   and as we are alone here together it occurred to me that it might do me  good to have a chat with you  you know how highly i esteem you  ah  i am  not happy  not happy at all      she had sunk upon a chair overcome by the tears which she had been  restraining so long in the presence of the happiness of others  quite  upset at seeing her in this condition  having little strength himself   morange wished to summon her maid  he almost feared that she might have  a fainting fit  but she prevented him      i have only you left me  my friend   said she   everybody else forsakes  me  everybody is against me  i can feel it  i am being ruined  folks are  bent on annihilating me  as if i had not already lost everything when  i lost my child  and since you alone remain to me  you who know my  torments  you who have no daughter left you  pray for heaven s sake  help me and tell me the truth  in that wise i shall at least be able to  defend myself      on hearing her speak of his daughter morange also had begun to weep   and now  therefore  she might question him  it was certain that he would  answer and tell her everything  overpowered as he was by the common  grief which she had evoked  thus he informed her that an agreement was  indeed on the point of being signed by blaise and beauchene  only it was  not precisely a deed of partnership  beauchene having drawn large sums  from the strong box of the establishment for expenses which he could not  confess  a horrible story of blackmailing  so it was rumored  had been  obliged to make a confidant of blaise  the trusty and active lieutenant  who managed the establishment  and he had even asked him to find  somebody willing to lend him some money  thereupon the young man had  offered it himself  but doubtless it was his father  mathieu froment   who advanced the cash  well pleased to invest it in the works in his  son s name  and now  with the view of putting everything in order  it  had been resolved that the property should be divided into six parts   and that one of these parts or shares should be attributed to blaise  as reimbursement for the loan  thus the young fellow would possess an  interest of one sixth in the establishment  unless indeed beauchene  should buy him out again within a stipulated period  the danger was  that  instead of freeing himself in this fashion  beauchene might yield  to the temptation of selling the other parts one by one  now that he was  gliding down a path of folly and extravagance     constance listened to morange  quivering and quite pale   is this  signed   she asked      no  not yet  but the papers are ready and will be signed shortly   moreover  it is a reasonable and necessary solution of the difficulty      she was evidently of another opinion  a feeling of revolt possessed her   and she strove to think of some decisive means of preventing the ruin  and shame which in her opinion threatened her   my god  what am i to do   how can i act   she gasped  and then  in her rage at finding no device   at being powerless  this cry escaped her   ah  that scoundrel blaise      worthy morange was quite moved by it  still he had not fully understood   and so  in his quiet way  he endeavored to calm constance  explaining  that blaise had a very good heart  and that in the circumstances in  question he had behaved in the best way possible  doing all that he  could to stifle scandal  and even displaying great disinterestedness   and as constance had risen  satisfied with knowing the truth  and  anxious that the three men might not find her there on their arrival   the accountant likewise quitted his chair  and accompanied her along the  gallery which she had to follow in order to return to her house      i give you my word of honor  madame   said morange   that the young man  has made no base calculations in the matter  all the papers pass through  my hands  and nobody could know more than i know myself  besides  if i  had entertained the slightest doubt of any machination  i should have  endeavored to requite your kindness by warning you      she no longer listened to him  however  in fact  she was anxious to get  rid of him  for all at once the long threatening rain had begun to  fall violently  lashing the glass roof  so dark a mass of clouds had  overspread the sky that it was almost night in the gallery  though  four o clock had scarcely struck  and it occurred to constance that in  presence of such a deluge the three men would certainly take a cab  so  she hastened her steps  still followed  however  by the accountant      for instance   he continued   when it was a question of drawing up the  agreement       but he suddenly paused  gave vent to a hoarse exclamation  and stopped  her  pulling her back as if in terror      take care   he gasped     there was a great cavity before them  here  at the end of the gallery   before reaching the corridor which communicated with the private house   there was a steam lift of great power  which was principally used for  lowering heavy articles to the packing room  it only worked as a rule  on certain days  on all others the huge trap remained closed  when  the appliance was working a watchman was always stationed there to  superintend the operations      take care  take care   morange repeated  shuddering with terror     the trap was open  and the huge cavity gaped before them  there was no  barrier  nothing to warn them and prevent them from making a fearful  plunge  the rain still pelted on the glass roof  and the darkness had  become so complete in the gallery that they had walked on without  seeing anything before them  another step would have hurled them to  destruction  it was little short of miraculous that the accountant  should have become anxious in presence of the increasing gloom in that  corner  where he had divined rather than perceived the abyss     constance  however  still failing to understand her companion  sought to  free herself from his wild grasp      but look   he cried     and he bent forward and compelled her also to stoop over the cavity  it  descended through three floors to the very lowest basement  like a well  of darkness  a damp odor arose  one could scarce distinguish the vague  outlines of thick ironwork  alone  right at the bottom  burnt a lantern   a distant speck of light  as if the better to indicate the depth and  horror of the gulf  morange and constance drew back again blanching     and now morange burst into a temper   it is idiotic   he exclaimed   why  don t they obey the regulations  as a rule there is a man here  a man  expressly told off for this duty  who ought not to stir from his post so  long as the trap has not come up again  where is he  what on earth can  the rascal be up to      the accountant again approached the hole  and shouted down it in a fury    bonnard      no reply came  the pit remained bottomless  black and void      bonnard  bonnard      and still nothing was heard  not a sound  the damp breath of the  darkness alone ascended as from the deep silence of the tomb     thereupon morange resorted to action   i must go down  i must find  bonnard  can you picture us falling through that hole to the very  bottom  no  no  this cannot be allowed  either he must close this trap  or return to his post  what can he be doing  where can he be      morange had already betaken himself to a little winding staircase  by  which one reached every floor beside the lift  when in a voice which  gradually grew more indistinct  he again called   i beg you  madame   pray wait for me  remain there to warn anybody who might pass      constance was alone  the dull rattle of the rain on the glass above  her continued  but a little livid light was appearing as a gust of wind  carried off the clouds  and in that pale light blaise suddenly appeared  at the end of the gallery  he had just returned to the factory with  denis and beauchene  and had left his companions together for a moment   in order to go to the workshops to procure some information they  required  preoccupied  absorbed once more in his work  he came along  with an easy step  his head somewhat bent  and when constance saw him  thus appear  all that she felt in her heart was the smart of rancor  a  renewal of her anger at what she had learnt of that agreement which was  to be signed on the morrow and which would despoil her  that enemy who  was in her home and worked against her  a revolt of her whole being  urged her to exterminate him  and thrust him out like some usurper  all  craft and falsehood     he drew nearer  she was in the dense shadow near the wall  so that he  could not see her  but on her side  as he softly approached steeped in  a grayish light  she could see him with singular distinctness  never  before had she so plainly divined the power of his lofty brow  the  intelligence of his eyes  the firm will of his mouth  and all at once  she was struck with fulgural certainty  he was coming towards the cavity  without seeing it and he would assuredly plunge into the depths unless  she should stop him as he passed  but a little while before  she  like  himself  had come from yonder  and would have fallen unless a friendly  hand had restrained her  and the frightful shudder of that moment yet  palpitated in her veins  she could still and ever see the damp black pit  with the little lantern far below  the whole horror of it flashed before  her eyes  the ground failing one  the sudden drop with a great shriek   and the smash a moment afterwards     blaise drew yet nearer  but certainly such a thing was impossible  she  would prevent it  since a little motion of her hand would suffice   would she not always have time to stretch out her arms when he was there  before her  and yet from the recesses of her being a very clear and  frigid voice seemed to ascend  articulating brief words which rang in  her ears as if repeated by a trumpet blast  if he should die it would  be all over  the factory would never belong to him  she who had bitterly  lamented that she could devise no obstacle had merely to let this  helpful chance take its own course  and this  indeed  was what the  voice said  what it repeated with keen insistence  never adding another  syllable  after that there would be nothing  after that there would  merely remain the shattered remnants of a suppressed man  and a pit of  darkness splashed with blood  in which she discerned  foresaw nothing  more  what would happen on the morrow  she did not wish to know  indeed  there would be no morrow  it was solely the brutal immediate fact which  the imperious voice demanded  he dead  it would be all over  he would  never possess the works     he drew nearer still  and within her now there raged a frightful battle   how long did it last  days  years  doubtless but a few seconds  she was  still resolved that she would stop him as he passed  certain as she felt  that she would conquer her horrible thoughts when the moment came  for the decisive gesture  and yet those thoughts invaded her  became  materialized within her  like some physical craving  thirst or hunger   she hungered for that finish  hungered to the point of suffering  seized  by one of those sudden desperate longings which beget crime  such as  when a passer by is despoiled and throttled at the corner of a street   it seemed to her that if she could not satisfy her craving she herself  must lose her life  a consuming passion  a mad desire for that man s  annihilation filled her as she saw him approach  she could now see him  still more plainly and the sight of him exasperated her  his forehead   his eyes  his lips tortured her like some hateful spectacle  another  step  yet one more  then another  and he would be before her  yes  yet  another step  and she was already stretching out her hand in readiness  to stop him as soon as he should brush past     he came along  what was it that happened  o god  when he was there  so  absorbed in his thoughts that he brushed against her without feeling  her  she turned to stone  her hand became icy cold  she could not lift  it  it hung too heavily from her arm  and amid her scorching fever a  great cold shudder came upon her  immobilizing and stupefying her  while  she was deafened by the clamorous voice rising from the depths of her  being  all demur was swept away  the craving for that death remained  intense  invincible  beneath the imperious stubborn call of the inner  voice which robbed her of the power of will and action  he would be dead  and he would never possess the works  and therefore  standing stiff and  breathless against the wall  she did not stop him  she could hear his  light breathing  she could discern his profile  then the nape of his  neck  he had passed  another step  another step  and yet if she had  raised a call she might still have changed the course of destiny even at  that last moment  she fancied that she had some such intention  but she  was clenching her teeth tightly enough to break them  and he  blaise   took yet a further step  still advancing quietly and confidently over  that friendly ground  without even a glance before him  absorbed as he  was in thoughts of his work  and the ground failed him  and there was a  loud  terrible cry  a sudden gust following the fall  and a dull crash  down below in the depths of the black darkness     constance did not stir  for a moment she remained as if petrified  still  listening  still waiting  but only deep silence arose from the abyss   she could merely hear the rain pelting on the glass roof with renewed  rage  and thereupon she fled  turned into the passage  re entered  her drawing room  there she collected and questioned herself  had she  desired that abominable thing  no  her will had had nought to do with  it  most certainly it had been paralyzed  prevented from acting  if it  had been possible for the thing to occur  it had occurred quite apart  from her  for assuredly she had been absent  absent  that word reassured  her  yes  indeed  that was the case  she had been absent  all her past  life spread out behind her  faultless  pure of any evil action  never  had she sinned  never until that day had any consciousness of guilt  weighed upon her conscience  an honest and virtuous woman  she had  remained upright amidst all the excesses of her husband  an impassioned  mother  she had been ascending her calvary ever since her son s death   and this recollection of maurice alone drew her for a moment from her  callousness  choked her with a rising sob  as if in that direction lay  her madness  the vainly sought explanation of the crime  vertigo again  fell upon her  the thought of her dead son and of the other being master  in his place  all her perverted passion for that only son of hers  the  despoiled prince  all her poisoned  fermenting rage which had unhinged  and maddened her  even to the point of murder  had that monstrous  vegetation growing within her reached her brain then  a rush of blood  suffices at times to bedim a conscience  but she obstinately clung  to the view that she had been absent  she forced back her tears and  remained frigid  no remorse came to her  it was done  and  twas good  that it should be done  it was necessary  she had not pushed him  he  himself had fallen  had she not been there he would have fallen just the  same  and so since she had not been there  since both her brain and  her heart had been absent  it did not concern her  and ever and ever  resounded the words which absolved her and chanted her victory  he was  dead  and would never possess the works     erect in the middle of the drawing room  constance listened  straining  her ears  why was it that she heard nothing  how long they were in  going down to pick him up  anxiously waiting for the tumult which she  expected  the clamor of horror which would assuredly rise from the  works  the heavy footsteps  the loud calls  she held her breath   quivering at the slightest  faintest sound  several minutes still  elapsed  and the cosey quietude of her drawing room pleased her  that  room was like an asylum of bourgeois rectitude  luxurious dignity  in  which she felt protected  saved  some little objects on which her eyes  lighted  a pocket scent bottle ornamented with an opal  a paper knife of  burnished silver left inside a book  fully reassured her  she was moved   almost surprised at the sight of them  as if they had acquired some new  and particular meaning  then she shivered slightly and perceived that  her hands were icy cold  she rubbed them together gently  wishing to  warm them a little  why was it  too  that she now felt so tired  it  seemed to her as if she had just returned from some long walk  from  some accident  from some affray in which she had been bruised  she felt  within her also a tendency to somnolence  the somnolence of satiety  as  if she had feasted too copiously off some spicy dish  after too great  a hunger  amid the fatigue which benumbed her limbs she desired  nothing more  apart from her sleepiness all that she felt was a kind of  astonishment that things should be as they were  however  she had again  begun to listen  repeating that if that frightful silence continued   she would certainly sink upon a chair  close her eyes  and sleep  and  at last it seemed to her that she detected a faint sound  scarcely a  breath  far away     what was it  no  there was nothing yet  perhaps she had dreamt that  horrible scene  perhaps it had all been a nightmare  that man marching  on  that black pit  that loud cry of terror  since she heard nothing   perhaps nothing had really happened  were it true a clamor would have  ascended from below in a growing wave of sound  and a distracted rush  up the staircase and along the passages would have brought her the news   then again she detected the faint distant sound  which seemed to draw  a little nearer  it was not the tramping of a crowd  it seemed to be a  mere footfall  perhaps that of some pedestrian on the quay  yet no  it  came from the works  and now it was quite distinct  it ascended steps  and then sped along a passage  and the steps became quicker  and a  panting could be heard  so tragical that she at last divined that the  horror was at hand  all at once the door was violently flung open   morange entered  he was alone  beside himself  with livid face and  scarce able to stammer      he still breathes  but his head is smashed  it is all over       what ails you   she asked   what is the matter      he looked at her  agape  he had hastened upstairs at a run to ask  her for an explanation  for he had quite lost his poor head over that  unaccountable catastrophe  and the apparent ignorance and tranquillity  in which he found constance completed his dismay      but i left you near the trap   said he      near the trap  yes  you went down  and i immediately came up here       but before i went down   he resumed with despairing violence   i begged  you to wait for me and keep a watch on the hole  so that nobody might  fall through it       oh  dear no  you said nothing to me  or  at all events  i heard  nothing  understood nothing of that kind      in his terror he peered into her eyes  assuredly she was lying  calm as  she might appear  he could detect her voice trembling  besides  it was  evident she must still have been there  since he had not even had time  to get below before it happened  and all at once he recalled their  conversation  the questions she had asked him and her cry of hatred  against the unfortunate young fellow who had now been picked up  covered  with blood  in the depths of that abyss  beneath the gust of horror  which chilled him  morange could only find these words   well  madame   poor blaise came just behind you and broke his skull      her demeanor was perfect  her hands quivered as she raised them  and it  was in a halting voice that she exclaimed   good lord  good lord  what a  frightful misfortune      but at that moment an uproar arose through the house  the drawing room  door had remained open  and the voices and footsteps of a number of  people drew nearer  became each moment more distinct  orders were being  given on the stairs  men were straining and drawing breath  there were  all the signs of the approach of some cumbrous burden  carried as gently  as possible      what  is he being brought up here to me   exclaimed constance turning  pale  and her involuntary cry would have sufficed to enlighten the  accountant had he needed it   he is being brought to me here      it was not morange who answered  he was stupefied by the blow  but  beauchene abruptly appeared preceding the body  and he likewise was  livid and beside himself  to such a degree did this sudden visit of  death thrill him with fear  in his need of happy life      morange will have told you of the frightful catastrophe  my dear   said  he   fortunately denis was there  for the question of responsibility  towards his family  and it was denis  too  who  just as we were about  to carry the poor fellow home to the pavilion  opposed it  saying that   given his wife s condition  we should kill her if we carried him to her  in this dying state  and so the only course was to bring him here  was  it not      then he quitted his wife with a gesture of bewilderment  and returned  to the landing  where one could hear him repeating in a quivering voice    gently  gently  take care of the balusters      the lugubrious train entered the drawing room  blaise had been laid on  a stretcher provided with a mattress  denis  as pale as linen  followed   supporting the pillow on which rested his brother s head  a little  streamlet of blood coursed over the dying man s brow  his eyes were  closed  and four factory hands held the shafts of the stretcher  their  heavy shoes crushed down the carpet  and fragile articles of furniture  were thrust aside anyhow to open a passage for this invasion of horror  and of fright     amid his bewilderment  an idea occurred to beauchene  who continued to  direct the operation      no  no  don t leave him there  there is a bed in the next room  we will  take him up very gently with the mattress  and lay him with it on the  bed      it was maurice s room  it was the bed in which maurice had died  and  which constance with maternal piety had kept unchanged  consecrating the  room to her son s memory  but what could she say  how could she prevent  blaise from dying there in his turn  killed by her     the abomination of it all  the vengeance of destiny which exacted this  sacrilege  filled her with such a feeling of revolt that at the moment  when vertigo was about to seize her and the flooring began to flee from  beneath her feet  she was lashed by it and kept erect  and then she  displayed extraordinary strength  will  and insolent courage  when the  stricken man passed before her  her puny little frame stiffened and  grew  she looked at him  and her yellow face remained motionless  save  for a flutter of her eyelids and an involuntary nervous twinge on the  left side of her mouth  which forced a slight grimace  but that was all   and again she became perfect both in words and gesture  doing and saying  what was necessary without lavishness  but like one simply thunderstruck  by the suddenness of the catastrophe     however  the orders had been carried out in the bedroom  and the bearers  withdrew greatly upset  down below  directly the accident had been  discovered  old moineaud had been told to take a cab and hasten to dr   boutan s to bring him back with a surgeon  if one could be found on the  way      all the same  i prefer to have him here rather than in the basement    beauchene repeated mechanically as he stood before the bed   he still  breathes  there  see  it is quite apparent  who knows  perhaps boutan  may be able to pull him through  after all      denis  however  entertained no illusions  he had taken one of his  brother s cold yielding hands in his own and he could feel that it was  again becoming a mere thing  as if broken  wrenched away from life  in that great fall  for a moment he remained motionless beside the  death bed  with the mad hope they he might  perhaps  by his clasp infuse  a little of the blood in his own heart into the veins of the dying man   was not that blood common to them both  had not their twin brotherhood  drunk life from the same source  it was the other half of himself that  was about to die  down below  after raising a loud cry of heartrending  distress  he had said nothing  now all at once he spoke      one must go to ambroise s to warn my mother and father  since he still  breathes  perhaps they will arrive soon enough to embrace him       shall i go to fetch them   beauchene good naturedly inquired      no  no  thanks  i did at first think of asking that service of you   but i have reflected  nobody but myself can break this horrible news to  mamma  and nothing must be done as yet with regard to charlotte  we will  see about that by and by  when i come back  i only hope that death will  have a little patience  so that i may find my poor brother still alive      he leant forward and kissed blaise  who with his eyes closed remained  motionless  still breathing faintly  then distractedly denis printed  another kiss upon his hand and hurried off     constance meantime was busying herself  calling the maid  and requesting  her to bring some warm water in order that they might wash the  sufferer s blood stained brow  it was impossible to think of taking off  his jacket  they had to content themselves with doing the little they  could to improve his appearance pending the arrival of the doctor  and  during these preparations  beauchene  haunted  worried by the accident   again began to speak of it      it is incomprehensible  one can hardly believe such a stupid mischance  to be possible  down below the transmission gearing gets out of order   and this prevents the mechanician from sending the trap up again  then   up above  bonnard gets angry  calls  and at last decides to go down in a  fury when he finds that nobody answers him  then morange arrives  flies  into a temper  and goes down in his turn  exasperated at receiving no  answer to his calls for bonnard  poor bonnard  he s sobbing  he wanted  to kill himself when he saw the fine result of his absence      at this point beauchene abruptly broke off and turned to constance    but what about you   he asked   morange told me that he had left you up  above near the trap      she was standing in front of her husband  in the full light which  came through the window  and again did her eyelids beat while a little  nervous twinge slightly twisted her mouth on the left side  that was  all      i  why i had gone down the passage  i came back here at once  as  morange knows very well      a moment previously  morange  annihilated  his legs failing him  had  sunk upon a chair  incapable of rendering any help  he sat there silent   awaiting the end  when he heard constance lie in that quiet fashion  he  looked at her  the assassin was herself  he no longer doubted it  and at  that moment he felt a craving to proclaim it  to cry it aloud      why  he thought that he had begged you to remain there on the watch    beauchene resumed  addressing his wife      at all events his words never reached me   constance duly answered    should i have moved if he had asked me to do that   and turning towards  the accountant she  in her turn  had the courage to fix her pale eyes  upon him   just remember  morange  you rushed down like a madman  you  said nothing to me  and i went on my way      beneath those pale eyes  keen as steel  which dived into his own   morange was seized with abject fear  all his weakness  his cowardice  of heart returned  could he accuse her of such an atrocious crime  he  pictured the consequences  and then  too  he no longer knew if he were  right or not  his poor maniacal mind was lost      it is possible   he stammered   i may simply have thought i spoke  and  it must be so since it can t be otherwise      then he relapsed into silence with a gesture of utter lassitude  the  complicity demanded was accepted  for a moment he thought of rising to  see if blaise still breathed  but he did not dare  deep peacefulness  fell upon the room     ah  how great was the anguish  the torture in the cab  when blaise  brought mathieu and marianne back with him  he had at first spoken to  them simply of an accident  a rather serious fall  but as the vehicle  rolled along he had lost his self possession  weeping and confessing the  truth in response to their despairing questions  thus  when they at last  reached the factory  they doubted no longer  their child was dead  work  had just been stopped  and they recalled their visit to the place on the  morrow of maurice s death  they were returning to the same stillness   the same grave like silence  all the rumbling life had suddenly ceased   the machines were cold and mute  the workshops darkened and deserted   not a sound remained  not a soul  not a puff of that steam which was  like the very breath of the place  he who had watched over its work was  dead  and it was dead like him  then their affright increased when they  passed from the factory to the house amid that absolute solitude  the  gallery steeped in slumber  the staircase quivering  all the doors  upstairs open  as in some uninhabited place long since deserted  in the  ante room they found no servant  and it was indeed in the same tragedy  of sudden death that they again participated  only this time it was  their own son whom they were to find in the same room  on the same bed   frigid  pale  and lifeless     blaise had just expired  boutan was there at the head of the bed   holding the inanimate hand in which the final pulsation of blood was  dying away  and when he saw mathieu and marianne  who had instinctively  crossed the disorderly drawing room  rushing into that bedchamber whose  odor of nihility they recognized  he could but murmur in a voice full of  sobs      my poor friends  embrace him  you will yet have a little of his last  breath      that breath had scarce ceased  and the unhappy mother  the unhappy  father  had already sprung forward  kissing those lips that exhaled the  final quiver of life  and sobbing and crying their distress aloud  their  blaise was dead  like rose  he had died suddenly  a year later  on a  day of festivity  their heart wound  scarce closed as yet  opened afresh  with a tragic rending  amid their long felicity this was the second time  that they were thus terribly recalled to human wretchedness  this was  the second hatchet stroke which fell on the flourishing  healthy  happy  family  and their fright increased  had they not yet finished paying  their accumulated debt to misfortune  was slow destruction now arriving  with blow following blow  already since rose had quitted them  her  bier strewn with flowers  they had feared to see their prosperity and  fruitfulness checked and interrupted now that there was an open breach   and to day  through that bloody breach  their blaise departed in the  most frightful of fashions  crushed as it were by the jealous anger of  destiny  and now what other of their children would be torn away from  them on the morrow to pay in turn the ransom of their happiness     mathieu and marianne long remained sobbing on their knees beside the  bed  constance stood a few paces away  silent  with an air of quivering  desolation  beauchene  as if to combat that fear of death which made  him shiver  had a moment previously seated himself at the little  writing table formerly used by maurice  which had been left in the  drawing room like a souvenir  and he then strove to draw up a notice  to his workpeople  to inform them that the factory would remain closed  until the day after the funeral  he was vainly seeking words when he  perceived denis coming out of the bedroom  where he had wept all his  tears and set his whole heart in the last kiss which he had bestowed on  his departed brother  beauchene called him  as if desirous of diverting  him from his gloomy thoughts   there  sit down here and continue this    said he     constance  in her turn entering the drawing room  heard those words   they were virtually the same as the words which her husband had  pronounced when making blaise seat himself at that same table of  maurice s  on the day when he had given him the place of that poor boy   whose body almost seemed to be still lying on the bed in the adjoining  room  and she recoiled with fright on seeing denis seated there and  writing  had not blaise resuscitated  even as she had mistaken the twins  one for the other that very afternoon on rising from the gay baptismal  lunch  so now again she saw blaise in denis  the pair of them so similar  physically that in former times their parents had only been able to  distinguish them by the different color of their eyes  and thus it was  as if blaise returned and resumed his place  blaise  who would possess  the works although she had killed him  she had made a mistake  dead  as he was  he would nevertheless have the works  she had killed one of  those froments  but behold another was born  when one died his brother  filled up the breach  and her crime then appeared to her such a useless  one  such a stupid one  that she was aghast at it  the hair on the nape  of her neck standing up  while she burst into a cold sweat of fear  and  recoiled as from a spectre      it is a notice for the workpeople   beauchene repeated   we will have  it posted at the entrance      she wished to be brave  and  approaching her husband  she said to him    draw it up yourself  why give blaise the trouble at such a moment as  this      she had said  blaise   and once more an icy sensation of horror came  over her  unconsciously she had heard herself saying yonder  in the  ante room   blaise  where did i put my boa   and it was denis who had  brought it to her  of what use had it been for her to kill blaise  since  denis was there  when death mows down a soldier of life  another is  always ready to take the vacant post of combat     but a last defeat awaited her  mathieu and marianne reappeared  while  morange  seized with a need of motion  came and went with an air of  stupefaction  quite losing his wits amid his dreadful sufferings  those  awful things which could but unhinge his narrow mind      i am going down   stammered marianne  trying to wipe away her tears and  to remain erect   i wish to see charlotte  and prepare and tell her of  the misfortune  i alone can find the words to say  so that she may not  die of the shock  circumstanced as she is      but mathieu  full of anxiety  sought to detain his wife  and spare her  this fresh trial   no  i beg you   he said   denis will go  or i will go  myself      with gentle obstinacy  however  she still went towards the stairs   i  am the only one who can tell her of it  i assure you  i shall have  strength       but all at once she staggered and fainted  it became necessary to lay  her on a sofa in the drawing room  and when she recovered consciousness   her face remained quite white and distorted  and an attack of nausea  came upon her  then  as constance  with an air of anxious solicitude   rang for her maid and sent for her little medicine chest  mathieu  confessed the truth  which hitherto had been kept secret  marianne  like  charlotte  was  enceinte   it confused her a little  he said  since she  was now three and forty years old  and so they had not mentioned  it   ah  poor brave wife   he added   she wished to spare our  daughter in law too great a shock  i trust that she herself will not be  struck down by it       enceinte   good heavens  as constance heard this  it seemed as if a  bludgeon were falling on her to make her defeat complete  and so  even  if she should now let denis  in his turn  kill himself  another froment  was coming who would replace him  there was ever another and another of  that race  a swarming of strength  an endless fountain of life  against  which it became impossible to battle  amid her stupefaction at  finding the breach repaired when scarce opened  constance realized her  powerlessness and nothingness  childless as she was fated to remain  and  she felt vanquished  overcome with awe  swept away as it were herself   thrust aside by the victorious flow of everlasting fruitfulness           xviii    fourteen months later there was a festival at chantebled  denis  who had  taken blaise s place at the factory  was married to marthe desvignes   and after all the grievous mourning this was the first smile  the bright  warm sun of springtime  so to say  following severe winter  mathieu and  marianne  hitherto grief stricken and clad in black  displayed a gayety  tinged with soft emotion in presence of the sempiternal renewal of life   the mother had been willing to don less gloomy a gown  and the father  had agreed to defer no longer a marriage that had long since been  resolved upon  and was necessitated by all sorts of considerations  for  more than two years now rose had been sleeping in the little cemetery of  janville  and for more than a year blaise had joined her there  beneath  flowers which were ever fresh  and the souvenir of the dear dead ones   whom they all visited  and who had remained alive in all their hearts   was to participate in the coming festival  it was as if they themselves  had decided with their parents that the hour for the espousals had  struck  and that regret for their loss ought no longer to bar the joy of  growth and increase     denis s installation at the beauchene works in his brother s place had  come about quite naturally  if he had not gone thither on leaving the  science school where he had spent three years  it was simply because  the position was at that time already held by blaise  all his technical  studies marked him out for the post  in a single day he had fitted  himself for it  and he simply had to take up his quarters in the little  pavilion  charlotte having fled to chantebled with her little berthe  directly after the horrible catastrophe  it should be added that denis   entry into the establishment offered a convenient solution with  regard to the large sum of money lent to beauchene  which  it had been  arranged  should be reimbursed by a sixth share in the factory  that  money came from the family  and one brother simply took the place of the  other  signing the agreement which the deceased would have signed  with  a delicate rectitude  however  denis insisted that out of his share of  the profits an annuity should be assigned to charlotte  his brother s  widow     thus matters were settled in a week  in the manner that circumstances  logically demanded  and without possibility of discussion  constance   bewildered and overwhelmed  was not even able to struggle  her husband  reduced her to silence by repeating   what would you have me do  i must  have somebody to help me  and it is just as well to take denis as a  stranger  besides  if he worries me i will buy him out within a year and  give him his dismissal      at this constance remained silent to avoid casting his ignominy in his  face  amid her despair at feeling the walls of the house crumble and  fall  bit by bit  upon her     once installed at the works  denis considered that the time had come to  carry out the matrimonial plans which he had long since arranged with  marthe desvignes  the latter  charlotte s younger sister and at one  time the inseparable friend of rose  had been waiting for him for nearly  three years now  with her bright smile and air of affectionate good  sense  they had known one another since childhood  and had exchanged  many a vow along the lonely paths of janville  but they had said to one  another that they would do nothing prematurely  that for the happiness  of a whole lifetime one might well wait until one was old enough and  strong enough to undertake family duties  some people were greatly  astonished that a young man whose future was so promising  and whose  position at twenty six years of age was already a superb one  should  thus obstinately espouse a penniless girl  mathieu and marianne smiled   however  and consented  knowing their son s good reasons  he had no  desire to marry a rich girl who would cost him more than she brought   and he was delighted at having discovered a pretty  healthy  and  very sensible and skilful young woman  who would be at all times his  companion  helpmate  and consoler  he feared no surprises with her  for  he had studied her  she united charm and good sense with kindliness  all  that was requisite for the happiness of a household  and he himself was  very good natured  prudent  and sensible  and she knew it and willingly  took his arm to tread life s path with him  certain as she felt that  they would thus walk on together until life s end should be reached   ever advancing with the same tranquil step under the divine and limpid  sun of reason merged in love     great preparations were made at chantebled on the day before the  wedding  nevertheless  the ceremony was to remain of an intimate  character  on account of the recent mourning  the only guests  apart  from members of the family  were the seguins and the beauchenes  and  even the latter were cousins  so there would scarcely be more than a  score of them altogether  and only a lunch was to be given  one matter  which gave them some brief concern was to decide where to set the table   and how to decorate it  those early days of july were so bright and warm  that they resolved to place it out of doors under the trees  there was  a fitting and delightful spot in front of the old shooting box  the  primitive pavilion  which had been their first residence on their  arrival in the janville district  that pavilion was indeed like the  family nest  the hearth whence it had radiated over the surrounding  region  as the pavilion had threatened ruin  mathieu had repaired  and enlarged it with the idea of retiring thither with marianne  and  charlotte and her children  as soon as he should cede the farm to his  son gervais  that being his intention  he was  indeed  pleased with  the idea of living in retirement like a patriarch  like a king who  had willingly abdicated  but whose wise counsel was still sought and  accepted  in place of the former wild garden a large lawn now stretched  before the pavilion  surrounded by some beautiful trees  elms and  hornbeams  these mathieu had planted  and he had watched them grow  thus  they seemed to him to be almost part of his flesh  but his real favorite  was an oak tree  nearly twenty years of age and already sturdy  which  stood in the centre of the lawn  where he had planted it with marianne   who had held the slender sapling in position while he plied his spade on  the day when they had founded their domain of chantebled  and near this  oak  which thus belonged to their robust family  there was a basin of  living water  fed by the captured springs of the plateau  water whose  crystalline song made the spot one of continual joy     it was here then that a council was held on the day before the wedding   mathieu and marianne repaired thither to see what preparations would  be necessary  and they found charlotte with a sketch book on her knees   rapidly finishing an impression of the oak tree      what is that  a surprise   they asked     she smiled with some confusion   yes  yes  a surprise  you will see      then she confessed that for a fortnight past she had been designing in  water colors a series of menu cards for the wedding feast  and  prettily  and lovingly enough  her idea had been to depict children s games  and children s heads  indeed  all the members of the family in their  childish days  she had taken their likenesses from old photographs   and her sketch of the oak tree was to serve as a background for the  portraits of the two youngest scions of the house  little benjamin and  little guillaume     mathieu and marianne were delighted with that fleet procession of little  faces all white and pink which they perfectly recognized as they saw  them pass before their eyes  there were the twins nestling in their  cradle  locked in one another s arms  there was rose  the dear lost  one  in her little shift  there were ambroise and gervais  bare   and wrestling on a patch of grass  there were gregoire and nicolas  birdnesting  there were claire and the three other girls  louise   madeleine  and marguerite  romping about the farm  quarrelling with the  fowls  springing upon the horses  backs  but what particularly touched  marianne was the sketch of her last born  little benjamin  now nine  months old  whom charlotte had depicted reclining under the oak tree in  the same little carriage as her own son guillaume  who was virtually of  the same age  having been born but eight days later      the uncle and the nephew   said mathieu jestingly   all the same  the  uncle is the elder by a week      as marianne stood there smiling  soft tears came into her eyes  and the  sketch shook in her happy hands      the dears   said she   my son and grandson  with those dear little ones  i am once again a mother and a grandmother  ah  yes  those two are the  supreme consolation  they have helped to heal the wound  it is they who  have brought us back hope and courage      this was true  how overwhelming had been the mourning and sadness of the  early days when charlotte  fleeing the factory  had sought refuge at the  farm  the tragedy by which blaise had been carried off had nearly killed  her  her first solace was to see that her daughter berthe  who had been  rather sickly in paris  regained bright rosy cheeks amid the open air  of chantebled  moreover  she had settled her life  she would spend her  remaining years  in that hospitable house  devoting herself to her  two children  and happy in having so affectionate a grandmother and  grandfather to help and sustain her  she had always shown herself to be  somewhat apart from life  possessed of a dreamy nature  only asking to  love and to be loved in return     so by degrees she settled down once more  installed beside her  grandparents in the old pavilion  which mathieu fitted up for the three  of them  and wishing to occupy herself  irrespective of her income from  the factory  she even set to work again and painted miniatures  which  a dealer in paris readily purchased  but her grief was mostly healed by  her little guillaume  that child bequeathed to her by her dead husband   in whom he resuscitated  and it was much the same with marianne since  the birth of benjamin  a new son had replaced the one she had lost  and  helped to fill the void in her heart  the two women  the two mothers   found infinite solace in nursing those babes  for them they forgot  themselves  they reared them together  watching them grow side by side   they gave them the breast at the same hours  and it was their desire to  see them both become very strong  very handsome  and very good  although  one mother was almost twice as old as the other  they became  as it  were  sisters  the same nourishing milk flowed from both their fruitful  bosoms  and gleams of light penetrated their mourning  they began to  laugh when they saw those little cherubs laugh  and nothing could have  been gayer than the sight of that mother in law and that daughter in law  side by side  almost mingling  having but one cradle between them  amid  an unceasing florescence of maternity      be careful   mathieu suddenly said to charlotte   hide your drawings   here are gervais and claire coming about the table      gervais at nineteen years of age was quite a colossus  the tallest and  the strongest of the family  with short  curly black hair  large bright  eyes  and a full broad featured face  he had remained his father s  favorite son  the son of the fertile earth  the one in whom mathieu  fostered a love for the estate  a passion for skilful agriculture  in  order that later on the young man might continue the good work which had  been begun  mathieu already disburdened himself on gervais of a part  of his duties  and was only waiting to see him married to give him the  control of the whole farm  and he often thought of adjoining to him  claire when she found a husband in some worthy  sturdy fellow who would  assume part of the labor  two men agreeing well would be none too many  for an enterprise which was increasing in importance every day  since  marianne had again been nursing  claire had been attending to her work   though she had no beauty  she was of vigorous health and quite strong  for her seventeen years  she busied herself more particularly with  cookery and household affairs  but she also kept the accounts  being  shrewd witted and very economically inclined  on which account the  prodigals of the family often made fun of her      and so it s here that the table is to be set   said gervais   i shall  have to see that the lawn is mowed then      on her side claire inquired what number of people there would be at  table and how she had better place them  then  gervais having called  to frederic to bring a scythe  the three of them went on discussing the  arrangements  after rose s death  frederic  her betrothed  had continued  working beside gervais  becoming his most active and intelligent comrade  and helper  for some months  too  marianne and mathieu had noticed that  he was revolving around claire  as though  since he had lost the elder  girl  he were willing to content himself with the younger one  who was  far less beautiful no doubt  but withal a good and sturdy housewife   this had at first saddened the parents  was it possible to forget their  dear daughter  then  however  they felt moved  for the thought came  to them that the family ties would be drawn yet closer  that the young  fellow s heart would not roam in search of love elsewhere  but would  remain with them  so closing their eyes to what went on  they smiled   for in frederic  when claire should be old enough to marry  gervais  would find the brother in law and partner that he needed     the question of the table had just been settled when a sudden invasion  burst through the tall grass around the oak tree  skirts flew about  and  loose hair waved in the sunshine      oh   cried louise   there are no roses       no   repeated madeleine   not a single white rose       and   added marguerite   we have inspected all the bushes  there are no  white roses  only red ones      thirteen  eleven  and nine  such were their respective ages  louise   plump and gay  already looked a little woman  madeleine  slim and  pretty  spent hours at her piano  her eyes full of dreaminess   marguerite  whose nose was rather too large and whose lips were thick   had beautiful golden hair  she would pick up little birds at winter time  and warm them with her hands  and the three of  them  after scouring the  back garden  where flowers mingled with vegetables  had now rushed up in  despair at their vain search  no white roses for a wedding  that was the  end of everything  what could they offer to the bride  and what could  they set upon the table     behind the three girls  however  appeared gregoire  with jeering mien   and his hands in his pockets  at fifteen he was very malicious  the most  turbulent  worrying member of the family  a lad inclined to the most  diabolical devices  his pointed nose and his thin lips denoted also  his adventurous spirit  his will power  and his skill in effecting his  object  and  apparently much amused by his sisters  disappointment  he  forgot himself and exclaimed  by way of teasing them   why  i know where  there are some white roses  and fine ones  too       where is that   asked mathieu      why  at the mill  near the wheel  in the little enclosure  there are  three big bushes which are quite white  with roses as big as cabbages      then he flushed and became confused  for his father was eyeing him  severely      what  do you still prowl round the mill   said mathieu   i had  forbidden you to do so  as you know that there are white roses in the  enclosure you must have gone in  eh       no  i looked over the wall       you climbed up the wall  that s the finishing touch  so you want  to land me in trouble with those lepailleurs  who are decidedly very  foolish and very malicious people  there is really a devil in you  my  boy      that which gregoire left unsaid was that he repaired to the enclosure  in order that he might there join therese  the miller s fair haired  daughter with the droll  laughing face  who was also a terribly  adventurous damsel for her thirteen years  true  their meetings were but  childish play  but at the end of the enclosure  under the apple trees   there was a delightful nook where one could laugh and chat and amuse  oneself at one s ease      well  just listen to me   mathieu resumed   i won t have you going to  play with therese again  she is a pretty little girl  no doubt  but  that house is not a place for you to go to  it seems that they fight one  another there now      this was a fact  when that young scamp antonin had recovered his health   he had been tormented by a longing to return to paris  and had done all  he could with that object  in view of resuming a life of idleness and  dissipation  lepailleur  greatly irritated at having been duped by his  son  had at first violently opposed his plans  but what could he do in  the country with that idle fellow  whom he himself had taught to hate  the earth and to sneer at the old rotting mill  besides  he now had  his wife against him  she was ever admiring her son s learning  and so  stubborn was her faith in him that she was convinced that he would this  time secure a good position in the capital  thus the father had been  obliged to give way  and antonin was now finally wrecking his life while  filling some petty employment at a merchant s in the rue du mail  but   on the other hand  the quarrelling increased in the home  particularly  whenever lepailleur suspected his wife of robbing him in order to send  money to that big lazybones  their son  from the bridge over the yeuse  on certain days one could hear oaths and blows flying about  and here  again was family life destroyed  strength wasted  and happiness spoilt     carried off by perfect anger  mathieu continued   to think of it  people  who had everything needful to be happy  how can one be so stupid  how  can one seek wretchedness for oneself with such obstinacy  as for that  idea of theirs of an only son  and their vanity in wanting to make a  gentleman of him  ah  well  they have succeeded finely  they must be  extremely pleased to day  it is just like lepailleur s hatred of the  earth  his old fashioned system of cultivation  his obstinacy in leaving  his bit of moorland barren and refusing to sell it to me  no doubt  by way of protesting against our success  can you imagine anything so  stupid  and it s just like his mill  all folly and idleness he stands  still  looking at it fall into ruins  he at least had a reason for that  in former times  he used to say that as the region had almost renounced  corn growing  the peasants did not bring him enough grain to set his  mill stones working  but nowadays when  thanks to us  corn overflows on  all sides  surely he ought to have pulled down his old wheel and have  replaced it by a good engine  ah  if i were in his place i would already  have a new and bigger mill there  making all use of the water of the  yeuse  and connecting it with janville railway station by a line of  rails  which would not cost so much to lay down      gregoire stood listening  well pleased that the storm should fall on  another than himself  and marianne  seeing that her three daughters were  still greatly grieved at having no white roses  consoled them  saying    well  for the table to morrow morning you must gather those which are  the lightest in color  the pale pink ones  they will do very well      thereupon mathieu  calming down  made the children laugh  by adding  gayly   gather the red ones too  the reddest you find  they will  symbolize the blood of life      marianne and charlotte were still lingering there talking of all the  preparations  when other little feet came tripping through the grass   nicolas  quite proud of his seven years  was leading his niece berthe   a big girl of six  they agreed very well together  that day they had  remained indoors playing at  fathers and mothers  near the cradle  occupied by benjamin and guillaume  whom they called their babies   but all at once the infants had awoke  clamoring for nourishment  and  nicolas and berthe  quite alarmed  had thereupon run off to fetch the  two mothers      mamma   called nicolas   benjamin s asking for you  he s thirsty       mamma  mamma   repeated berthe   guillaume s thirsty  come quick  he s  in a hurry      marianne and charlotte laughed  true enough  the morrow s wedding had  made them forget their pets  and so they hastily returned to the house     on the following day those happy nuptials were celebrated in  affectionate intimacy  there were but one and twenty at table under the  oak tree in the middle of the lawn  which  girt with elms and hornbeams   seemed like a hall of verdure  the whole family was present  first  those of the farm  then denis the bridegroom  next ambroise and his wife  andree  who had brought their little leonce with them  and apart from  the family proper  there were only the few invited relatives  beauchene  and constance  seguin and valentine  with  of course  madame desvignes   the bride s mother  there were twenty one at table  as has been said   but besides those one and twenty there were three very little ones  present  leonce  who at fifteen months had just been weaned  and  benjamin and guillaume  who still took the breast  their little  carriages had been drawn up near  so that they also belonged to the  party  which was thus a round two dozen  and the table  flowery with  roses  sent forth a delightful perfume under the rain of summer sunbeams  which flecked it with gold athwart the cool shady foliage  from one  horizon to the other stretched the wondrous tent of azure of the  triumphant july sky  and marthe s white bridal gown  and the bright  dresses of the girls  big and little  all those gay frocks  and all that  fine youthful health  seemed like the very florescence of that green  nook of happiness  they lunched joyously  and ended by clinking glasses  in country fashion  while wishing all sorts of prosperity to the bridal  pair and to everybody present     then  while the servants were removing the cloth  seguin  who affected  an interest in horse breeding and cattle raising  wished mathieu to show  him his stables  he had talked nothing but horseflesh during the meal   and was particularly desirous of seeing some big farm horses  whose  great strength had been praised by his host  he persuaded beauchene  to join him in the inspection  and the three men were starting  when  constance and valentine  somewhat inquisitive with respect to that farm   the great growth of which still filled them with stupefaction  decided  to follow  leaving the rest of the family installed under the trees   amid the smiling peacefulness of that fine afternoon     the cow houses and stables were on the right hand  but in order to reach  them one had to cross the great yard  whence the entire estate could  be seen  and here there was a halt  a sudden stopping inspired by  admiration  so grandly did the work accomplished show forth under the  sun  they had known that land dry and sterile  covered with mere  scrub  they beheld it now one sea of waving corn  of crops whose growth  increased at each successive season  up yonder  on the old marshy  plateau  the fertility was such  thanks to the humus amassed during long  centuries  that mathieu did not even manure the ground as yet  then   to right and to left  the former sandy slopes spread out all greenery   fertilized by the springs which ever brought them increase of  fruitfulness  and the very woods afar off  skilfully arranged  aired by  broad clearings  seemed to possess more sap  as if all the surrounding  growth of life had instilled additional vigor into them  with this  vigor  this power  indeed  the whole domain was instinct  it was  creation  man s labor fertilizing sterile soil  and drawing from it  a wealth of nourishment for expanding humanity  the conqueror of the  world     there was a long spell of silence  at last seguin  in his dry shrill  voice  with a tinge of bitterness born of his own ruin  remarked   you  have done a good stroke of business  i should never have believed it  possible      then they walked on again  but in the sheds  the cow houses  the  sheep cotes  and all round  the sensation of strength and power yet  increased  creation was there continuing  the cattle  the sheep  the  fowls  the rabbits  all that dwelt and swarmed there were incessantly  increasing and multiplying  each year the ark became too small  and  fresh pens and fresh buildings were required  life increased life  on  all sides there were fresh broods  fresh flocks  fresh herds  all the  conquering wealth of inexhaustible fruitfulness     when they reached the stables seguin greatly admired the big draught  horses  and praised them with the expressions of a connoisseur  then  he returned to the subject of breeding  and cited some extraordinary  results that one of his friends obtained by certain crosses  so far as  the animal kingdom was concerned his ideas were sound enough  but when  he came to the consideration of human kind he was as erratic as ever  as  they walked back from the stables he began to descant on the population  question  denouncing the century  and repeating all his old theories   perhaps it was jealous rancor that impelled him to protest against the  victory of life which the whole farm around him proclaimed so loudly   depopulation  why  it did not extend fast enough  paris  which wished to  die  so people said  was really taking its time about it  all the same   he noticed some good symptoms  for bankruptcy was increasing on all  sides  in science  politics  literature  and even art  liberty was  already dead  democracy  by exasperating ambitious instincts and setting  classes in conflict for power  was rapidly leading to a social collapse   only the poor still had large families  the elite  the people of wealth  and intelligence  had fewer and fewer children  so that  before final  annihilation came  there might still be a last period of acceptable  civilization  in which there would remain only a few men and women of  supreme refinement  content with perfumes for sustenance and mere breath  for enjoyment  he  however  was disgusted  for he now felt certain that  he would not see that period since it was so slow in coming      if only christianity would return to the primitive faith   he  continued   and condemn woman as an impure  diabolical  and harmful  creature  we might go and lead holy lives in the desert  and in that way  bring the world to an end much sooner  but the political catholicism of  nowadays  anxious to keep alive itself  allows and regulates marriage   with the view of maintaining things as they are  oh  you will say  of  course  that i myself married and that i have children  which is true   but i am pleased to think that they will redeem my fault  gaston says  that a soldier s only wife ought to be his sword  and so he intends  to remain single  and as lucie  on her side  has taken the veil at the  ursulines  i feel quite at ease  my race is  so to say  already extinct   and that delights me      mathieu listened with a smile  he was acquainted with that more or  less literary form of pessimism  in former days all such views  as  for  instance  the struggle of civilization against the birth rate  and the  relative childlessness of the most intelligent and able members of the  community  had disturbed him  but since he had fought the cause of love  he had found another faith  thus he contented himself with saying rather  maliciously   but you forget your daughter andree and her little boy  leonce       oh  andree   replied seguin  waving his hand as if she did not belong  to him     valentine  however  had stopped short  gazing at him fixedly  since  their household had been wrecked and they had been leading lives apart   she no longer tolerated his sudden attacks of insane brutality and  jealousy  by reason also of the squandering of their fortune she had a  hold on him  for he feared that she might ask for certain accounts to be  rendered her      yes   he granted   there is andree  but then girls don t count      they were walking on again when beauchene  who had hitherto contented  himself with puffing and chewing his cigar  for reserve was imposed upon  him by the frightful drama of his own family life  was unable to  remain silent any longer  forgetful  relapsing into the extraordinary  unconsciousness which always set him erect  like a victorious superior  man  he spoke out loudly and boldly      i don t belong to seguin s school  but  all the same  he says some true  things  that population question greatly interests me even now  and  i can flatter myself that i know it fully  well  it is evident that  malthus was right  it is not allowable for people to have families  without knowing how they will be able to nourish them  if the poor die  of starvation it is their fault  and not ours      then he reverted to his usual lecture on the subject  the governing  classes alone were reasonable in keeping to small families  a country  could only produce a certain supply of food  and was therefore  restricted to a certain population  people talked of the faulty division  of wealth  but it was madness to dream of an utopia  where there would  be no more masters but only so many brothers  equal workers and sharers   who would apportion happiness among themselves like a birthday cake   all the evil then came from the lack of foresight among the poor   though with brutal frankness he admitted that employers readily availed  themselves of the circumstance that there was a surplus of children to  hire labor at reduced rates     then  losing all recollection of the past  infatuated  intoxicated with  his own ideas  he went on talking of himself   people pretend that we  are not patriots because we don t leave troops of children behind us   but that is simply ridiculous  each serves the country in his own way   if the poor folks give it soldiers  we give it our capital  all the  proceeds of our commerce and industry  a fine lot of good would it do  the country if we were to ruin ourselves with big families  which would  hamper us  prevent us from getting rich  and afterwards destroy whatever  we create by subdividing it  with our laws and customs there can be no  substantial fortune unless a family is limited to one son  and yes  that  is necessary  but one son  an only son  that is the only wise course   therein lies the only possible happiness      it became so painful to hear him  in his position  speaking in that  fashion  that the others remained silent  full of embarrassment  and  he  thinking that he was convincing them  went on triumphantly   thus  i  myself       but at this moment constance interrupted him  she had hitherto walked  on with bowed head amid that flow of chatter which brought her so much  torture and shame  an aggravation  as it were  of her defeat  but now  she raised her face  down which two big tears were trickling      alexandre   she said      what is it  my dear      he did not yet understand  but on seeing her tears  he ended by feeling  disturbed  in spite of all his fine assurance  he looked at the others   and wishing to have the last word  he added   ah  yes  our poor child   but particular cases have nothing to do with general theories  ideas are  still ideas      silence fell between them  they were now near the lawn where the family  had remained  and for the last moment mathieu had been thinking of  morange  whom he had also invited to the wedding  but who had excused  himself from attending  as if he were terrified at the idea of gazing  on the joy of others  and dreaded  too  lest some sacrilegious attempt  should be made in his absence on the mysterious sanctuary where he  worshipped  would he  morange  so mathieu wondered  have clung like  beauchene to his former ideas  would he still have defended the theory  of the only child  that hateful  calculating theory which had cost him  both his wife and his daughter  mathieu could picture him flitting  past  pale and distracted  with the step of a maniac hastening to some  mysterious end  in which insanity would doubtless have its place  but  the lugubrious vision vanished  and then again before mathieu s eyes  the lawn spread out under the joyous sun  offering between its belt of  foliage such a picture of happy health and triumphant beauty  that he  felt impelled to break the mournful silence and exclaim      look there  look there  isn t that gay  isn t that a delightful  scene  all those dear women and dear children in that setting of  verdure  it ought to be painted to show people how healthy and beautiful  life is      time had not been lost on the lawn since the beauchenes and seguins  had gone off to visit the stables  first of all there had been a  distribution of the menu cards  which charlotte had adorned with such  delicate water color sketches  this surprise of hers had enraptured  them all at lunch  and they still laughed at the sight of those pretty  children s heads  then  while the servants cleared the table  gregoire  achieved a great success by offering the bride a bouquet of splendid  white roses  which he drew out of a bush where he had hitherto kept it  hidden  he had doubtless been waiting for some absence of his father s   they were the roses of the mill  with therese s assistance he must have  pillaged the bushes in the enclosure  marianne  recognizing how serious  was the transgression  wished to scold him  but what superb white  roses they were  as big as cabbages  as he himself had said  and he was  entitled to triumph over them  for they were the only white roses there   and had been secured by himself  like the wandering urchin he was with  a spice of knight errantry in his composition  quite ready to jump over  walls and cajole damsels in order to deck a bride with snowy blooms      oh  papa won t say anything   he declared  with no little  self assurance   they are far too beautiful      this made the others laugh  but fresh emotion ensued  for benjamin and  guillaume awoke and screamed their hunger aloud  it was gayly remarked   however  that they were quite entitled to their turn of feasting  and as  it was simply a family gathering there was no embarrassment on the part  of the mothers  marianne took benjamin on her knees in the shade of the  oak tree  and charlotte placed herself with guillaume on her right hand   while  on her left  andree seated herself with little leonce  who had  been weaned a week previously  but was still very fond of caresses     it was at this moment that the beauchenes and the seguins reappeared  with mathieu  and stopped short  struck by the charm of the spectacle  before them  between a framework of tall trees  under the patriarchal  oak  on the thick grass of the lawn the whole vigorous family was  gathered in a group  instinct with gayety  beauty  and strength  gervais  and claire  ever active  were  with frederic  hurrying on the servants   who made no end of serving the coffee on the table which had just been  cleared  for this table the three younger girls  half buried in a heap  of flowers  tea and blush and crimson roses  were now  with the help of  knight gregoire  devising new decorations  then  a few paces away  the  bridal pair  denis and marthe  were conversing in undertones  while the  bride s mother  madame desvignes  sat listening to them with a discreet  and infinitely gentle smile upon her lips  and it was in the midst  of all this that marianne  radiant  white of skin  still fresh  ever  beautiful  with serene strength  was giving the breast to her twelfth  child  her benjamin  and smiling at him as he sucked away  while  surrendering her other knee to little nicolas  who was jealous of his  younger brother  and her two daughters in law seemed like a continuation  of herself  there was andree on the left with ambroise  who had stepped  up to tease his little leonce  and charlotte on the right with her two  children  guillaume  who hung on her breast  and berthe  who had  sought a place among her skirts  and here  faith in life had yielded  prosperity  ever increasing  overflowing wealth  all the sovereign  florescence of happy fruitfulness     seguin  addressing himself to marianne  asked her jestingly   and so  that little gentleman is the fourteenth you have nursed      she likewise laughed   no  i mustn t tell fibs  i have nursed twelve   including this one  that is the exact number      beauchene  who had recovered his self possession  could not refrain from  intervening once more   a full dozen  eh  it is madness       i share your opinion   said mathieu  laughing in his turn   at all  events  if it is not madness it is extravagance  as we admit  my wife  and i  when we are alone  and we certainly don t think that all people  ought to have such large families as ours  but  given the situation in  france nowadays  with our population dwindling and that of nearly every  other country increasing  it is hardly possible to complain of even the  largest family  thus  even if our example be exaggerated  it remains an  example  i think  for others to think over      marianne listened  still smiling  but with tears standing in her eyes   a feeling of gentle sadness was penetrating her  her heart wound had  reopened even amid all her joy at seeing her children assembled around  her   yes   said she in a trembling voice   there have been twelve  but  i have only ten left  two are already sleeping yonder  waiting for us  underground      there was no sign of dread  however  in that evocation of the peaceful  little cemetery of janville and the family grave in which all the  children hoped some day to be laid  one after the other  side by side   rather did that evocation  coming amid that gay wedding assembly  seem  like a promise of future blessed peace  the memory of the dear departed  ones remained alive  and lent to one and all a kind of loving gravity  even amid their mirth  was it not impossible to accept life without  accepting death  each came here to perform his task  and then  his work  ended  went to join his elders in that slumber of eternity where the  great fraternity of humankind was fulfilled     but in presence of those jesters  beauchene and seguin  quite a flood  of words rose to mathieu s lips  he would have liked to answer them   he would have liked to triumph over the mendacious theories which they  still dared to assert even in their hour of defeat  to fear that the  earth might become over populated  that excess of life might produce  famine  was this not idiotic  others only had to do as he had done   create the necessary subsistence each time that a child was born to  them  and he would have pointed to chantebled  his work  and to all the  corn growing up under the sun  even as his children grew  they could not  be charged with having come to consume the share of others  since each  was born with his bread before him  and millions of new beings might  follow  for the earth was vast  more than two thirds of it still  remained to be placed under cultivation  and therein lay endless  fertility for unlimited humanity  besides  had not every civilization   every progress  been due to the impulse of numbers  the improvidence  of the poor had alone urged revolutionary multitudes to the conquest of  truth  justice  and happiness  and with each succeeding day the human  torrent would require more kindliness  more equity  the logical division  of wealth by just laws regulating universal labor  if it were true  too   that civilization was a check to excessive natality  this phenomenon  itself might make one hope in final equilibrium in the far off ages   when the earth should be entirely populated and wise enough to live in a  sort of divine immobility  but all this was pure speculation beside  the needs of the hour  the nations which must be built up afresh and  incessantly enlarged  pending the eventual definitive federation of  mankind  and it was really an example  a brave and a necessary one  that  marianne and he were giving  in order that manners and customs  and the  idea of morality and the idea of beauty might be changed     full of these thoughts mathieu was already opening his mouth to speak   but all at once he felt how futile discussion would be in presence of  that admirable scene  that mother surrounded by such a florescence of  vigorous children  that mother nursing yet another child  under the big  oak which she had planted  she was bravely accomplishing her task  that  of perpetuating the world  and hers was the sovereign beauty     mathieu could think of only one thing that would express everything  and  that was to kiss her with all his heart before the whole assembly      there  dear wife  you are the most beautiful and the best  may all the  others do as you have done      then  when marianne had gloriously returned his kiss  there arose an  acclamation  a tempest of merry laughter  they were both of heroic  mould  it was with a great dash of heroism that they had steered their  bark onward  thanks to their full faith in life  their will of action   and the force of their love  and constance was at last conscious of  it  she could realize the conquering power of fruitfulness  she could  already see the froments masters of the factory through their son denis   masters of seguin s mansion through their son ambroise  masters  too  of  all the countryside through their other children  numbers spelt victory   and shrinking  consumed with a love which she could never more satisfy   full of the bitterness of her defeat  though she yet hoped for some  abominable revenge of destiny  she  who never wept   turned aside to  hide the big hot tears which now burnt her withered cheeks     meantime benjamin and guillaume were enjoying themselves like greedy  little men whom nothing could disturb  had there been less laughter  one might have heard the trickling of their mothers  milk  that little  stream flowing forth amid the torrent of sap which upraised the earth  and made the big trees quiver in the powerful july blaze  on every side  fruitful life was conveying germs  creating and nourishing  and for its  eternal work an eternal river of milk flowed through the world           xix    one sunday morning norine and cecile  who  though it was rightly a day  of rest  were  nevertheless  working on either side of their little  table  pressed as they were to deliver boxes for the approaching new  year season  received a visit which left them pale with stupor and  fright     their unknown hidden life had hitherto followed a peaceful course  the  only battle being to make both ends meet every week  and to put by the  rent money for payment every quarter  during the eight years that the  sisters had been living together in the rue de la federation near the  champ de mars  occupying the same big room with cheerful windows  a room  whose coquettish cleanliness made them feel quite proud  norine s child  had grown up steadily between his two affectionate mothers  for he had  ended by confounding them together  there was mamma norine and there  was mamma cecile  and he did not exactly know whether one of the two  was more his mother than the other  it was for him alone that they both  lived and toiled  the one still a fine  good looking woman at forty  years of age  the other yet girlish at thirty     now  at about ten o clock that sunday  there came in succession two  loud knocks at the door  when the latter was opened a short  thick set  fellow  about eighteen  stepped in  he was dark haired  with a square  face  a hard prominent jaw  and eyes of a pale gray  and he wore a  ragged old jacket and a gray cloth cap  discolored by long usage      excuse me   said he   but isn t it here that live mesdames moineaud   who make cardboard boxes      norine stood there looking at him with sudden uneasiness  her heart  had contracted as if she were menaced  she had certainly seen that face  somewhere before  but she could only recall one old time danger  which  suddenly seemed to revive  more formidable than ever  as if threatening  to spoil her quiet life      yes  it is here   she answered     without any haste the young man glanced around the room  he must have  expected more signs of means than he found  for he pouted slightly  then  his eyes rested on the child  who  like a well behaved little boy   had been amusing himself with reading  and had now raised his face  to examine the newcomer  and the latter concluded his examination by  directing a brief glance at the other woman who was present  a slight   sickly creature who likewise felt anxious in presence of that sudden  apparition of the unknown      i was told the left hand door on the fourth floor   the young man  resumed   but  all the same  i was afraid of making a mistake  for  the things i have to say can t be said to everybody  it isn t an easy  matter  and  of course  i thought it well over before i came here      he spoke slowly in a drawling way  and after again making sure that the  other woman was too young to be the one he sought  he kept his pale  eyes steadily fixed on norine  the growing anguish with which he saw  her quivering  the appeal that she was evidently making to her memory   induced him to prolong things for another moment  then he spoke out    i am the child who was put to nurse at rougemont  my name is  alexandre honore      there was no need for him to say anything more  the unhappy norine began  to tremble from head to foot  clasped and wrung her hands  while an  ashen hue came over her distorted features  good heavens  beauchene   yes  it was beauchene whom he resembled  and in so striking a manner   with his eyes of prey  his big jaw which proclaimed an enjoyer consumed  by base voracity  that she was now astonished that she had not been able  to name him at her first glance  her legs failed her  and she had to sit  down      so it s you   said alexandre     as she continued shivering  confessing the truth by her manner  but  unable to articulate a word  to such a point did despair and fright  clutch her at the throat  he felt the need of reassuring her a little   particularly if he was to keep that door open to him      you must not upset yourself like that   said he   you have nothing to  fear from me  it isn t my intention to give you any trouble  only when  i learnt at last where you were i wished to know you  and that was  natural  wasn t it  i even fancied that perhaps you might be pleased to  see me      then  too  the truth is that i m precious badly off  three  years ago i was silly enough to come back to paris  where i do little  more than starve  and on the days when one hasn t breakfasted  one feels  inclined to look up one s parents  even though they may have turned one  into the street  for  all the same  they can hardly be so hard hearted  as to refuse one a plateful of soup      tears rose to norine s eyes  this was the finishing stroke  the return  of that wretched cast off son  that big suspicious looking fellow who  accused her and complained of starving  annoyed at being unable to  elicit from her any response but shivers and sobs  alexandre turned  to cecile   you are her sister  i know   said he   tell her that it s  stupid of her to go on like that  i haven t come to murder her  it s  funny how pleased she is to see me  yet i don t make any noise  and i  said nothing whatever to the door porter downstairs  i assure you      then as cecile  without answering him  rose to go and comfort norine  he  again became interested in the child  who likewise felt frightened and  turned pale on seeing the grief of his two mammas      so that lad is my brother      thereupon norine suddenly sprang to her feet and set herself between  the child and him  a mad fear had come to her of some catastrophe  some  great collapse which would crush them all  yet she did not wish to be  harsh  she even sought kind words  but amid it all she lost her head   carried away by feelings of revolt  rancor  instinctive hostility      you came  i can understand it  but it is so cruel  what can i do  after  so many years one doesn t know one another  one has nothing to say  and   besides  as you can see for yourself  i m not rich      alexandre glanced round the room for the second time   yes  i see   he  answered   and my father  can t you tell me his name      she remained thunderstruck by this question and turned yet paler  while  he continued   because if my father should have any money i should know  very well how to make him give me some  people have no right to fling  children into the gutter like that      all at once norine had seen the past rise up before her  beauchene   the works  and her father  who now had just quitted them owing to his  infirmities  leaving his son victor behind him     and a sort of instinctive prudence came to her at the thought that if  she were to give up beauchene s name she might compromise all her happy  life  since terrible complications might ensue  the dread she felt of  that suspicious looking lad  who reeked of idleness and vice  inspired  her with an idea   your father  he has long been dead   said she     he could have known nothing  have learnt nothing on that point  for  in  presence of the energy of her answer  he expressed no doubt whatever of  her veracity  but contented himself with making a rough gesture which  indicated how angry he felt at seeing his hungry hopes thus destroyed      so i ve got to starve   he growled     norine  utterly distracted  was possessed by one painful desire  a  desire that he might take himself away  and cease torturing her by his  presence  to such a degree did remorse  and pity  and fright  and horror  now wring her bleeding heart  she opened a drawer and took from it a  ten franc piece  her savings for the last three months  with which she  had intended to buy a new year s present for her little boy  and giving  those ten francs to alexandre  she said   listen  i can do nothing for  you  we live all three in this one room  and we scarcely earn our  bread  it grieves me very much to know that you are so unfortunately  circumstanced  but you mustn t rely on me  do as we do  work      he pocketed the ten francs  and remained there for another moment  swaying about  and saying that he had not come for money  and that  he could very well understand things  for his part he always behaved  properly with people when people behaved properly with him  and he  repeated that since she showed herself good natured he had no idea of  creating any scandal  a mother who did what she could performed her  duty  even though she might only give a ten sous piece  then  as he was  at last going off  he inquired   won t you kiss me      she kissed him  but with cold lips and lifeless heart  and the two  smacking kisses which  with noisy affectation  he gave her in return   left her cheeks quivering      and au revoir  eh   said he   although one may be poor and unable  to keep together  each knows now that the other s in the land of the  living  and there is no reason why i shouldn t come up just now and  again to wish you good day when i m passing      when he had at last disappeared long silence fell amid the infinite  distress which his short stay had brought there  norine had again sunk  upon a chair  as if overwhelmed by this catastrophe  cecile had been  obliged to sit down in front of her  for she also was overcome  and  it was she who  amid the mournfulness of that room  which but a little  while ago had held all their happiness  spoke out the first to complain  and express her astonishment      but you did not ask him anything  we know nothing about him   said she    where has he come from  what is he doing  what does he want  and   in particular  how did he manage to discover you  these were the  interesting things to learn       oh  what would you have   replied norine   when he told me his name he  knocked all the strength out of me  i felt as cold as ice  oh  it s  he  there s no doubt of it  you recognized his likeness to his father   didn t you  but you are right  we know nothing  and now we shall always  be living with that threat over our heads  in fear that everything will  crumble down upon us      all her strength  all her courage was gone  and she began to sob   stammering indistinctly   to think of it  a big fellow of eighteen  falling on one like that without a word of warning  and it s quite true  that i don t love him  since i don t even know him  when he kissed me i  felt nothing  i was icy cold  as if my heart were frozen  o god  o god   what trouble to be sure  and how horrid and cruel it all is      then  as her little boy  on seeing her weep  ran up and flung himself   frightened and tearful  against her bosom  she wildly caught him in her  arms   my poor little one  my poor little one  if only you don t suffer  by it  if only my sin doesn t fall on you  ah  that would be a terrible  punishment  really the best course is for folks to behave properly in  life if they don t want to have a lot of trouble afterwards      in the evening the sisters  having grown somewhat calmer  decided that  their best course would be to write to mathieu  norine remembered that  he had called on her a few years previously to ask if alexandre had not  been to see her  he alone knew all the particulars of the business  and  where to obtain information  and  indeed  as soon as the sisters   letter reached him mathieu made haste to call on them in the rue de  la federation  for he was anxious with respect to the effect which any  scandal might have at the works  where beauchene s position was becoming  worse every day  after questioning norine at length  he guessed that  alexandre must have learnt her address through la couteau  though he  could not say precisely how this had come about  at last  after a long  month of discreet researches  conversations with madame menoux  celeste   and la couteau herself  he was able in some measure to explain  things  the alert had certainly come from the inquiry intrusted to the  nurse agent at rougemont  that visit which she had made to the hamlet of  saint pierre in quest of information respecting the lad who was supposed  to be in apprenticeship with montoir the wheelwright  she had talked too  much  said too much  particularly to the other apprentice  that richard   another foundling  and one of such bad instincts  too  that seven months  later he had taken flight  like alexandre  after purloining some money  from his master  then years elapsed  and all trace of them was lost  but  later on  most assuredly they had met one another on the paris pavement   in such wise that the big carroty lad had told the little dark fellow  the whole story how his relatives had caused a search to be made for  him  and perhaps  too  who his mother was  the whole interspersed with  tittle tattle and ridiculous inventions  still this did not explain  everything  and to understand how alexandre had procured his mother s  actual address  mathieu had to presume that he had secured it from la  couteau  whom celeste had acquainted with so many things  indeed  he  learnt at broquette s nurse agency that a short  thickset young man  with pronounced jaw bones had come there twice to speak to la couteau   nevertheless  many points remained unexplained  the whole affair had  taken place amid the tragic  murky gloom of parisian low life  whose  mire it is not healthy to stir  mathieu ended by resting content with  a general notion of the business  for he himself felt frightened at  the charges already hanging over those two young bandits  who lived so  precariously  dragging their idleness and their vices over the pavement  of the great city  and thus all his researches had resulted in but one  consoling certainty  which was that even if norine the mother was known   the father s name and position were certainly not suspected by anybody     when mathieu saw norine again on the subject he terrified her by the few  particulars which he was obliged to give her      oh  i beg you  i beg you  do not let him come again   she pleaded    find some means  prevent him from coming here  it upsets me too  dreadfully to see him      mathieu  of course  could do nothing in this respect  after mature  reflection he realized that the great object of his efforts must be to  prevent alexandre from discovering beauchene  what he had learnt of the  young man was so bad  so dreadful  that he wished to spare constance the  pain and scandal of being blackmailed  he could see her blanching at the  thought of the ignominy of that lad whom she had so passionately  desired to find  and he felt ashamed for her sake  and deemed it more  compassionate and even necessary to bury the secret in the silence of  the grave  still  it was only after a long fight with himself that he  came to this decision  for he felt that it was hard to have to abandon  the unhappy youth in the streets  was it still possible to save him  he  doubted it  and besides  who would undertake the task  who would know  how to instil honest principles into that waif by teaching him to work   it all meant yet another man cast overboard  forsaken amid the tempest   and mathieu s heart bled at the thought of condemning him  though he  could think of no reasonable means of salvation      my opinion   he said to norine   is that you should keep his father s  name from him for the present  later on we will see  but just now i  should fear worry for everybody      she eagerly acquiesced   oh  you need not be anxious   she responded    i have already told him that his father is dead  if i were to speak out  everything would fall on my shoulders  and my great desire is to be left  in peace in my corner with my little one      with sorrowful mien mathieu continued reflecting  unable to make up his  mind to utterly abandon the young man   if he would only work  i would  find him some employment  and i would even take him on at the farm  later  when i should no longer have cause to fear that he might  contaminate my people  however  i will see what can be done  i know a  wheelwright who would doubtless employ him  and i will write to you in  order that you may tell him where to apply  when he comes back to see  you       what  when he comes back   she cried in despair   so you think that he  will come back  o god  o god  i shall never be happy again      he did  indeed  come back  but when she gave him the wheelwright s  address he sneered and shrugged his shoulders  he knew all about the  paris wheelwrights  a set of sweaters  a parcel of lazy rogues  who made  poor people toil and moil for them  besides  he had never finished his  apprenticeship  he was only fit for running errands  in which capacity  he was willing to accept a post in a large shop  when mathieu had  procured him such a situation  he did not remain in it a fortnight  one  fine evening he disappeared with the parcels of goods which he had been  told to deliver  in turn he tried to learn a baker s calling  became  a mason s hodman  secured work at the markets  but without ever fixing  himself anywhere  he simply discouraged his protector  and left all  sorts of roguery behind him for others to liquidate  it became necessary  to renounce the hope of saving him  when he turned up  as he did  periodically  emaciated  hungry  and in rags  they had to limit  themselves to providing him with the means to buy a jacket and some  bread     thus norine lived on in a state of mortal disquietude  for long weeks  alexandre seemed to be dead  but she  nevertheless  started at the  slightest sound that she heard on the landing  she always felt him to  be there  and whenever he suddenly rapped on the door she recognized his  heavy knock and began to tremble as if he had come to beat her  he had  noticed how his presence reduced the unhappy woman to a state of abject  terror  and he profited by this to extract from her whatever little  sums she hid away  when she had handed him the five franc piece which  mathieu  as a rule  left with her for this purpose  the young rascal  was not content  but began searching for more  at times he made his  appearance in a wild  haggard state  declaring that he should certainly  be sent to prison that evening if he did not secure ten francs  and  talking the while of smashing everything in the room or else of carrying  off the little clock in order to sell it  and it was then necessary for  cecile to intervene and turn him out of the place  for  however puny  she might be  she had a brave heart  but if he went off it was only to  return a few days later with fresh demands  threatening that he would  shout his story to everybody on the stairs if the ten francs were not  given to him  one day  when his mother had no money in the place and  began to weep  he talked of ripping up the mattress  where  said he  she  probably kept her hoard  briefly  the sisters  little home was becoming  a perfect hell     the greatest misfortune of all  however  was that in the rue de la  federation alexandre made the acquaintance of alfred  norine s youngest  brother  the last born of the moineaud family  he was then twenty   and thus two years the senior of his nephew  no worse prowler than he  existed  he was the genuine rough  with pale  beardless face  blinking  eyes  and twisted mouth  the real gutter weed that sprouts up amid the  parisian manure heaps  at seven years of age he robbed his sisters   beating cecile every saturday in order to tear her earnings from her   mother moineaud  worn out with hard work and unable to exercise a  constant watch over him  had never managed to make him attend school  regularly  or to keep him in apprenticeship  he exasperated her to such  a degree that she herself ended by turning him into the streets in order  to secure a little peace and quietness at home  his big brothers kicked  him about  his father was at work from morning till evening  and the  child  thus morally a waif  grew up out of doors for a career of vice  and crime among the swarms of lads and girls of his age  who all rotted  there together like apples fallen on the ground  and as alfred grew he  became yet more corrupt  he was like the sacrificed surplus of a poor  man s family  the surplus poured into the gutter  the spoilt fruit which  spoils all that comes into contact with it     like alexandre  too  he nowadays only lived chancewise  and it was not  even known where he had been sleeping  since mother moineaud had died at  a hospital exhausted by her long life of wretchedness and family cares  which had proved far too heavy for her  she was only sixty at the  time of her death  but was as bent and as worn out as a centenarian   moineaud  two years older  bent like herself  his legs twisted by  paralysis  a lamentable wreck after fifty years of unjust toil  had been  obliged to quit the factory  and thus the home was empty  and its few  poor sticks had been cast to the four winds of heaven     moineaud fortunately received a little pension  for which he was  indebted to denis s compassionate initiative  but he was sinking into  second childhood  worn out by his long and constant efforts  and not  only did he squander his few coppers in drink  but he could not be left  alone  for his feet were lifeless  and his hands shook to such a degree  that he ran the risk of setting all about him on fire whenever he tried  to light his pipe  at last he found himself stranded in the home of his  daughters  norine and cecile  the only two who had heart enough to take  him in  they rented a little closet for him  on the fifth floor of the  house  over their own room  and they nursed him and bought him food and  clothes with his pension money  to which they added a good deal of their  own  as they remarked in their gay  courageous way  they now had two  children  a little one and a very old one  which was a heavy burden  for two women who earned but five francs a day  although they were ever  making boxes from morn till night  there was a touch of soft irony in  the circumstance that old moineaud should have been unable to find any  other refuge than the home of his daughter norine  that daughter whom he  had formerly turned away and cursed for her misconduct  that hussy who  had dishonored him  but whose very hands he now kissed when  for fear  lest he should set the tip of his nose ablaze  she helped him to light  his pipe     all the same  the shaky old nest of the moineauds was destroyed  and the  whole family had flown off  dispersed chancewise  irma alone  thanks  to her fine marriage with a clerk  lived happily  playing the part of a  lady  and so full of vanity that she no longer condescended to see her  brothers and sisters  victor  meantime  was leading at the factory much  the same life as his father had led  working at the same mill as the  other  and in the same blind  stubborn way  he had married  and though  he was under six and thirty  he already had six children  three boys and  three girls  so that his wife seemed fated to much the same existence  as his mother la moineaude  both of them would finish broken down  and  their children in their turn would unconsciously perpetuate the swarming  and accursed starveling race     at euphrasie s  destiny the inevitable showed itself more tragic still   the wretched woman had not been lucky enough to die  she had gradually  become bedridden  quite unable to move  though she lived on and could  hear and see and understand things  from that open grave  her bed  she  had beheld the final break up of what remained of her sorry home  she  was nothing more than a thing  insulted by her husband and tortured by  madame joseph  who would leave her for days together without water  and  fling her occasional crusts much as they might be flung to a sick animal  whose litter is not even changed  terror stricken  and full of humility  amid her downfall  euphrasie resigned herself to everything  but the  worst was that her three children  her twin daughters and her son  being  abandoned to themselves  sank into vice  the all corrupting life of the  streets  benard  tired out  distracted by the wreck of his home  had  taken to drinking with madame joseph  and afterwards they would fight  together  break the furniture  and drive off the children  who came home  muddy  in rags  and with their pockets full of stolen things  on two  occasions benard disappeared for a week at a time  on the third he did  not come back at all  when the rent fell due  madame joseph in her turn  took herself off  and then came the end  euphrasie had to be removed  to the hospital of la salpetriere  the last refuge of the aged and the  infirm  while the children  henceforth without a home in name  were  driven into the gutter  the boy never turned up again  it was as if he  had been swallowed by some sewer  one of the twin girls  found in the  streets  died in a hospital during the ensuing year  and the other   toinette  a fair haired scraggy hussy  who  however puny she might look   was a terrible little creature with the eyes and the teeth of a wolf   lived under the bridges  in the depths of the stone quarries  in the  dingy garrets of haunts of vice  so that at sixteen she was already an  expert thief  her fate was similar to alfred s  here was a girl morally  abandoned  then contaminated by the life of the streets  and carried off  to a criminal career  and  indeed  the uncle and the niece having met  by chance  ended by consorting together  their favorite refuge  it was  thought  being the limekilns in the direction of les moulineaux     one day then it happened that alexandre upon calling at norine s there  encountered alfred  who came at times to try to extract a half franc  from old moineaud  his father  the two young bandits went off together   chatted  and met again  and from that chance encounter there sprang a  band  alexandre was living with richard  and alfred brought toinette  to them  thus they were four in number  and the customary developments  followed  begging at first  the girl putting out her hand at the  instigation of the three prowlers  who remained on the watch and drew  alms by force at nighttime from belated bourgeois encountered in dark  corners  next came vulgar vice and its wonted attendant  blackmail   and then theft  petty larceny to begin with  the pilfering of things  displayed for sale by shopkeepers  and afterwards more serious affairs   premeditated expeditions  mapped out like real war plans     the band slept wherever it could  now in suspicious dingy doss houses   now on waste ground  in summer time there were endless saunters through  the woods of the environs  pending the arrival of night  which handed  paris over to their predatory designs  they found themselves at the  central markets  among the crowds on the boulevards  in the low  taverns  along the deserted avenues  indeed  wherever they sniffed the  possibility of a stroke of luck  the chance of snatching the bread of  idleness  or the pleasures of vice  they were like a little clan of  savages on the war path athwart civilization  living outside the pale of  the laws  they suggested young wild beasts beating the ancestral forest   they typified the human animal relapsing into barbarism  forsaken since  birth  and evincing the ancient instincts of pillage and carnage  and  like noxious weeds they grew up sturdily  becoming bolder and bolder  each day  exacting a bigger and bigger ransom from the fools who toiled  and moiled  ever extending their thefts and marching along the road to  murder     never should it be forgotten that the child  born chancewise  and then  cast upon the pavement  without supervision  without prop or help  rots  there and becomes a terrible ferment of social decomposition  all those  little ones thrown to the gutter  like superfluous kittens are flung  into some sewer  all those forsaken ones  those wanderers of the  pavement who beg  and thieve  and indulge in vice  form the dung heap in  which the worst crimes germinate  childhood left to wretchedness breeds  a fearful nucleus of infection in the tragic gloom of the depths of  paris  those who are thus imprudently cast into the streets yield a  harvest of brigandage  that frightful harvest of evil which makes all  society totter     when norine  through the boasting of alexandre and alfred  who took  pleasure in astonishing her  began to suspect the exploits of the band   she felt so frightened that she had a strong bolt placed upon her door   and when night had fallen she no longer admitted any visitor until she  knew his name  her torture had been lasting for nearly two years  she  was ever quivering with alarm at the thought of alexandre rushing in  upon her some dark night  he was twenty now  he spoke authoritatively   and threatened her with atrocious revenge whenever he had to retire  with empty hands  one day  in spite of cecile  he threw himself upon  the wardrobe and carried off a bundle of linen  handkerchiefs  towels   napkins  and sheets  intending to sell them  and the sisters did not  dare to pursue him down the stairs  despairing  weeping  overwhelmed by  it all  they had sunk down upon their chairs     that winter proved a very severe one  and the two poor workwomen   pillaged in this fashion  would have perished in their sorry home of  cold and starvation  together with the dear child for whom they still  did their best  had it not been for the help which their old friend   madame angelin  regularly brought them  she was still a lady delegate  of the poor relief service  and continued to watch over the children of  unhappy mothers in that terrible district of grenelle  whose poverty is  so great  but for a long time past she had been unable to do anything  officially for norine  if she still brought her a twenty franc piece  every month  it was because charitable people intrusted her with fairly  large amounts  knowing that she could distribute them to advantage in  the dreadful inferno which her functions compelled her to frequent   she set her last joy and found the great consolation of her desolate   childless life in thus remitting alms to poor mothers whose little ones  laughed at her joyously as soon as they saw her arrive with her hands  full of good things     one day when the weather was frightful  all rain and wind  madame  angelin lingered for a little while in norine s room  it was barely two  o clock in the afternoon  and she was just beginning her round  on her  lap lay her little bag  bulging out with the gold and the silver which  she had to distribute  old moineaud was there  installed on a chair  and smoking his pipe  in front of her  and she felt concerned about  his needs  and explained that she would have greatly liked to obtain a  monthly relief allowance for him      but if you only knew   she added   what suffering there is among the  poor during these winter months  we are quite swamped  we cannot give to  everybody  there are too many  and after all you are among the fortunate  ones  i find some lying like dogs on the tiled floors of their rooms   without a scrap of coal to make a fire or even a potato to eat  and  the poor children  too  good heavens  children in heaps among vermin   without shoes  without clothes  all growing up as if destined for prison  or the scaffold  unless consumption should carry them off      madame angelin quivered and closed her eyes as if to escape  the spectacle of all the terrifying things that she evoked  the  wretchedness  the shame  the crimes that she elbowed during her  continual perambulations through that hell of poverty  vice  and hunger   she often returned home pale and silent  having reached the uttermost  depths of human abomination  and never daring to say all  at times  she trembled and raised her eyes to heaven  wondering what vengeful  cataclysm would swallow up that accursed city of paris      ah   she murmured once more   their sufferings are so great  may their  sins be forgiven them      moineaud listened to her in a state of stupor  as if he were unable to  understand  at last with difficulty he succeeded in taking his pipe  from his mouth  it was  indeed  quite an effort now for him to do such  a thing  and yet for fifty years he had wrestled with iron  iron in the  vice or on the anvil      there is nothing like good conduct   he stammered huskily   when a man  works he s rewarded      then he wished to set his pipe between his lips once more  but was  unable to do so  his hand  deformed by the constant use of tools   trembled too violently  so it became necessary for norine to rise from  her chair and help him      poor father   exclaimed cecile  who had not ceased working  cutting out  the cardboard for the little boxes she made   what would have become  of him if we had not given him shelter  it isn t irma  with her stylish  hats and her silk dresses who would have cared to have him at her  place      meantime norine s little boy had taken his stand in front of madame  angelin  for he knew very well that  on the days when the good lady  called  there was some dessert at supper in the evening  he smiled at  her with the bright eyes which lit up his pretty fair face  crowned with  tumbled sunshiny hair  and when she noticed with what a merry glance he  was waiting for her to open her little bag  she felt quite moved      come and kiss me  my little friend   said she     she knew no sweeter reward for all that she did than the kisses of the  children in the poor homes whither she brought a little joy  when the  youngster had boldly thrown his arms round her neck  her eyes filled  with tears  and  addressing herself to his mother  she repeated   no   no  you must not complain  there are others who are more unhappy than  you  i know one who if this pretty little fellow could only be her  own would willingly accept your poverty  and paste boxes together from  morning till night and lead a recluse s life in this one room  which  he suffices to fill with sunshine  ah  good heavens  if you were only  willing  if we could only change      for a moment she became silent  afraid that she might burst into sobs   the wound dealt her by her childlessness had always remained open  she  and her husband were now growing old in bitter solitude in three little  rooms overlooking a courtyard in the rue de lille  in this retirement  they subsisted on the salary which she  the wife  received as a  lady delegate  joined to what they had been able to save of their  original fortune  the former fan painter of triumphant mien was now  completely blind  a mere thing  a poor suffering thing  whom his wife  seated every morning in an armchair where she still found him in the  evening when she returned home from her incessant peregrinations through  the frightful misery of guilty mothers and martyred children  he could  no longer eat  he could no longer go to bed without her help  he had  only her left him  he was her child as he would say at times with a  despairing irony which made them both weep     a child  ah  yes  she had ended by having one  and it was he  an old  child  born of disaster  one who appeared to be eighty though he was  less than fifty years old  and who amid his black and ceaseless night  ever dreamt of sunshine during the long hours which he was compelled to  spend alone  and madame angelin did not only envy that poor workwoman  her little boy  she also envied her that old man smoking his pipe  yonder  that infirm relic of labor who at all events saw clearly and  still lived      don t worry the lady   said norine to her son  for she felt anxious   quite moved indeed  at seeing the other so disturbed  with her heart so  full   run away and play      she had learnt a little of madame angelin s sad story from mathieu   and with the deep gratitude which she felt towards her benefactress  was blended a sort of impassioned respect  which rendered her timid and  deferent each time that she saw her arrive  tall and distinguished   ever clad in black  and showing the remnants of her former beauty which  sorrow had wrecked already  though she was barely six and forty years  of age  for norine  the lady delegate was like some queen who had fallen  from her throne amid frightful and undeserved sufferings      run away  go and play  my darling   norine repeated to her boy   you  are tiring madame       tiring me  oh no   exclaimed madame angelin  conquering her emotion    on the contrary  he does me good  kiss me  kiss me again  my pretty  fellow      then she began to bestir and collect herself      well  it is getting late  and i have so many places to go to between  now and this evening  this is what i can do for you      she was at last taking a gold coin from her little bag  but at that very  moment a heavy blow  as if dealt by a fist  resounded on the door  and  norine turned ghastly pale  for she had recognized alexandre s brutal  knock  what could she do  if she did not open the door  the bandit would  go on knocking  and raise a scandal  she was obliged to open it  but  things did not take the violent tragical turn which she had feared   surprised at seeing a lady there  alexandre did not even open his mouth   he simply slipped inside  and stationed himself bolt upright against  the wall  the lady delegate had raised her eyes and then carried them  elsewhere  understanding that this young fellow must be some friend   probably some relative  and without thought of concealment  she went on      here are twenty francs  i can t do more  only i promise you that i will  try to double the amount next month  it will be the rent month  and i ve  already applied for help on all sides  and people have promised to  give me the utmost they can  but shall i ever have enough  so many  applications are made to me      her little bag had remained open on her knees  and alexandre  with his  glittering eyes  was searching it  weighing in fancy all the treasure of  the poor that it contained  all the gold and silver and even the copper  money that distended its sides  still in silence  he watched madame  angelin as she closed it  slipped its little chain round her wrist  and  then finally rose from her chair      well  au revoir  till next month then   she resumed   i shall certainly  call on the  th  and in all probability i shall begin my round with you   but it s possible that it may be rather late in the afternoon  for  it happens to be my poor husband s name day  and so be brave and work  well      norine and cecile had likewise risen  in order to escort her to the  door  here again there was an outpouring of gratitude  and the child  once more kissed the good lady on both cheeks with all his little heart   the sisters  so terrified by alexandre s arrival  at last began to  breathe again     in point of fact the incident terminated fairly well  for the young man  showed himself accommodating  when cecile returned from obtaining  change for the gold  he contented himself with taking one of the four  five franc pieces which she brought up with her  and he did not tarry to  torture them as was his wont  but immediately went off with the money he  had levied  whistling the while the air of a hunting song     the  th of the ensuing month  a saturday  was one of the gloomiest   most rainy days of that wretched  mournful winter  darkness fell rapidly  already at three o clock in the afternoon  and it became almost night   at the deserted end of rue de la federation there was an expanse of  waste ground  a building site  for long years enclosed by a fence  which  dampness had ended by rotting  some of the boards were missing  and at  one part there was quite a breach  all through that afternoon  in spite  of the constantly recurring downpours  a scraggy girl remained stationed  near that breach  wrapped to her eyes in the ragged remnants of an  old shawl  doubtless for protection against the cold  she seemed to  be waiting for some chance meeting  the advent it might be of some  charitably disposed wayfarer  and her impatience was manifest  for  while keeping close to the fence like some animal lying in wait  she  continually peered through the breach  thrusting out her tapering  weasel s head and watching yonder  in the direction of the champ de  mars     hours went by  three o clock struck  and then such dark clouds rolled  over the livid sky  that the girl herself became blurred  obscured  as  if she were some mere piece of wreckage cast into the darkness  at times  she raised her head and watched the sky darken  with eyes that glittered  as if to thank it for throwing so dense a gloom over that deserted  corner  that spot so fit for an ambuscade  and just as the rain had once  more begun to fall  a lady could be seen approaching  a lady clad in  black  quite black  under an open umbrella  while seeking to avoid the  puddles in her path  she walked on quickly  like one in a hurry  who  goes about her business on foot in order to save herself the expense of  a cab     from some precise description which she had obtained  toinette  the  girl  appeared to recognize this lady from afar off  she was indeed none  other than madame angelin  coming quickly from the rue de lille  on her  way to the homes of her poor  with the little chain of her little bag  encircling her wrist  and when the girl espied the gleaming steel of  that little chain  she no longer had any doubts  but whistled softly   and forthwith cries and moans arose from a dim corner of the vacant  ground  while she herself began to wail and call distressfully     astonished  disturbed by it all  madame angelin stopped short      what is the matter  my girl   she asked      oh  madame  my brother has fallen yonder and broken his leg       what  fallen  what has he fallen from       oh  madame  there s a shed yonder where we sleep  because we haven t  any home  and he was using an old ladder to try to prevent the rain from  pouring in on us  and he fell and broke his leg      thereupon the girl burst into sobs  asking what was to become of them   stammering that she had been standing there in despair for the last ten  minutes  but could see nobody to help them  which was not surprising  with that terrible rain falling and the cold so bitter  and while she  stammered all this  the calls for help and the cries of pain became  louder in the depths of the waste ground     though madame angelin was terribly upset  she nevertheless hesitated  as  if distrustful      you must run to get a doctor  my poor child   said she   i can do  nothing       oh  but you can  madame  come with me  i pray you  i don t know where  there s a doctor to be found  come with me  and we will pick him up   for i can t manage it by myself  and at all events we can lay him in the  shed  so that the rain sha n t pour down on him      this time the good woman consented  so truthful did the girl s accents  seem to be  constant visits to the vilest dens  where crime sprouted  from the dunghill of poverty  had made madame angelin brave  she was  obliged to close her umbrella when she glided through the breach in the  fence in the wake of the girl  who  slim and supple like a cat  glided  on in front  bareheaded  in her ragged shawl      give me your hand  madame   said she   take care  for there are some  trenches     it s over yonder at the end  can you hear how he s moaning   poor brother     ah  here we are      then came swift and overwhelming savagery  the three bandits  alexandre   richard  and alfred  who had been crouching low  sprang forward and  threw themselves upon madame angelin with such hungry  wolfish violence  that she was thrown to the ground  alfred  however  being a coward  then  left her to the two others  and hastened with toinette to the breach in  order to keep watch  alexandre  who had a handkerchief rolled up  all  ready  thrust it into the poor lady s mouth to stifle her cries  their  intention was to stun her only and then make off with her little bag     but the handkerchief must have slipped out  for she suddenly raised a  shriek  a loud and terrible shriek  and at that moment the others near  the breach gave the alarm whistle  some people were  doubtless  drawing  near  it was necessary to finish  alexandre knotted the handkerchief  round the unhappy woman s neck  while richard with his fist forced her  shriek back into her throat  red madness fell upon them  they both began  to twist and tighten the handkerchief  and dragged the poor creature  over the muddy ground until she stirred no more  then  as the whistle  sounded again  they took the bag  left the body there with the  handkerchief around the neck  and galloped  all four of them  as far  as the grenelle bridge  whence they flung the bag into the seine  after  greedily thrusting the coppers  and the white silver  and the yellow  gold into their pockets     when mathieu read the particulars of the crime in the newspapers  he  was seized with fright and hastened to the rue de la federation  the  murdered woman had been promptly identified  and the circumstance that  the crime had been committed on that plot of vacant ground but a hundred  yards or so from the house where norine and cecile lived upset him   filled him with a terrible presentiment  and he immediately realized  that his fears were justified when he had to knock three times at  norine s door before cecile  having recognized his voice  removed the  articles with which it had been barricaded  and admitted him inside   norine was in bed  quite ill  and as white as her sheets  she began to  sob and shuddered repeatedly as she told him the story  madame angelin s  visit the previous month  and the sudden arrival of alexandre  who had  seen the bag and had heard the promise of further help  at a certain  hour on a certain date  besides  norine could have no doubts  for  the handkerchief found round the victim s neck was one of hers which  alexandre had stolen  a handkerchief embroidered with the initial  letters of her christian name  one of those cheap fancy things which  are sold by thousands at the big linendrapery establishments  that  handkerchief  too  was the only clew to the murderers  and it was such  a very vague one that the police were still vainly seeking the culprits   quite lost amid a variety of scents and despairing of success     mathieu sat near the bed listening to norine and feeling icy cold  good  god  that poor  unfortunate madame angelin  he could picture her in her  younger days  so gay and bright over yonder at janville  roaming the  woods there in the company of her husband  the pair of them losing  themselves among the deserted paths  and lingering in the discreet shade  of the pollard willows beside the yeuse  where their love kisses sounded  beneath the branches like the twittering of song birds  and he could  picture her at a later date  already too severely punished for her lack  of foresight  in despair at remaining childless  and bowed down with  grief as by slow degrees her husband became blind  and night fell upon  the little happiness yet left to them  and all at once mathieu also  pictured that wretched blind man  on the evening when he vainly awaited  the return of his wife  in order that she might feed him and put him to  bed  old child that he was  now motherless  forsaken  forever alone in  his dark night  in which he could only see the bloody spectre of his  murdered helpmate  ah  to think of it  so bright a promise of radiant  life  followed by such destiny  such death      we did right   muttered mathieu  as his thoughts turned to constance    we did right to keep that ruffian in ignorance of his father s name   what a terrible thing  we must bury the secret as deeply as possible  within us      norine shuddered once more      oh  have no fear   she answered   i would die rather than speak      months  years  flowed by  and never did the police discover the  murderers of the lady with the little bag  for years  too  norine  shuddered every time that anybody knocked too roughly at her door  but  alexandre did not reappear there  he doubtless feared that corner of  the rue de la federation  and remained as it were submerged in the dim  unsoundable depths of the ocean of paris           xx    during the ten years which followed  the vigorous sprouting of the  froments  suggestive of some healthy vegetation of joy and strength   continued in and around the ever and ever richer domain of chantebled   as the sons and the daughters grew up there came fresh marriages  and  more and more children  all the promised crop  all the promised swarming  of a race of conquerors     first it was gervais who married caroline boucher  daughter of a big  farmer of the region  a fair  fine featured  gay  strong girl  one of  those superior women born to rule over a little army of servants  on  leaving a parisian boarding school she had been sensible enough to feel  no shame of her family s connection with the soil  indeed she loved the  earth and had set herself to win from it all the sterling happiness of  her life  by way of dowry she brought an expanse of meadow land in  the direction of lillebonne  which enlarged the estate by some seventy  acres  but she more particularly brought her good humor  her health  her  courage in rising early  in watching over the farmyard  the dairy  the  whole home  like an energetic active housewife  who was ever bustling  about  and always the last to bed     then came the turn of claire  whose marriage with frederic berthaud   long since foreseen  ended by taking place  there were tears of soft  emotion  for the memory of her whom berthaud had loved and whom he was  to have married disturbed several hearts on the wedding day when the  family skirted the little cemetery of janville as it returned to the  farm from the municipal offices  but  after all  did not that love of  former days  that faithful fellow s long affection  which in time had  become transferred to the younger sister  constitute as it were another  link in the ties which bound him to the froments  he had no fortune   he brought with him only his constant faithfulness  and the fraternity  which had sprung up between himself and gervais during the many seasons  when they had ploughed the estate like a span of tireless oxen drawing  the same plough  his heart was one that could never be doubted  he was  the helper who had become indispensable  the husband whose advent would  mean the best of all understandings and absolute certainty of happiness     from the day of that wedding the government of the farm was finally  settled  though mathieu was barely five and fifty he abdicated  and  transferred his authority to gervais  that son of the earth as with a  laugh he often called him  the first of his children born at chantebled   the one who had never left the farm  and who had at all times given him  the support of his arm and his brain and his heart  and now frederic  in turn would think and strive as gervais s devoted lieutenant  in  the great common task  between them henceforth they would continue the  father s work  and perfect the system of culture  procuring appliances  of new design from the beauchene works  now ruled by denis  and ever  drawing from the soil the largest crops that it could be induced to  yield  their wives had likewise divided their share of authority  claire  surrendered the duties of supervision to caroline  who was stronger and  more active than herself  and was content to attend to the accounts  the  turnover of considerable sums of money  all that was paid away and all  that was received  the two couples seemed to have been expressly and  cleverly selected to complete one another and to accomplish the greatest  sum of work without ever the slightest fear of conflict  and  indeed   they lived in perfect union  with only one will among them  one purpose  which was ever more and more skilfully effected  the continual increase  of the happiness and wealth of chantebled under the beneficent sun     at the same time  if mathieu had renounced the actual exercise of  authority  he none the less remained the creator  the oracle who was  consulted  listened to  and obeyed  he dwelt with marianne in the  old shooting box which had been transformed and enlarged into a very  comfortable house  here they lived like the founders of a dynasty who  had retired in full glory  setting their only delight in beholding  around them the development and expansion of their race  the birth and  growth of their children s children  leaving claire and gervais on one  side  there were as yet only denis and ambroise  the first to wing their  flight abroad  engaged in building up their fortunes in paris  the three  girls  louise  madeleine  and marguerite  who would soon be old enough  to marry  still dwelt in the happy home beside their parents  as well  as the three youngest boys  gregoire  the free lance  nicolas  the most  stubborn and determined of the brood  and benjamin  who was of a dreamy  nature  all these finished growing up at the edge of the nest  so to  say  with the window of life open before them  ready for the day when  they likewise would take wing     with them dwelt charlotte  blaise s widow  and her two children  berthe  and guillaume  the three of them occupying an upper floor of the house  where the mother had installed her studio  she was becoming rich since  her little share in the factory profits  stipulated by denis  had been  increasing year by year  but nevertheless  she continued working for  her dealer in miniatures  this work brought her pocket money  she gayly  said  and would enable her to make her children a present whenever they  might marry  there was  indeed  already some thought of berthe  marrying  and assuredly she would be the first of mathieu and marianne s  grandchildren to enter into the state of matrimony  they smiled softly  at the idea of becoming great grandparents before very long perhaps     after the lapse of four years  gregoire  first of the younger children   flew away  there was a great deal of trouble  quite a little drama in  connection with the affair  which mathieu and marianne had for some  time been anticipating  gregoire was anything but reasonable  short  but  robust  with a pert face in which glittered the brightest of eyes  he  had always been the turbulent member of the family  the one who caused  the most anxiety  his childhood had been spent in playing truant in  the woods of janville  and he had afterwards made a mere pretence of  studying in paris  returning home full of health and spirits  but unable  or unwilling to make up his mind with respect to any particular trade  or profession  already four and twenty  he knew little more than how  to shoot and fish  and trot about the country on horseback  he was  certainly not more stupid or less active than another  but he seemed  bent on living and amusing himself according to his fancy  the worst was  that for some months past all the gossips of janville had been  relating that he had renewed his former boyish friendship with therese  lepailleur  the miller s daughter  and that they were to be met of an  evening in shady nooks under the pollard willows by the yeuse     one morning mathieu  wishing to ascertain if the young coveys of  partridges were plentiful in the direction of mareuil  took gregoire  with him  and when they found themselves alone among the plantations of  the plateau  he began to talk to him seriously      you know i m not pleased with you  my lad   said he   i really cannot  understand the idle life which you lead here  while all the rest of us  are hard at work  i shall wait till october since you have positively  promised me that you will then come to a decision and choose the calling  which you most fancy  but what is all this tittle tattle which i hear  about appointments which you keep with the daughter of the lepailleurs   do you wish to cause us serious worry      gregoire quietly began to laugh      oh  father  you are surely not going to scold a son of yours because  he happens to be on friendly terms with a pretty girl  why  as you may  remember  it was i who gave her her first bicycle lesson nearly ten  years ago  and you will recollect the fine white roses which she helped  me to secure in the enclosure by the mill for denis  wedding      gregoire still laughed at the memory of that incident  and lived afresh  through all his old time sweethearting  the escapades with therese along  the river banks  and the banquets of blackberries in undiscoverable  hiding places  deep in the woods  and it seemed  too  that the love  of childhood had revived  and was now bursting into consuming fire  so  vividly did his cheeks glow  and so hotly did his eyes blaze as he thus  recalled those distant times      poor therese  we had been at daggers drawn for years  and all because  one evening  on coming back from the fair at vieux bourg  i pushed her  into a pool of water where she dirtied her frock  it s true that last  spring we made it up again on finding ourselves face to face in the  little wood at monval over yonder  but come  father  do you mean to  say that it s a crime if we take a little pleasure in speaking to one  another when we meet      rendered the more anxious by the fire with which gregoire sought to  defend the girl  mathieu spoke out plainly      a crime  no  if you just wish one another good day and good evening   only folks relate that you are to be seen at dusk with your arms  round each other s waist  and that you go stargazing through the grass  alongside the yeuse      then  as gregoire this time without replying laughed yet more loudly   with the merry laugh of youth  his father gravely resumed      listen  my lad  it is not at all to my taste to play the gendarme  behind my sons  but i won t have you drawing some unpleasant business  with the lepailleurs on us all  you know the position  they would  be delighted to give us trouble  so don t give them occasion for  complaining  leave their daughter alone       oh  i take plenty of care   cried the young man  thus suddenly  confessing the truth   poor girl  she has already had her ears boxed  because somebody told her father that i had been met with her  he  answered that rather than give her to me he would throw her into the  river       ah  you see   concluded mathieu   it is understood  is it not  i shall  rely on your good behavior      thereupon they went their way  scouring the fields as far as the road to  mareuil  coveys of young partridges  still weak on the wing  started up  both to the right and to the left  the shooting would be good  then as  the father and the son turned homeward  slackening their pace  a long  spell of silence fell between them  they were both reflecting      i don t wish that there should be any misunderstanding between us    mathieu suddenly resumed   you must not imagine that i shall prevent you  from marrying according to your tastes and that i shall require you to  take an heiress  our poor blaise married a portionless girl  and it  was the same with denis  besides which i gave your sister  claire  in  marriage to frederic  who was simply one of our farm hands  so i don t  look down on therese  on the contrary  i think her charming  she s one  of the prettiest girls of the district  not tall  certainly  but so  alert and determined  with her little pink face shining under such a  wild crop of fair hair  that one might think her powdered with all the  flour in the mill       yes  isn t that so  father   interrupted gregoire enthusiastically    and if you only knew how affectionate and courageous she is  she s  worth a man any day  it s wrong of them to smack her  for she will never  put up with it  whenever she sets her mind on anything she s bound to do  it  and it isn t i who can prevent her      absorbed in some reflections of his own  mathieu scarcely heard his son      no  no   he resumed   i certainly don t look down on their mill  if it  were not for lepailleur s stupid obstinacy he would be drawing a fortune  from that mill nowadays  since corn growing has again been taken up all  over the district  thanks to our victory  he might have got a good pile  of crowns together if he had simply changed the old mechanism of his  wheel which he leaves rotting under the moss  and better still  i should  like to see a good engine there  and a bit of a light railway line  connecting the mill with janville station      in this fashion he continued explaining his ideas while gregoire  listened  again quite lively and taking things in a jesting way      well  father   the young man ended by saying   as you wish that i  should have a calling  it s settled  if i marry therese  i ll be a  miller      mathieu protested in surprise   no  no  i was merely talking  and  besides  you have promised me  my lad  that you will be reasonable  so  once again  for the sake of the peace and quietness of all of us   leave therese alone  for we can only expect to reap worry with the  lepailleurs      the conversation ceased and they returned to the farm  that evening   however  the father told the mother of the young man s confession  and  she  who already entertained various misgivings  felt more anxious than  ever  still a month went by without anything serious happening     then  one morning marianne was astounded at finding gregoire s bedroom  empty  as a rule he came to kiss her  perhaps he had risen early  and  had gone on some excursion in the environs  but she trembled slightly  when she remembered how lovingly he had twice caught her in his arms on  the previous night when they were all retiring to bed  and as she looked  inquisitively round the room she noticed on the mantelshelf a letter  addressed to her  a prettily worded letter in which the young fellow  begged her to forgive him for causing her grief  and asked her to excuse  him with his father  for it was necessary that he should leave them  for a time  of his reasons for doing so and his purpose  however  no  particulars were given     this family rending  this bad conduct on the part of the son who had  been the most spoilt of all  and who  in a fit of sudden folly was the  first to break the ties which united the household together  was a very  painful blow for marianne and mathieu  they were the more terrified  since they divined that gregoire had not gone off alone  they pieced  together the incidents of the deplorable affair  charlotte remembered  that she had heard gregoire go downstairs again  almost immediately  after entering his bedroom  and before the servants had even bolted the  house doors for the night  he had certainly rushed off to join therese  in some coppice  whence they must have hurried away to vieux bourg  station which the last train to paris quitted at five and twenty minutes  past midnight  and it was indeed this which had taken place  at noon the  froments already learnt that lepailleur was creating a terrible scandal  about the flight of therese  he had immediately gone to the gendarmes  to shout the story to them  and demand that they should bring the guilty  hussy back  chained to her accomplice  and both of them with gyves about  their wrists     he on his side had found a letter in his daughter s bedroom  a plucky  letter in which she plainly said that as she had been struck again the  previous day  she had had enough of it  and was going off of her own  free will  indeed  she added that she was taking gregoire with her  and  was quite big and old enough  now that she was two and twenty  to know  what she was about  lepailleur s fury was largely due to this letter  which he did not dare to show abroad  besides which  his wife  ever  at war with him respecting their son antonin  not only roundly abused  therese  but sneeringly declared that it might all have been expected   and that he  the father  was the cause of the gad about s misconduct   after that  they engaged in fisticuffs  and for a whole week the  district did nothing but talk about the flight of one of the chantebled  lads with the girl of the mill  to the despair of mathieu and marianne   the latter of whom in particular grieved over the sorry business     five days later  a sunday  matters became even worse  as the search for  the runaways remained fruitless lepailleur  boiling over with rancor   went up to the farm  and from the middle of the road  for he did not  venture inside  poured forth a flood of ignoble insults  it so happened  that mathieu was absent  and marianne had great trouble to restrain  gervais as well as frederic  both of whom wished to thrust the miller s  scurrilous language back into his throat  when mathieu came home in the  evening he was extremely vexed to hear of what had happened      it is impossible for this state of things to continue   he said to his  wife  as they were retiring to rest   it looks as if we were hiding   as if we were guilty in the matter  i will go to see that man in the  morning  there is only one thing  and a very simple one  to be done   those unhappy children must be married  for our part we consent  is it  not so  and it is to that man s advantage to consent also  to morrow the  matter must be settled      on the following day  monday  at two o clock in the afternoon  mathieu  set out for the mill  but certain complications  a tragic drama  which  he could not possibly foresee  awaited him there  for years now a  stubborn struggle had been going on between lepailleur and his wife with  respect to antonin  while the farmer had grown more and more exasperated  with his son s idleness and life of low debauchery in paris  the latter  had supported her boy with all the obstinacy of an illiterate woman   who was possessed of a blind faith in his fine handwriting  and felt  convinced that if he did not succeed in life it was simply because he  was refused the money necessary for that purpose  in spite of her sordid  avarice in some matters  the old woman continued bleeding herself for  her son  and even robbed the house  promptly thrusting out her claws and  setting her teeth ready to bite whenever she was caught in the act  and  had to defend some twenty franc piece or other  which she had been on  the point of sending away  and each time the battle began afresh  to  such a point indeed that it seemed as if the shaky old mill would some  day end by falling on their heads     then  all at once  antonin  a perfect wreck at thirty six years of age   fell seriously ill  lepailleur forthwith declared that if the scamp had  the audacity to come home he would pitch him over the wheel into the  water  antonin  however  had no desire to return home  he held the  country in horror and feared  too  that his father might chain him up  like a dog  so his mother placed him with some people of batignolles   paying for his board and for the attendance of a doctor of the district   this had been going on for three months or so  and every fortnight la  lepailleur went to see her son  she had done so the previous thursday   and on the sunday evening she received a telegram summoning her to  batignolles again  thus  on the morning of the day when mathieu repaired  to the mill  she had once more gone to paris after a frightful quarrel  with her husband  who asked if their good for nothing son ever meant to  cease fooling them and spending their money  when he had not the courage  even to turn a spit of earth     alone in the mill that morning lepailleur did not cease storming  at the  slightest provocation he would have hammered his plough to pieces  or  have rushed  axe in hand  and mad with hatred  on the old wheel by way  of avenging his misfortunes  when he saw mathieu come in he believed in  some act of bravado  and almost choked      come  neighbor   said the master of chantebled cordially   let us both  try to be reasonable  i ve come to return your visit  since you called  upon me yesterday  only  bad words never did good work  and the best  course  since this misfortune has happened  is to repair it as speedily  as possible  when would you have us marry off those bad children      thunderstruck by the quiet good nature of this frontal attack   lepailleur did not immediately reply  he had shouted over the house  roofs that he would have no marriage at all  but rather a good lawsuit  by way of sending all the froments to prison  nevertheless  when it  came to reflection  a son of the big farmer of chantebled was not to be  disdained as a son in law      marry them  marry them   he stammered at the first moment   yes  by  fastening a big stone to both their necks and throwing them together  into the river  ah  the wretches  i ll skin them  i will  her as well as  him      at last  however  the miller grew calmer and was even showing a  disposition to discuss matters  when all at once an urchin of janville  came running across the yard      what do you want  eh   called the master of the premises      please  monsieur lepailleur  it s a telegram       all right  give it here      the lad  well pleased with the copper he received as a gratuity  had  already gone off  and still the miller  instead of opening the telegram   stood examining the address on it with the distrustful air of a man who  does not often receive such communications  however  he at last had to  tear it open  it contained but three words   your son dead   and in that  brutal brevity  that prompt  hasty bludgeon blow  one could detect the  mother s cold rage and eager craving to crush without delay the man  the  father yonder  whom she accused of having caused her son s death  even  as she had accused him of being responsible for her daughter s flight   he felt this full well  and staggered beneath the shock  stunned by the  words that appeared on that strip of blue paper  reading them again  and again till he ended by understanding them  then his hands began to  tremble and he burst into oaths      thunder and blazes  what again is this  here s the boy dying now   everything s going to the devil      but his heart dilated and tears appeared in his eyes  unable to remain  standing  he sank upon a chair and again obstinately read the telegram    your son dead  your son dead   as if seeking something else  the  particulars  indeed  which the message did not contain  perhaps the boy  had died before his mother s arrival  or perhaps she had arrived just  before he died  such were his stammered comments  and he repeated a  score of times that she had taken the train at ten minutes past eleven  and must have reached batignolles about half past twelve  as she had  handed in the telegram at twenty minutes past one it seemed more likely  that she had found the lad already dead      curse it  curse it   he shouted   a cursed telegram  it tells you  nothing  and it murders you  she might  at all events  have sent  somebody  i shall have to go there  ah the whole thing s complete  it s  more than a man can bear      lepailleur shouted those words in such accents of rageful despair that  mathieu  full of compassion  made bold to intervene  the sudden shock  of the tragedy had staggered him  and he had hitherto waited in silence   but now he offered his services and spoke of accompanying the other  to paris  he had to retreat  however  for the miller rose to his feet   seized with wild exasperation at perceiving him still there in his  house      ah  yes  you came  and what was it you were saying to me  that we ought  to marry off those wretched children  well  you can see that i m in  proper trim for a wedding  my boy s dead  you ve chosen your day well   be off with you  be off with you  i say  if you don t want me to do  something dreadful      he raised his fists  quite maddened as he was by the presence of mathieu  at that moment when his whole life was wrecked  it was terrible indeed  that this bourgeois who had made a fortune by turning himself into a  peasant should be there at the moment when he so suddenly learnt the  death of antonin  that son whom he had dreamt of turning into a monsieur  by filling his mind with disgust of the soil and sending him to rot of  idleness and vice in paris  it enraged him to find that he had erred   that the earth whom he had slandered  whom he had taxed with decrepitude  and barrenness was really a living  youthful  and fruitful spouse to the  man who knew how to love her  and nought but ruin remained around him   thanks to his imbecile resolve to limit his family  a foul life had  killed his only son  and his only daughter had gone off with a scion of  the triumphant farm  while he was now utterly alone  weeping and howling  in his deserted mill  that mill which he had likewise disdained and  which was crumbling around him with old age      you hear me   he shouted   therese may drag herself at my feet  but  i will never  never give her to your thief of a son  you d like it   wouldn t you  so that folks might mock me all over the district  and so  that you might eat me up as you have eaten up all the others      this finish to it all had doubtless appeared to him  confusedly  in a  sudden threatening vision  antonin being dead  it was gregoire who would  possess the mill  if he should marry therese  and he would possess the  moorland also  that enclosure  hitherto left barren with such savage  delight  and so passionately coveted by the farm  and doubtless he would  cede it to the farm as soon as he should be the master  the thought that  chantebled might yet be increased by the fields which he  lepailleur   had withheld from it brought the miller s delirious rage to a climax      your son  i ll send him to the galleys  and you  if you don t go  i ll  throw you out  be off with you  be off      mathieu  who was very pale  slowly retired before this furious madman   but as he went off he calmly said   you are an unhappy man  i forgive  you  for you are in great grief  besides  i am quite easy  sensible  things always end by taking place      again  a month went by  then  one rainy morning in october  madame  lepailleur was found hanging in the mill stable  there were folks at  janville who related that lepailleur had hung her there  the truth was  that she had given signs of melancholia ever since the death of antonin   moreover  the life led at the mill was no longer bearable  day by day  the husband and wife reproached one another for their son s death and  their daughter s flight  battling ragefully together like two abandoned  beasts shut up in the same cage  folks were merely astonished that such  a harsh  avaricious woman should have been willing to quit this life  without taking her goods and chattels with her     as soon as therese heard of her mother s death she hastened home   repentant  and took her place beside her father again  unwilling as she  was that he should remain alone in his two fold bereavement  at first it  proved a terrible time for her in the company of that brutal old man who  was exasperated by what he termed his bad luck  but she was a girl of  sterling courage and prompt decision  and thus  after a few weeks  she  had made her father consent to her marriage with gregoire  which  as  mathieu had said  was the only sensible course  the news gave great  relief at the farm whither the prodigal son had not yet dared to return   it was believed that the young couple  after eloping together  had lived  in some out of the way district of paris  and it was even suspected that  ambroise  who was liberally minded  had  in a brotherly way  helped them  with his purse  and if  on the one hand  lepailleur consented to the  marriage in a churlish  distrustful manner  like one who deemed himself  robbed  and was simply influenced by the egotistical dread of some  day finding himself quite alone again in his gloomy house  mathieu and  marianne  on the other side  were delighted with an arrangement which  put an end to an equivocal situation that had caused them the greatest  suffering  grieved as they were by the rebellion of one of their  children     curiously enough  it came to pass that gregoire  once married and  installed at the mill in accordance with his wife s desire  agreed with  his father in law far better than had been anticipated  this resulted in  particular from a certain discussion during which lepailleur had wished  to make gregoire swear  that  after his death  he would never dispose  of the moorland enclosure  hitherto kept uncultivated with peasant  stubbornness  to any of his brothers or sisters of the farm  gregoire  took no oath on the subject  but gayly declared that he was not such  a fool as to despoil his wife of the best part of her inheritance   particularly as he proposed to cultivate those moors and  within two or  three years  time  make them the most fertile land in the district  that  which belonged to him did not belong to others  and people would soon  see that he was well able to defend the property which had fallen to  his lot  things took a similar course with respect to the mill  where  gregoire at first contented himself with repairing the old mechanism   for he was unwilling to upset the miller s habits all at once  and  therefore postponed until some future time the installation of an  engine  and the laying down of a line of rails to janville station  all  those ideas formerly propounded by mathieu which henceforth fermented in  his audacious young mind     in this wise  then  people found themselves in presence of a new  gregoire  the madcap had become wise  only retaining of his youthful  follies the audacity which is needful for successful enterprise  and it  must be said that he was admirably seconded by the fair and energetic  therese  they were both enraptured at now being free to love each other  in the romantic old mill  garlanded with ivy  pending the time when  they would resolutely fling it to the ground to install in its place  the great white meal stores and huge new mill stones  which  with their  conquering ambition  they often dreamt of     during the years that followed  mathieu and marianne witnessed other  departures  the three daughters  louise  madeleine  and marguerite  in  turn took their flight from the family nest  all three found husbands  in the district  louise  a plump brunette  all gayety and health   with abundant hair and large laughing eyes  married notary mazaud of  janville  a quiet  pensive little man  whose occasional silent smiles  alone denoted the perfect satisfaction which he felt at having found a  wife of such joyous disposition  then madeleine  whose chestnut tresses  were tinged with gleaming gold  and who was slimmer than her sister  and  of a more dreamy style of beauty  her character and disposition refined  by her musical tastes  made a love match which was quite a romance   herbette  the architect  who became her husband  was a handsome  elegant  man  already celebrated  he owned near monvel a park like estate  where  he came to rest at times from the fatigue of his labors in paris     at last  marguerite  the least pretty of the girls  indeed  she  was quite plain  but derived a charm from her infinite goodness of  heart  was chosen in marriage by dr  chambouvet  a big  genial  kindly  fellow  who had inherited his father s practice at vieux bourg  where he  lived in a large white house  which had become the resort of the poor   and thus the three girls being married  the only ones who remained with  mathieu and marianne in the slowly emptying nest were their two last  boys  nicolas and benjamin     at the same time  however  as the youngsters flew away and installed  themselves elsewhere  there came other little ones  a constant swarming  due to the many family marriages  in eight years  denis  who reigned  at the factory in paris  had been presented by his wife with three  children  two boys  lucien and paul  and a girl  hortense  then leonce   the son of ambroise  who was conquering such a high position in the  commercial world  now had a brother  charles  and two little sisters   pauline and sophie  at the farm  moreover  gervais was already the  father of two boys  leon and henri  while claire  his sister  could  count three children  a boy  joseph  and two daughters  lucile and  angele  there was also gregoire  at the mill  with a big boy who had  received the name of robert  and there were also the three last married  daughters  louise  with a girl two years old  madeleine  with a boy six  months of age  and marguerite  who in anticipation of a happy event  had  decided to call her child stanislas  if it were a boy  and christine  if  it should be a girl     thus upon every side the family oak spread out its branches  its trunk  forking and multiplying  and boughs sprouting from boughs at each  successive season  and withal mathieu was not yet sixty  and marianne  not yet fifty seven  both still possessed flourishing health  and  strength  and gayety  and were ever in delight at seeing the family   which had sprung from them  thus growing and spreading  invading all the  country around  even like a forest born from a single tree     but the great and glorious festival of chantebled at that period was the  birth of mathieu and marianne s first great grandchild  a girl  called  angeline  daughter of their granddaughter  berthe  in this little girl   all pink and white  the ever regretted blaise seemed to live again   so closely did she resemble him that charlotte  his widow  already a  grandmother in her forty second year  wept with emotion at the sight of  her  madame desvignes had died six months previously  passing away  even  as she had lived  gently and discreetly  at the termination of her task   which had chiefly consisted in rearing her two daughters on the scanty  means at her disposal  still it was she  who  before quitting the scene   had found a husband for her granddaughter  berthe  in the person of  philippe havard  a young engineer who had recently been appointed  assistant manager at a state factory near mareuil  it was at chantebled   however  that berthe s little angeline was born  and on the day of  the churching  the whole family assembled together there once more to  glorify the great grandfather and great grandmother      ah  well   said marianne gayly  as she stood beside the babe s cradle    if the young ones fly away there are others born  and so the nest will  never be empty       never  never   repeated mathieu with emotion  proud as he felt of  that continual victory over solitude and death   we shall never be left  alone      yet there came another departure which brought them many tears  nicolas   the youngest but one of their boys  who was approaching his twentieth  birthday  and thus nigh the cross roads of life  had not yet decided  which one he would follow  he was a dark  sturdy young man  with an  open  laughing face  as a child  he had adored tales of travel and  far away adventure  and had always evinced great courage and endurance   returning home enraptured from interminable rambles  and never uttering  complaints  however badly his feet might be blistered  and withal he  possessed a most orderly mind  ever carefully arranging and classifying  his little belongings in his drawers  and looking down with contempt on  the haphazard way in which his sisters kept their things     later on  as he grew up  he became thoughtful  as if he were vainly  seeking around him some means of realizing his two fold craving  that  of discovering some new land and organizing it properly  one of the  last born of a numerous family  he no longer found space enough for the  amplitude and force of his desires  his brothers and sisters had already  taken all the surrounding lands  and he stifled  threatened also  as it  were  with famine  and ever sought the broad expanse that he dreamt of   where he might grow and reap his bread  no more room  no more food  at  first he knew not in which direction to turn  but groped and hesitated  for some months  nevertheless  his hearty laughter continued to gladden  the house  he wearied neither his father nor his mother with the care  of his destiny  for he knew that he was already strong enough to fix it  himself     there was no corner left for him at the farm where gervais and claire  took up all the room  at the beauchene works denis was all sufficient   reigning there like a conscientious toiler  and nothing justified  a younger brother in claiming a share beside him  at the mill  too   gregoire was as yet barely established  and his kingdom was so small  that he could not possibly cede half of it  thus an opening was only  possible with ambroise  and nicolas ended by accepting an obliging offer  which the latter made to take him on trial for a few months  by way of  initiating him into the higher branches of commerce  ambroise s fortune  was becoming prodigious since old uncle du hordel had died  leaving him  his commission business  year by year the new master increased his trade  with all the countries of the world  thanks to his lucky audacity and  broad international views  he was enriching himself with the spoils of  the earth  and though nicolas again began to stifle in ambroise s huge  store houses  where the riches of distant countries  the most varied  climes  were collected together  it was there that his real vocation  came to him  for a voice suddenly arose  calling him away yonder to dim   unknown regions  vast stretches of country yet sterile  which needed to  be populated  and cleared and sowed with the crops of the future     for two months nicolas kept silent respecting the designs which he was  now maturing  he was extremely discreet  as are all men of great energy   who reflect before they act  he must go  that was certain  since neither  space nor sufficiency of sunlight remained for him in the cradle of his  birth  but if he went off alone  would that not be going in an imperfect  state  deficient in the means needed for the heroic task of populating  and clearing a new land  he knew a girl of janville  one lisbeth moreau   who was tall and strong  and whose robust health  seriousness  and  activity had charmed him  she was nineteen years of age  and  like  nicolas  she stifled in the little nook to which destiny had confined  her  for she craved for the free and open air  yonder  afar off  an  orphan  and long dependent on an aunt  who was simply a little village  haberdasher  she had hitherto  from feelings of affection  remained  cloistered in a small and gloomy shop  but her aunt had lately died   leaving her some ten thousand francs  and her dream was to sell the  little business  and go away and really live at last  one october  evening  when nicolas and lisbeth told one another things that they  had never previously told anybody  they came to an understanding  they  resolutely took each other s hand and plighted their troth for life  for  the hard battle of creating a new world  a new family  somewhere on the  earth s broad surface  in those mysterious  far away climes of which  they knew so little   twas a delightful betrothal  full of courage and  faith     only then  everything having been settled  did nicolas speak out   announcing his departure to his father and mother  it was an autumn  evening  still mild  but fraught with winter s first shiver  and the  twilight was falling  intense grief wrung the parents  hearts as soon  as they understood their son  this time it was not simply a young one  flying from the family nest to build his own on some neighboring tree  of the common forest  it was flight across the seas forever  severance  without hope of return  they would see their other children again  but  this one was breathing an eternal farewell  their consent would be the  share of cruel sacrifice  that life demands  their supreme gift to life   the tithe levied by life on their affection and their blood  to pursue  its victory  life  the perpetual conqueror  demanded this portion  of their flesh  this overplus of the numerous family  which was  overflowing  spreading  peopling the world  and what could they answer   how could they refuse  the son who was unprovided for took himself  off  nothing could be more logical or more sensible  far beyond the  fatherland there were vast continents yet uninhabited  and the seed  which is scattered by the breezes of heaven knows no frontiers  beyond  the race there is mankind with that endless spreading of humanity that  is leading us to the one fraternal people of the accomplished times   when the whole earth shall be but one sole city of truth and justice     moreover  quite apart from the great dream of those seers  the poets   nicolas  like a practical man  whatever his enthusiasm  gayly gave his  reasons for departing  he did not wish to be a parasite  he was setting  off to the conquest of another land  where he would grow the bread he  needed  since his own country had no field left for him  besides  he  took his country with him in his blood  she it was that he wished to  enlarge afar off with unlimited increase of wealth and strength  it was  ancient africa  the mysterious  now explored  traversed from end to  end  that attracted him  in the first instance he intended to repair to  senegal  whence he would doubtless push on to the soudan  to the very  heart of the virgin lands where he dreamt of a new france  an immense  colonial empire  which would rejuvenate the old gallic race by endowing  it with its due share of the earth  and it was there that he had the  ambition of carving out a kingdom for himself  and of founding with  lisbeth another dynasty of froments  and a new chantebled  covering  under the hot sun a tract ten times as extensive as the old one  and  peopled with the people of his own children  and he spoke of all this  with such joyous courage that mathieu and marianne ended by smiling amid  their tears  despite the rending of their poor hearts      go  my lad  we cannot keep you back  go wherever life calls you   wherever you may live with more health and joy and strength  all that  may spring from you yonder will still be health and joy and strength  derived from us  of which we shall be proud  you are right  one must not  weep  your departure must be a fete  for the family does not separate   it simply extends  invades  and conquers the world      nevertheless  on the day of farewell  after the marriage of nicolas and  lisbeth there was an hour of painful emotion at chantebled  the family  had met to share a last meal all together  and when the time came for  the young and adventurous couple to tear themselves from the maternal  soil there were those who sobbed although they had vowed to be very  brave  nicolas and lisbeth were going off with little means  but rich in  hopes  apart from the ten thousand francs of the wife s dowry they had  only been willing to take another ten thousand  just enough to provide  for the first difficulties  might courage and labor therefore prove  sturdy artisans of conquest     young benjamin  the last born of the brothers froment  was particularly  upset by this departure  he was a delicate  good looking child not yet  twelve years old  whom his parents greatly spoiled  thinking that he was  weak  and they were quite determined that they would at all events keep  him with them  so handsome did they find him with his soft limpid eyes  and beautiful curly hair  he was growing up in a languid way  dreamy   petted  idle among his mother s skirts  like the one charming weakling  of that strong  hardworking family      let me kiss you again  my good nicolas   said he to his departing  brother   when will you come back       never  my little benjamin      the boy shuddered      never  never   he repeated   oh  that s too long  come back  come back  some day  so that i may kiss you again       never   repeated nicolas  turning pale himself   never  never      he had lifted up the lad  whose tears were raining fast  and then for  all came the supreme grief  the frightful moment of the hatchet stroke   of the separation which was to be eternal      good by  little brother  good by  good by  all of you      while mathieu accompanied the future conqueror to the door for the last  time wishing him victory  benjamin in wild grief sought a refuge beside  his mother who was blinded by her tears  and she caught him up with a  passionate clasp  as if seized with fear that he also might leave her   he was the only one now left to them in the family nest           xxi    at the factory  in her luxurious house on the quay  where she had long  reigned as sovereign mistress  constance for twelve years already  had been waiting for destiny  remaining rigid and stubborn amid the  continual crumbling of her life and hopes     during those twelve years beauchene had pursued a downward course  the  descent of which was fatal  he was right at the bottom now  in the  last state of degradation  after beginning simply as a roving husband   festively inclined  he had ended by living entirely away from his home   principally in the company of two women  aunt and niece  he was now but  a pitiful human rag  fast approaching some shameful death  and large as  his fortune had been  it had not sufficed him  as he grew older he  had squandered money yet more and more lavishly  immense sums being  swallowed up in disreputable adventures  the scandal of which it had  been necessary to stifle  thus he at last found himself poor  receiving  but a small portion of the ever increasing profits of the works  which  were in full prosperity     this was the disaster which brought so much suffering to constance in  her incurable pride  beauchene  since the death of his son  had quite  abandoned himself to a dissolute life  thinking of nothing but his  pleasures  and taking no further interest in his establishment  what was  the use of defending it  since there was no longer an heir to whom it  might be transmitted  enlarged and enriched  and thus he had surrendered  it  bit by bit  to denis  his partner  whom  by degrees  he allowed to  become the sole master  on arriving at the works  denis had possessed  but one of the six shares which represented the totality of the property  according to the agreement  and beauchene had even reserved to himself  the right of repurchasing that share within a certain period  but far  from being in a position to do so before the appointed date was passed   he had been obliged to cede yet another share to the young man  in order  to free himself of debts which he could not confess     from that time forward it became a habit with beauchene to cede denis a  fresh share every two years  a third followed the second  then came the  turn of the fourth and the fifth  in such wise  indeed  that after a  final arrangement  he had not even kept a whole share for himself  but  simply some portion of the sixth  and even that was really fictitious   for denis had only acknowledged it in order to have a pretext for  providing him with a certain income  which  by the way  he subdivided   handing half of it to constance every month     she  therefore  was ignorant of nothing  she knew that  as a matter of  fact  the works would belong to that son of the hated froments  whenever  he might choose to close the doors on their old master  who  as it  happened  was never seen now in the workshops  true  there was a clause  in the covenant which admitted  so long as that covenant should not be  broken  the possibility of repurchasing all the shares at one and the  same time  was it  then  some mad hope of doing this  a fervent belief  in a miracle  in the possibility of some saviour descending from heaven   that kept constance thus rigid and stubborn  awaiting destiny  those  twelve years of vain waiting  and increasing decline did not seem to  have diminished her conviction that in spite of everything she would  some day triumph  no doubt her tears had gushed forth at chantebled in  presence of the victory of mathieu and marianne  but she soon recovered  her self possession  and lived on in the hope that some unexpected  occurrence would at last prove that she  the childless woman  was in the  right     she could not have said precisely what it was she wished  she was  simply bent on remaining alive until misfortune should fall upon the  over numerous family  to exculpate her for what had happened in her own  home  the loss of her son who was in the grave  and the downfall of her  husband who was in the gutter  all the abomination  indeed  which had  been so largely wrought by herself  but which filled her with agony   however much her heart might bleed over her losses  her vanity as an  honest bourgeoise filled her with rebellious thoughts  for she could not  admit that she had been in the wrong  and thus she awaited the revenge  of destiny in that luxurious house  which was far too large now that  she alone inhabited it  she only occupied the rooms on the first floor   where she shut herself up for days together with an old serving woman   the sole domestic that she had retained  gowned in black  as if bent on  wearing eternal mourning for maurice  always erect  stiff  and haughtily  silent  she never complained  although her covert exasperation had  greatly affected her heart  in such wise that she experienced at times  most terrible attacks of stifling  these she kept as secret as possible   and one day when the old servant ventured to go for doctor boutan she  threatened her with dismissal  she would not even answer the doctor   and she refused to take any remedies  certain as she felt that she would  last as long as the hope which buoyed her up     yet what anguish it was when she suddenly began to stifle  all alone  in the empty house  without son or husband near her  she called nobody  since she knew that nobody would come  and the attack over  with what  unconquerable obstinacy did she rise erect again  repeating that her  presence sufficed to prevent denis from being the master  from reigning  alone in full sovereignty  and that in any case he would not have the  house and install himself in it like a conqueror  so long as she had not  sunk to death under the final collapse of the ceilings     amid this retired life  constance  haunted as she was by her fixed  idea  had no other occupation than that of watching the factory  and  ascertaining what went on there day by day  morange  whom she had made  her confidant  gave her information in all simplicity almost every  evening  when he came to speak to her for a moment after leaving his  office  she learnt everything from his lips  the successive sales of  the shares into which the property had been divided  their gradual  acquisition by denis  and the fact that beauchene and herself were  henceforth living on the new master s liberality  moreover  she so  organized her system of espionage as to make the old accountant tell her  unwittingly all that he knew of the private life led by denis  his wife  marthe  and their children  lucien  paul  and hortense all  indeed  that  was done and said in the modest little pavilion where the young people   in spite of their increasing fortune  were still residing  evincing no  ambitious haste to occupy the large house on the quay  they did not  even seem to notice what scanty accommodation they had in that pavilion   while she alone dwelt in the gloomy mansion  which was so spacious  that she seemed quite lost in it  and she was enraged  too  by their  deference  by the tranquil way in which they waited for her to be no  more  for she had been unable to make them quarrel with her  and was  obliged to show herself grateful for the means they gave her  and to  kiss their children  whom she hated  when they brought her flowers     thus  months and years went by  and almost every evening when morange  for a moment called on constance  he found her in the same little silent  salon  gowned in the same black dress  and stiffened into a posture of  obstinate expectancy  though no sign was given of destiny s revenge  of  the patiently hoped for fall of misfortune upon others  she never seemed  to doubt of her ultimate victory  on the contrary  when things fell  more and more heavily upon her  she drew herself yet more erect  defying  fate  buoyed up by the conviction that it would at last be forced to  prove that she was right  thus  she remained immutable  superior to  fatigue  and ever relying on a prodigy     each evening  when morange called during those twelve years  the  conversation invariably began in the same way      nothing fresh since yesterday  dear madame       no  my friend  nothing       well  the chief thing is to enjoy good health  one can wait for better  days       oh  nobody enjoys good health  still one waits all the same      and now one evening  at the end of the twelve years  as morange went in  to see her  he detected that the atmosphere of the little drawing room  was changed  quivering as it were with restrained delight amid the  eternal silence      nothing fresh since yesterday  dear madame       yes  my friend  there s something fresh       something favorable i hope  then  something pleasant that you have been  waiting for       something that i have been waiting for  yes  what one knows how to wait  for always comes      he looked at her in surprise  feeling almost anxious when he saw  how altered she was  with glittering eyes and quick gestures  what  fulfilment of her desires  after so many years of immutable mourning   could have resuscitated her like that  she smiled  she breathed  vigorously  as if she were relieved of the enormous weight which had so  long crushed and immured her  but when he asked the cause of her great  happiness she said      i will not tell you yet  my friend  perhaps i do wrong to rejoice  for  everything is still very vague and doubtful  only somebody told me this  morning certain things  which i must make sure of  and think over  when  i have done so i shall confide in you  you may rely on it  for i tell  you everything  besides which  i shall no doubt need your help  so have  a little patience  some evening you shall come to dinner with me here   and we shall have the whole evening before us to chat at our ease  but  ah   mon dieu   if it were only true  if it were only the miracle at  last      more than three weeks elapsed before morange heard anything further  he  saw that constance was very thoughtful and very feverish  but he did not  even question her  absorbed as he himself was in the solitary  not  to say automatic  life which he had made for himself  he had lately  completed his sixty ninth year  thirty years had gone by since the  death of his wife valerie  more than twenty since his daughter reine  had joined her  and he still ever lived on in his methodical  punctual  manner  amid the downfall of his existence  never had man suffered more  than he  passed through greater tragedies  experienced keener remorse   and withal he came and went in a careful  correct way  ever and ever  prolonging his career of mediocrity  like one whom many may have  forgotten  but whom keenness of grief has preserved     nevertheless morange had evidently sustained some internal damage of a  nature to cause anxiety  he was lapsing into the most singular manias   while obstinately retaining possession of the over large flat which he  had formerly occupied with his wife and daughter  he now lived there  absolutely alone  for he had dismissed his servant  and did his own  marketing  cooking  and cleaning  for ten years nobody but himself had  been inside his rooms  and the most filthy neglect was suspected there   but in vain did the landlord speak of repairs  he was not allowed even  to cross the threshold  moreover  although the old accountant  who was  now white as snow  with a long  streaming beard  remained scrupulously  clean of person  he wore a most wretched threadbare coat  which he  must have spent his evenings in repairing  such  too  was his maniacal   sordid avarice that he no longer spent a farthing on himself apart from  the money which he paid for his bread  bread of the commonest kind   which he purchased every four days and ate when it was stale  in order  that he might make it last the longer  this greatly puzzled the people  who were acquainted with him  and never a week went by without the  house porter propounding the question   when a gentleman of such quiet  habits earns eight thousand francs a year at his office and never spends  a cent  what can he do with his money   some folks even tried to reckon  up the amount which morange must be piling in some corner  and thought  that it might perhaps run to some hundreds of thousands of francs     but more serious trouble declared itself  he was twice snatched away  from certain death  one day  when denis was returning homewards across  the grenelle bridge he perceived morange leaning far over the parapet   watching the flow of the water  and all ready to make a plunge if he  had not been grasped by his coat tails  the poor man  on recovering his  self possession  began to laugh in his gentle way  and talked of having  felt giddy  then  on another occasion  at the works  victor moineaud  pushed him away from some machinery in motion at the very moment when   as if hypnotized  he was about to surrender himself to its devouring  clutches  then he again smiled  and acknowledged that he had done wrong  in passing so near to the wheels  after this he was watched  for people  came to the conclusion that he occasionally lost his head  if denis  retained him as chief accountant  this was  firstly  from a feeling  of gratitude for his long services  but  apart from that matter  the  extraordinary thing was that morange had never discharged his duties  more ably  obstinately tracing every doubtful centime in his books   and displaying the greatest accuracy over the longest additions  always  showing a calm and restful face  as though no tempest had ever assailed  his heart  he clung tightly to his mechanical life  like a discreet  maniac  who  though people might not know it  ought  perhaps  to have  been placed under restraint     at the same time  it should be mentioned that for some few years already  there had been quite a big affair in morange s life  although he was  constance s confidant  although she had made him her creature by the  force of her despotic will  he had gradually conceived the greatest  affection for denis s daughter  hortense  as this child grew up  he  fancied that he found in her his own long mourned daughter  reine  she  had recently completed her ninth year  and each time that morange  met her he was thrown into a state of emotion and adoration  the more  touching since it was all a divine illusion on his part  for the two  girls in no wise resembled each other  the one having been extremely  dark  and the other being nearly fair  in spite of his terrible avarice   the accountant loaded hortense with dolls and sweetmeats on every  possible occasion  and at last his affection for the child absorbed him  to such a degree that constance felt offended by it  she thereupon gave  him to understand that whosoever was not entirely on her side was  in  reality  against her     to all appearance  he made his submission  in reality  he only loved the  child the more for the thwarting of his passion  and he watched for her  in order to kiss her in secret  in his daily intercourse with constance   in showing apparent fidelity to the former mistress of the works  he  now simply yielded to fear  like the poor weak being he was  one whom  constance had ever bent beneath her stern hand  the pact between them  was an old one  it dated from that monstrous thing which they alone  knew  that complicity of which they never spoke  but which bound them so  closely together     he  with his weak  good nature  seemed from that day to have remained  annihilated  tamed  cowed like a frightened animal  since that day  too   he had learnt many other things  and now no secret of the house remained  unknown to him  this was not surprising  he had been living there so  many years  he had so often walked to and fro with his short  discreet   maniacal step  hearing  seeing  and surprising everything  however  this  madman  who knew the truth and who remained silent  this madman  left  free amid the mysterious drama enacted in the beauchenes  home  was  gradually coming to a rebellious mood  particularly since he was  compelled to hide himself to kiss his little friend hortense  his heart  growled at the thought of it  and he felt ready to explode should his  passion be interfered with     all at once  one evening  constance kept him to dinner  and he suspected  that the hour of her revelations had come  on seeing how she quivered  and how erectly she carried her little figure  like a fighter henceforth  certain of victory  nevertheless  although the servant left them alone  after bringing in at one journey the whole of the frugal repast  she did  not broach the great affair at table  she spoke of the factory and then  of denis and his wife marthe  whom she criticised  and she was even  so foolish as to declare that hortense was badly behaved  ugly  and  destitute of grace  the accountant  like the coward he was  listened to  her  never daring to protest in spite of the irritation and rebellion of  his whole being      well  we shall see   she said at last   when one and all are put back  into their proper places      then she waited until they returned to the little drawing room  and the  doors were shut behind them  and it was only then  near the fire   amid the deep silence of the winter evening  that she spoke out on the  subject which she had at heart      as i think i have already told you  my friend  i have need of you   you must obtain employment at the works for a young man in whom i am  interested  and if you desire to please me  you will even take him into  your own office      morange  who was seated in front of her on the other side of the  chimney piece  gave her a look of surprise      but i am not the master   he replied   apply to the master  he will  certainly do whatever you ask       no  i do not wish to be indebted to denis in any way  besides  that  would not suit my plans  you yourself must recommend the young man  and  take him as an assistant  coaching him and giving him a post under you   come  you surely have the power to choose a clerk  besides  i insist on  it      she spoke like a sovereign  and he bowed his back  for he had obeyed  people all his life  first his wife  then his daughter  and now that  dethroned old queen who terrified him in spite of the dim feeling of  rebellion which had been growing within him for some time past      no doubt  i might take the young man on   he said   but who is he      constance did not immediately reply  she had turned towards the fire   apparently for the purpose of raising a log of wood with the tongs  but  in reality to give herself time for further reflection  what good would  it do to tell him everything at once  she would some day be forced to  tell it him  if she wished to have him entirely on her side  but there  was no hurry  and she fancied that it would be skilful policy if at  present she merely prepared the ground      he is a young man whose position has touched me  on account of certain  recollections   she replied   perhaps you remember a girl who worked  here  oh  a very long time ago  some thirty years at the least  a  certain norine moineaud  one of old moineaud s daughters      morange had hastily raised his head  and as sudden light flashed on his  memory he looked at constance with dilated eyes  before he could even  weigh his words he let everything escape him in a cry of surprise    alexandre honore  norine s son  the child of rougemont      quite thunderstruck by those words  constance dropped the tongs she was  holding  and gazed into the old man s eyes  diving to the very depths of  his soul      ah  you know  then   she said   what is it you know  you must tell me   hide nothing  speak  i insist on it      what he knew  why  he knew everything  he spoke slowly and at length   as from the depths of a dream  he had witnessed everything  learnt  everything  norine s trouble  the money given by beauchene to provide  for her at madame bourdieu s  the child carried to the foundling  hospital and then put out to nurse at rougemont  whence he had fled  after stealing three hundred francs  and the old accountant was even  aware that the young scamp  after stranding on the pavement of paris   had led the vilest of lives there      but who told you all that  how do you know all that   cried constance   who felt full of anxiety     he waved his arm with a vague  sweeping gesture  as if to take in  all the surrounding atmosphere  the whole house  he knew those things  because they were things pertaining to the place  which people had told  him of  or which he had guessed  he could no longer remember exactly how  they had reached him  but he knew them well      you understand   said he   when one has been in a place for more than  thirty years  things end by coming to one naturally  i know everything   everything      constance started and deep silence fell  he  with his eyes fixed on the  embers  had sunk back into the dolorous past  she reflected that it was   after all  preferable that the position should be perfectly plain  since  he was acquainted with everything  it was only needful that she   with all determination and bravery  should utilize him as her docile  instrument      alexandre honore  the child of rougemont   she said   yes  that is the  young man whom i have at last found again  but are you also aware of the  steps which i took twelve years ago  when i despaired of finding him   and actually thought him dead      morange nodded affirmatively  and she again went on speaking  relating  that she had long since renounced her old plans  when all at once  destiny had revealed itself to her      imagine a flash of lightning   she exclaimed   it was on the morning  of the day when you found me so moved  my sister in law  seraphine  who  does not call on me four times a year  came here  to my great surprise   at ten o clock  she has become very strange  as you are aware  and i did  not at first pay any attention to the story which she began to relate to  me  the story of a young man whom she had become acquainted with through  some lady  an unfortunate young man who had been spoilt by bad company   and whom one might save by a little help  then what a blow it was   my friend  when she all at once spoke out plainly  and told me of  the discovery which she had made by chance  i tell you  it is destiny  awaking and striking      the story was indeed curious  prematurely aged though she was   seraphine  amid her growing insanity  continued to lead a wild  rackety  life  and the strangest stories were related of her  a singular caprice  of hers  given her own viciousness  was to join  as a lady patroness   a society whose purpose was to succor and moralize young offenders on  their release from prison  and it was in this wise that she had become  acquainted with alexandre honore  now a big fellow of two and thirty   who had just completed a term of six years  imprisonment  he had ended  by telling her his true story  speaking of rougemont  naming norine his  mother  and relating the fruitless efforts that he had made in former  years to discover his father  who was some immensely wealthy man  in the  midst of it  seraphine suddenly understood everything  and in particular  why it was that his face had seemed so familiar to her  his striking  resemblance to beauchene sufficed to throw a vivid light upon the  question of his parentage  for fear of worry  she herself told him  nothing  but as she remembered how passionately constance had at one  time striven to find him  she went to her and acquainted her with her  discovery      he knows nothing as yet   constance explained to morange   my  sister in law will simply send him here as if to a lady friend who will  find him a good situation  it appears that he now asks nothing better  than to work  if he has misconducted himself  the unhappy fellow  there  have been many excuses for it  and  besides  i will answer for him as  soon as he is in my hands  he will then only do as i tell him      all that constance knew respecting alexandre s recent years was a story  which he had concocted and retailed to seraphine  a story to the effect  that he owed his long term of imprisonment to a woman  the real culprit   who had been his mistress and whom he had refused to denounce  of course  that imprisonment  whatever its cause  only accounted for six out of  the twelve years which had elapsed since his disappearance  and the six  others  of which he said nothing  might conceal many an act of ignominy  and crime  on the other hand  imprisonment at least seemed to have had a  restful effect on him  he had emerged from his long confinement  calmer  and keener witted  with the intention of spoiling his life no longer   and cleansed  clad  and schooled by seraphine  he had almost become a  presentable young man     morange at last looked up from the glowing embers  at which he had been  staring so fixedly      well  what do you want to do with him   he inquired   does he write a  decent hand       yes  his handwriting is good  no doubt  however  he knows very little   it is for that reason that i wish to intrust him to you  you will polish  him up for me and make him conversant with everything  my desire is that  in a year or two he should know everything about the factory  like a  master      at that last word which enlightened him  the accountant s good sense  suddenly awoke  amid the manias which were wrecking his mind  he had  remained a man of figures with a passion for arithmetical accuracy  and  he protested      well  madame  since you wish me to assist you  pray tell me everything   tell me in what work we can employ this young man here  really now   you surely cannot hope through him to regain possession of the factory   re purchase the shares  and become sole owner of the place      then  with the greatest logic and clearness  he showed how foolish such  a dream would be  enumerating figures and fully setting forth how large  a sum of money would be needed to indemnify denis  who was installed in  the place like a conqueror      besides  dear madame  i don t understand why you should take that young  man rather than another  he has no legal rights  as you must be aware   he could never be anything but a stranger here  and i should prefer an  intelligent  honest man  acquainted with our line of business      constance had set to work poking the fire logs with the tongs  when she  at last looked up she thrust her face towards the other s  and said in  a low voice  but violently   alexandre is my husband s son  he is the  heir  he is not the stranger  the stranger is that denis  that son of  the froments  who has robbed us of our property  you rend my heart  you  make it bleed  my friend  by forcing me to tell you this      the answer she thus gave was the answer of a conservative bourgeoise   who held that it would be more just if the inheritance should go to an  illegitimate scion of the house rather than to a stranger  doubtless  the woman  the wife  the mother within her  bled even as she herself  acknowledged  but she sacrificed everything to her rancor  she would  drive the stranger away even if in doing so her own flesh should be  lacerated  then  too  it vaguely seemed to her that her husband s son  must be in some degree her own  since his father was likewise the father  of the son to whom she had given birth  and who was dead  besides  she  would make that young fellow her son  she would direct him  she would  compel him to be hers  to work through her and for her      you wish to know how i shall employ him in the place   she resumed    i myself don t know  it is evident that i shall not easily find the  hundreds of thousands of francs which may be required  your figures are  accurate  and it is possible that we may never have the money to buy  back the property  but  all the same  why not fight  why not try  and   besides  i will admit it  suppose we are vanquished  well then  so much  the worse for the other  for i assure you that if this young man will  only listen to me  he will then become the agent of destruction  the  avenger and punisher  implanted in the factory to wreck it      with a gesture which summoned ruin athwart the walls  she finished  expressing her abominable hopes  among her vague plans  reared upon  hate  was that of employing the wretched alexandre as a destructive  weapon  whose ravages would bring her some relief  should she lose  all other battles  that would assuredly be the final one  and she had  attained to this pitch of madness through the boundless despair in which  the loss of her only son had plunged her  withered  consumed by a love  which she could not content  then demented  perverted to the point of  crime     morange shuddered when  with her stubborn fierceness  she concluded    for twelve years past i have been waiting for a stroke of destiny  and  here it is  i would rather perish than not draw from it the last chance  of good fortune which it brings me      this meant that denis s ruin was decided on  and would be effected if  destiny were willing  and the old accountant could picture the disaster   innocent children struck down in the person of their father  a great and  most unjust catastrophe  which made his kindly heart rise in rebellion   would he allow that fresh crime to be committed without shouting aloud  all that he knew  doubtless the memory of the other crime  the first  one  the monstrous buried crime about which they both kept silence   returned at that horrible moment and shone out disturbingly in his eyes   for she herself shuddered as if she could see it there  while with the  view of mastering him she gazed at him fixedly  for a moment  as  they peered into one another s eyes  they lived once more beside the  murderous trap  and shivered in the cold gust which rose from the abyss   and this time again morange  like a poor weak man overpowered by a  woman s will  was vanquished  and did not speak      so it is agreed  my friend   she softly resumed   i rely on you to  take alexandre  in the first place  as a clerk  you can see him here one  evening at five o clock  after dusk  for i do not wish him to know  at first what interest i take in him  shall we say the day after  to morrow       yes  the evening of the day after to morrow  if it pleases you  dear  madame      on the morrow morange displayed so much agitation that the wife of the  door porter of the house where he resided  a woman who was ever watching  him  imparted her fears to her husband  the old gentleman was certainly  going to have an attack  for he had forgotten to put on his slippers  when he came downstairs to fetch some water in the morning  and   besides  he went on talking to himself  and looked dreadfully upset  the  most extraordinary incident of the day  however  was that after lunch  morange quite forgot himself  and was an hour late in returning to his  office  a lack of punctuality which had no precedent  which  in the  memory of everybody at the works  had never occurred before     as a matter of fact  morange had been carried away as by a storm  and   walking straight before him  had once more found himself on the grenelle  bridge  where denis had one day saved him from the fascination of the  water  and some force  some impulse had carried him again to the very  same spot  and made him lean over the same parapet  gazing  in the same  way as previously  at the flowing river  ever since the previous evening  he had been repeating the same words  words which he stammered in an  undertone  and which haunted and tortured him   would he allow that  fresh crime to be committed without shouting aloud what he knew   no  doubt it was those words  of which he could not rid himself  that had  made him forget to put on his slippers in the morning  and that had just  now again dazed him to the point of preventing him from returning to the  factory  as if he no longer recognized the entrance as he passed it  and  if he were at present leaning over that water  had he not been impelled  thither by an unconscious desire to have done with all his troubles   an instinctive hope of drowning the torment into which he was thrown  by those stubbornly recurring words  down below  at the bottom of the  river  those words would at last cease  he would no longer repeat them   he would no longer hear them urging him to an act of energy for which he  could not find sufficient strength  and the call of the water was very  gentle  and it would be so pleasant to have to struggle no longer  to  yield to destiny  like a poor soft hearted weakling who has lived too  long     morange leant forward more and more  and in fancy could already feel the  sonorous river seizing him  when a gay young voice in the rear recalled  him to reality      what are you looking at  monsieur morange  are there any big fishes  there      it was hortense  looking extremely pretty  and tall already for her ten  years  whom a maid was conducting on a visit to some little friends at  auteuil  and when the distracted accountant turned round  he remained  for a moment with trembling hands  and eyes moist with tears  at the  sight of that apparition  that dear angel  who had recalled him from so  far      what  is it you  my pet   he exclaimed   no  no  there are no big  fishes  i think that they hide at the bottom because the water is so  cold in winter  are you going on a visit  you look quite beautiful in  that fur trimmed cloak      the little girl began to laugh  well pleased at being flattered and  loved  for her old friend s voice quivered with adoration      yes  yes  i am very happy  there are to be some private theatricals  where i m going  oh  it is amusing to feel happy      she spoke those words like his own reine might formerly have spoken  them  and he could have gone down on his knees to kiss her little hands  like an idol s      but it is necessary that you should always be happy   he replied   you  look so beautiful  i must really kiss you       oh  you may  monsieur morange  i m quite willing  ah  you know the doll  you gave me  her name s margot  and you have no idea how good she is   come to see her some day      he had kissed her  and with glowing heart  ready for martyrdom  he  watched her as she went off in the pale light of winter  what he had  thought of would be too cowardly  besides  that child must be happy     he slowly quitted the bridge  while within him the haunting words rang  out with decisive distinctness  demanding a reply   would he allow that  fresh crime to be committed without shouting aloud what he knew   no   no  it was impossible  he would speak  he would act  nevertheless  his  mind remained clouded  befogged  how could he speak  how could he act     then  to crown his extravagant conduct  utterly breaking away from the  habits of forty years  he no sooner returned to the office than  instead  of immediately plunging into his everlasting additions  he began to  write a long letter  this letter  which was addressed to mathieu   recounted the whole affair  alexandre s resurrection  constance s plans   and the service which he himself had promised to render her  these  things were set down simply as his impulse dictated  like a kind of  confession by which he relieved his feelings  he had not yet come to  any positive decision as to how he should play the part of a justiciar   which seemed so heavy to his shoulders  his one purpose was to warn  mathieu in order that there might be two of them to decide and act   and he simply finished by asking the other to come to see him on the  following evening  though not before six o clock  as he desired to see  alexandre and learn how the interview passed off  and what constance  might require of the young man     the ensuing night  the ensuing day  must have been full of abominable  torment for morange  the doorkeeper s wife recounted  later on  that the  fourth floor tenant had heard the old gentleman walking about overhead  all through the night  doors were slammed  and furniture was dragged  about as if for a removal  it was even thought that one could detect  cries  sobs  and the monologues of a madman addressing phantoms  some  mysterious rendering of worship to the dead who haunted him  and at  the works during the day which followed morange gave alarming signs of  distress  of the final sinking of his mind into a flood of gloom   ever darting troubled glances around him  he was tortured by internal  combats  which  without the slightest motive  made him descend the  stairs a dozen times  linger before the machinery in motion  and then  return to his additions up above  with the bewildered  distracted air  of one who could not find what he sought so painfully  when the darkness  fell  about four o clock on that gloomy winter day  the two clerks whom  he had with him in his office noticed that he altogether ceased working   from that moment  indeed  he waited with his eyes fixed upon the clock   and when five o clock struck he once more made sure that a certain total  was correct  then rose and went out  leaving the ledger open  as if he  meant to return to check the next addition     he followed the gallery which led to the passage connecting the  workshops with the private house  the whole factory was at that hour  lighted up  electric lamps cast the brightness of daylight over it   while the stir of work ascended and the walls shook amid the rumbling  of machinery  and all at once  before reaching the passage  morange  perceived the lift  the terrible cavity  the abyss of murder in which  blaise had met his death fourteen years previously  subsequent to that  catastrophe  and in order to prevent the like of it from ever occurring  again  the trap had been surrounded by a balustrade with a gate  in  such wise that a fall became impossible unless one should open the gate  expressly to take a plunge  at that moment the trap was lowered and the  gate was closed  and morange  yielding to some superior force  bent over  the cavity  shuddering  the whole scene of long ago rose up before him   he was again in the depths of that frightful void  he could see the  crushed corpse  and he could feel the gust of terror chilling him in  the presence of murder  accepted and concealed  since he suffered so  dreadfully  since he could no longer sleep  since he had promised his  dear dead ones that he would join them  why should he not make an end  of himself  two days previously  while leaning over the parapet of  the grenelle bridge  a desire to do so had taken possession of him  he  merely had to lose his equilibrium and he would be liberated  laid to  rest in the peaceful earth between his wife and his daughter  and  all  at once  as if the abyss itself suggested to him the frightful solution  for which he had been vainly groping  in his growing madness  for two  days past  he thought that he could hear a voice calling him from below   the voice of blaise  which cried   come with the other one  come with  the other one      he started violently and drew himself erect  decision had fallen on him  in a lightning flash  insane as he was  that appeared to him to be the  one sole logical  mathematical  sensible solution  which would settle  everything  it seemed to him so simple  too  that he was astonished that  he had sought it so long  and from that moment this poor soft hearted  weakling  whose wretched brain was unhinged  gave proof of iron will and  sovereign heroism  assisted by the clearest reasoning  the most subtle  craft     in the first place he prepared everything  set the catch to prevent the  trap from being sent up again in his absence  and also assured himself  that the balustrade door opened and closed easily  he came and went with  a light  aerial step  as if carried off his feet  with his eyes ever on  the alert  anxious as he was to be neither seen nor heard  at last  he extinguished the three electric lamps and plunged the gallery into  darkness  from below  through the gaping cavity the stir of the working  factory  the rumbling of the machinery ever ascended  and it was only  then  everything being ready  that morange turned into the passage to  betake himself to the little drawing room of the mansion     constance was there waiting for him with alexandre  she had given  instructions for the latter to call half an hour earlier  for she wished  to confess him while as yet telling him nothing of the real position  which she meant him to take in the house  she was not disposed to place  herself all at once at his mercy  and had therefore simply expressed her  willingness to give him employment in accordance with the recommendation  of her relative  the baroness de lowicz  nevertheless  she studied him  with restrained ardor  and was well pleased to find that he was strong   sturdy  and resolute  with a hard face lighted by terrible eyes  which  promised her an avenger  she would finish polishing him up  and then he  would suit her perfectly  for his part  without plainly understanding  the truth  he scented something  divined that his fortune was at hand   and was quite ready to wait awhile for the certain feast  like a young  wolf who consents to be domesticated in order that he may  later on   devour the whole flock at his ease     when morange went in only one thing struck him  alexandre s resemblance  to beauchene  that extraordinary resemblance which had already upset  constance  and which now sent an icy chill through the old accountant as  if in purposing to carry out his idea he had condemned his old master      i was waiting for you  my friend  you are late  you who are so punctual  as a rule   said constance      yes  there was a little work which i wished to finish      but she had merely been jesting  she felt so happy  and she immediately  settled everything   well  here is the gentleman whom i spoke about    she said   you will begin by taking him with you and making him  acquainted with the business  even if in the first instance you can  merely send him about on commissions for you  it is understood  is it  not       quite so  dear madame  i will take him with me  you may rely on me      then  as she gave alexandre his dismissal  saying that he might come on  the morrow  morange offered to show him out by way of his office and the  workshops  which were still open      in that way he will form an acquaintance with the works  and can come  straight to me to morrow      constance laughed again  so fully did the accountant s obligingness  reassure her      that is a good idea  my friend   she said   thank you  and au revoir   monsieur  we will take charge of your future if you behave sensibly      at this moment  however  she was thunderstruck by an extravagant and  seemingly senseless incident  morange  having shown alexandre out of the  little salon  in advance of himself  turned round towards her with the  sudden grimace of a madman  revealing his insanity by the distortion of  his countenance  and in a low  familiar  sneering voice  he stammered in  her face   ha  ha  blaise at the bottom of the hole  he speaks  he has  spoken to me  ha  ha  the somersault  you would have the somersault  and  you shall have it again  the somersault  the somersault      then he disappeared  following alexandre     she had listened to him agape with wonder  it was all so unforeseen  so  idiotic  that at first she did not understand it  but afterwards what a  flash of light came to her  that which morange had referred to was the  murder yonder  the thing to which they had never referred  the monstrous  thing which they had kept buried for fourteen years past  which their  glances only had confessed  but which  all of a sudden  he had cast in  her teeth with the grimace of a madman  what was the meaning of the poor  fool s diabolical rebellion  the dim threat which she had felt passing  like a gust from an abyss  she turned frightfully pale  she intuitively  foresaw some frightful revenge of destiny  that destiny which  only a  moment previously  she had believed to be her minion  yes  it was surely  that  and she felt herself carried fourteen years backward  and she  remained standing  quivering  icy cold  listening to the sounds which  arose from the works  waiting for the awful thud of the fall  even as  on the distant day when she had listened and waited for the other to be  crushed and killed     meantime morange  with his discreet  short step  was leading alexandre  away  and speaking to him in a quiet  good natured voice      i must ask your pardon for going first  but i have to show you the way   oh  this is a very intricate place  with stairs and passages whose turns  and twists never end  the passage now turns to the left  you see      then  on reaching the gallery where the darkness was complete  he  affected anger in the most natural manner possible      ah  well  that is just their way  they haven t yet lighted up this  part  the switch is at the other end  fortunately i know where to step   for i have been going backwards and forwards here for the last forty  years  mind follow me carefully      thereupon  at each successive step  he warned the other what he ought to  do  guiding him along in his obliging way without the faintest tremor in  his voice      don t let go of me  turn to the left   now we merely have to go  straight ahead   only  wait a moment  a barrier intersects the  gallery  and there is a gate   there we are  i m opening the gate  you  hear   follow me  i ll go first      morange quietly stepped into the void  amid the darkness  and  without  a cry  he fell  alexandre who was close in the rear  almost touching him  so as not to lose him  certainly detected the void and the gust which  followed the fall  as with sudden horror the flooring failed beneath  them  but force of motion carried him on  he stepped forward in his  turn  howled and likewise fell  head over heels  both were smashed  below  both killed at once  true  morange still breathed for a few  seconds  alexandre  for his part  lay with his skull broken to pieces  and his brains scattered on the very spot where blaise had been picked  up     horrible was the stupefaction when those bodies were found there  nobody  could explain the catastrophe  morange carried off his secret  the  reason for that savage act of justice which he had accomplished  according to the chance suggestions of his dementia  perhaps he had  wished to punish constance  perhaps he had desired to repair the old  wrong  denis long since stricken in the person of his brother  and now  saved for the sake of his daughter hortense  who would live happily with  margot  the pretty doll who was so good  by suppressing the criminal  instrument the old accountant had indeed averted the possibility of a  fresh crime  swayed by his fixed idea  however  he had doubtless never  reasoned that cataclysmic deed of justice  which was above reason   and which passed by with the impassive savagery of a death dealing  hurricane     at the works there was but one opinion  morange had assuredly been mad   and he alone could have caused the accident  particularly as it was  impossible to account  otherwise than by an act of madness  for the  extinguishing of the lights  the opening of the balustrade door  and  the plunge into the cavity which he knew to be there  and into which  had followed him the unfortunate young man his companion  moreover  the  accountant s madness was no longer doubted by anybody a few days later   when the doorkeeper of his house related his final eccentricities  and  a commissary of police went to search his rooms  he had been mad  mad  enough to be placed in confinement     to begin  nobody had ever seen a flat in such an extraordinary  condition  the kitchen a perfect stable  the drawing room in a state of  utter abandonment with its louis xiv  furniture gray with dust  and the  dining room all topsy turvy  the old oak tables and chairs being piled  up against the window as if to shut out every ray of light  though  nobody could tell why  the only properly kept room was that in which  reine had formerly slept  which was as clean as a sanctuary  with its  pitch pine furniture as bright as if it had been polished every day  but  the apartment in which morange s madness became unmistakably manifest  was his own bedchamber  which he had turned into a museum of souvenirs   covering its walls with photographs of his wife and daughter  above a  table there  the wall facing the window quite disappeared from view   for a sort of little chapel had been set up  decked with a multitude of  portraits  in the centre were photographs of valerie and reine  both  of them at twenty years of age  so that they looked like twin sisters   while symmetrically disposed all around was an extraordinary number of  other portraits  again showing valerie and reine  now as children  now  as girls  and now as women  in every sort of position  too  and every  kind of toilet  and below them on the table  like an offering on an  altar  was found more than one hundred thousand francs  in gold  and  silver  and even copper  indeed  the whole fortune which morange had  been saving up for several years by eating only dry bread  like a  pauper     at last  then  one knew what he had done with his savings  he had given  them to his dead wife and daughter  who had remained his will  passion   and ambition  haunted by remorse at having killed them while dreaming  of making them rich  he reserved for them that money which they had so  keenly desired  and which they would have spent with so much ardor  it  was still and ever for them that he earned it  and he took it to  them  lavished it upon them  never devoting even a tithe of it to any  egotistical pleasure  absorbed as he was in his vision fraught worship  and eager to pacify and cheer their spirits  and the whole neighborhood  gossiped endlessly about the old mad gentleman who had let himself die  of wretchedness by the side of a perfect treasure  piled coin by coin  upon a table  and for twenty years past tendered to the portraits of  his wife and daughter  even as flowers might have been offered to their  memory     about six o clock  when mathieu reached the works  he found the place  terrified by the catastrophe  ever since the morning he had been  rendered anxious by morange s letter  which had greatly surprised and  worried him with that extraordinary story of alexandre turning up  once more  being welcomed by constance  and introduced by her into the  establishment  plain as was the greater part of the letter  it contained  some singularly incoherent passages  and darted from one point to  another with incomprehensible suddenness  mathieu had read it three  times  indulging on each occasion in fresh hypotheses of a gloomier and  gloomier nature  for the more he reflected  the more did the affair  seem to him to be fraught with menace  then  on reaching the rendezvous  appointed by morange  he found himself in presence of those bleeding  bodies which victor moineaud had just picked up and laid out side by  side  silent  chilled to his bones  mathieu listened to his son  denis   who had hastened up to tell him of the unexplainable misfortune  the  two men falling one atop of the other  first the old mad accountant  and  then the young fellow whom nobody knew and who seemed to have dropped  from heaven     mathieu  for his part  had immediately recognized alexandre  and if   pale and terrified  he kept silent on the subject  it was because he  desired to take nobody  not even his son  into his confidence  given the  fresh suppositions  the frightful suppositions  which now arose in his  mind from out of all the darkness  he listened with growing anxiety to  the enumeration of the few points which were certain  the extinguishing  of the electric lights in the gallery and the opening of the balustrade  door  which was always kept closed and could only have been opened  by some habitue  since  to turn the handle  one had to press a secret  spring which kept it from moving  and  all at once  as victor moineaud  pointed out that the old man had certainly been the first to fall   since one of the young man s legs had been stretched across his stomach   mathieu was carried fourteen years backward  he remembered old moineaud  picking up blaise on the very spot where victor  the son  had just  picked up morange and alexandre  blaise  at the thought of his dead boy  fresh light came to mathieu  a frightful suspicion blazed up amid the  terrible obscurity in which he had been groping and doubting  and   thereupon  leaving denis to settle everything down below  he decided to  see constance     up above  however  when mathieu was on the point of turning into the  communicating passage  he paused once more  this time near the lift   it was there  fourteen years previously  that morange  finding the trap  open  had gone down to warn and chide the workmen  while constance   according to her own account  had quietly returned into the house   at the very moment when blaise  coming from the other end of the dim  gallery  plunged into the gulf  everybody had eventually accepted  that narrative as being accurate  but mathieu now felt that it was  mendacious  he could recall various glances  various words  various  spells of silence  and sudden certainty came upon him  a certainty based  on all the petty things which he had not then understood  but which  now assumed the most frightful significance  yes  it was certain  even  though round it there hovered the monstrous vagueness of silent crimes   cowardly crimes  over which a shadow of horrible mystery always lurks   moreover  it explained the sequel  those two bodies lying below  as far   that is  as logical reasoning can explain a madman s action with all its  gaps and mysteriousness  nevertheless  mathieu still strove to doubt   before anything else he wished to see constance     showing a waxy pallor  she had remained erect  motionless  in the middle  of her little drawing room  the waiting of fourteen years previously had  begun once more  lasting on and on  and filling her with such anxiety  that she held her breath the better to listen  nothing  no stir  no  sound of footsteps  had yet ascended from the works  what could be  happening then  was the hateful thing  the dreaded thing  merely a  nightmare after all  yet morange had really sneered in her face  she had  fully understood him  had not a howl  the thud of a fall  just reached  her ears  and now  had not the rumbling of the machinery ceased  it was  death  the factory silent  chilled and lost for her  all at once her  heart ceased beating as she detected a sound of footsteps drawing nearer  and nearer with increased rapidity  the door opened  and it was mathieu  who came in     she recoiled  livid  as at the sight of a ghost  he  o god  why he  how  was it he was there  of all the messengers of misfortune he was the one  whom she had least expected  had the dead son risen before her she would  not have shuddered more dreadfully than she did at this apparition of  the father     she did not speak  he simply said   they made the plunge  they are both  dead  like blaise      then  though she still said nothing  she looked at him  for a moment  their eyes met  and in her glance he read everything  the murder was  begun afresh  effected  consummated  over yonder lay the bodies  dead   one atop of the other      wretched woman  to what monstrous perversity have you fallen  and how  much blood there is upon you      by an effort of supreme pride constance was able to draw herself up and  even increase her stature  still wishing to conquer  and cry aloud that  she was indeed the murderess  that she had always thwarted him  and  would ever do so  but mathieu was already overwhelming her with a final  revelation      you don t know  then  that that ruffian  alexandre  was one of the  murderers of your friend  madame angelin  the poor woman who was robbed  and strangled one winter afternoon  i compassionately hid that from you   but he would now be at the galleys had i spoken out  and if i were to  speak to day you would be there too      that was the hatchet stroke  she did not speak  but dropped  all of a  lump  upon the carpet  like a tree which has been felled  this time her  defeat was complete  destiny  which she awaited  had turned against her  and thrown her to the ground  a mother the less  perverted by the  love which she had set on her one child  a mother duped  robbed   and maddened  who had glided into murder amid the dementia born of  inconsolable motherliness  and now she lay there  stretched out  scraggy  and withered  poisoned by the affection which she had been unable to  bestow     mathieu became anxious  and summoned the old servant  who  after  procuring assistance  carried her mistress to her bed and then undressed  her  meantime  as constance gave no sign of life  seized as she was  by one of those fainting fits which often left her quite breathless   mathieu himself went for boutan  and meeting him just as he was  returning home for dinner  was luckily able to bring him back at once     boutan  who was now nearly seventy two  and was quietly spending  his last years in serene cheerfulness  born of his hope in life  had  virtually ceased practising  only attending a very few old patients   his friends  however  he did not refuse mathieu s request  when he had  examined constance he made a gesture of hopelessness  the meaning of  which was so plain that mathieu  his anxiety increasing  bethought  himself of trying to find beauchene in order that the latter might  at  least  be present if his wife should die  but the old servant  on being  questioned  began by raising her arms to heaven  she did not know where  monsieur might be  monsieur never left any address  at last  feeling  frightened herself  she made up her mind to hasten to the abode of the  two women  aunt and niece  with whom beauchene spent the greater part  of his time  she knew their address perfectly well  as her mistress had  even sent her thither in pressing emergencies  but she learnt that the  ladies had gone with monsieur to nice for a holiday  whereupon  not  desiring to return without some member of the family  she was seized  on her way back with the fine idea of calling on monsieur s sister  the  baroness de lowicz  whom she brought  almost by force  in her cab     it was in vain that boutan attempted treatment  when constance opened  her eyes again  she looked at him fixedly  recognized him  no doubt  and  then lowered her eyelids  and from that moment she obstinately refused  to reply to any question that was put to her  she must have heard and  have known that people were there  trying to succor her  but she would  have none of their succor  she was stubbornly intent on dying  on giving  no further sign of life  neither did she raise her eyelids  nor did her  lips part again  it was as if she had already quitted the world amid the  mute agony of her defeat     that evening seraphine s manner was extremely strange  she reeked  of ether  for she drank ether now  when she heard of the two fold   accident   the death of morange and that of alexandre  which had  brought on constance s cardiacal attack  she simply gave an insane grin   a kind of involuntary snigger  and stammered   ah  that s funny      though she removed neither her hat nor her gloves  she installed herself  in an armchair  where she sat waiting  with her eyes wide open and  staring straight before her  those brown eyes flecked with gold  whose  living light was all that she had retained of her massacred beauty  at  sixty two she looked like a centenarian  her bold  insolent face was  ravined  as it were  by her stormy life  and the glow of her sun like  hair had been extinguished by a shower of ashes  and time went on   midnight approached  and she was still there  near that death bed of  which she seemed to be ignorant  in that quivering chamber where she  forgot herself  similar to a mere thing  apparently no longer even  knowing why she had been brought thither     mathieu and boutan had been unwilling to retire  since monsieur was  at nice in the company of those ladies  the aunt and the niece  they  decided to spend the night there in order that constance might not be  left alone with the old servant  and towards midnight  while they were  chatting together in undertones  they were suddenly stupefied at hearing  seraphine raise her voice  after preserving silence for three hours      he is dead  you know   said she     who was dead  at last they understood that she referred to dr  gaude   the celebrated surgeon  had  indeed  been found in his consulting room  struck down by sudden death  the cause of which was not clearly known   in fact  the strangest  the most horrible and tragical stories were  current on the subject  according to one of them a patient had wreaked  vengeance on the doctor  and mathieu  full of emotion  recalled that one  day  long ago  seraphine herself had suggested that all gaude s unhappy  patients ought to band themselves together and put an end to him     when seraphine perceived that mathieu was gazing at her  as in a  nightmare  moved by the shuddering silence of that death watch  she once  more grinned like a lunatic  and said   he is dead  we were all there      it was insane  improbable  impossible  and yet was it true or was it  false  a cold  terrifying quiver swept by  the icy quiver of mystery  of  that which one knows not  which one will never know     boutan leant towards mathieu and whispered in his ear   she will be  raving mad and shut up in a padded cell before a week is over   and   indeed  a week later the baroness de lowicz was wearing a straight  waistcoat  in her case dr  gaude s treatment had led to absolute  insanity     mathieu and boutan watched beside constance until daybreak  she never  opened her lips  nor raised her eyelids  as the sun rose up  she turned  towards the wall  and then she died           xxii    still more years passed  and mathieu was already sixty eight and  marianne sixty five  when amid the increasing good fortune which they  owed to their faith in life  and their long courageous hopefulness  a  last battle  the most dolorous of their existence  almost struck them  down and sent them to the grave  despairing and inconsolable     one evening marianne went to bed  quivering  utterly distracted  quite a  rending was taking place in the family  a disastrous and hateful quarrel  had set the mill  where gregoire reigned supreme  against the farm which  was managed by gervais and claire  and ambroise  on being selected  as arbiter  had fanned the flames by judging the affair in a purely  business way from his paris counting house  without taking into account  the various passions which were kindled     it was on returning from a secret application to ambroise  prompted by a  maternal longing for peace  that marianne had taken to her bed  wounded  to the heart  and terrified by the thought of the future  ambroise had  received her roughly  almost brutally  and she had gone back home in a  state of intense anguish  feeling as if her own flesh were lacerated  by the quarrelling of her ungrateful sons  and she had kept her bed   begging mathieu to say nothing  and explaining that a doctor s services  would be useless  since she did not suffer from any malady  she was  fading away  however  as he could well detect  she was day by day taking  leave of him  carried off by her bitter grief  was it possible that all  those loving and well loved children  who had grown up under their care  and their caresses  who had become the joy and pride of their victory   all those children born of their love  united in their fidelity  a  sacred brotherly  sisterly battalion gathered close around them  was it  possible that they should now disband and desperately seek to destroy  one another  if so  it was true  then  that the more a family increases   the greater is the harvest of ingratitude  and still more accurate  became the saying  that to judge of any human being s happiness or  unhappiness in life  one must wait until he be dead      ah   said mathieu  as he sat near marianne s bed  holding her feverish  hand   to think of it  to have struggled so much  and to have triumphed  so much  and then to encounter this supreme grief  which will bring  us more pain than all the others  decidedly it is true that one must  continue battling until one s last breath  and that happiness is only  to be won by suffering and tears  we must still hope  still triumph  and  conquer and live      marianne  however  had lost all courage  and seemed to be overwhelmed      no   said she   i have no energy left me  i am vanquished  i was always  able to heal the wounds which came from without  but this wound comes  from my own blood  my blood pours forth within me and stifles me  all  our work is destroyed  our joy  our health  our strength  have at the  last day become mere lies      then mathieu  whom her grievous fears of a disaster gained  went off to  weep in the adjoining room  already picturing his wife dead and himself  in utter solitude     it was with reference to lepailleur s moorland  the plots intersecting  the chantebled estate  that the wretched quarrel had broken out between  the mill and the farm  for many years already  the romantic  ivy covered  old mill  with its ancient mossy wheel  had ceased to exist  gregoire   at last putting his father s ideas into execution  had thrown it down  to replace it by a large steam mill  with spacious meal stores which  a light railway line connected with janville station  and he himself   since he had been making a big fortune  for all the wheat of the  district was now sent to him  had greatly changed  with nothing of his  youthful turbulence left save a quick temper  which his wife therese  with her brave  loving heart alone could somewhat calm  on a score of  occasions he had almost broken off all relations with his father in law   lepailleur  who certainly abused his seventy years  though the old  miller  in spite of all his prophecies of ruin  had been unable to  prevent the building of the new establishment  he none the less sneered  and jeered at it  exasperated as he was at having been in the wrong   he had  in fact  been beaten for the second time  not only did the  prodigious crops of chantebled disprove his theory of the bankruptcy  of the earth  that villainous earth in which  like an obstinate peasant  weary of toil and eager for speedy fortune  he asserted nothing more  would grow  but now that mill of his  which he had so disdained  was  born as it were afresh  growing to a gigantic size  and becoming in his  son in law s hands an instrument of great wealth     the worst was that lepailleur so stubbornly lived on  experiencing  continual defeats  but never willing to acknowledge that he was beaten   one sole delight remained to him  the promise given and kept by gregoire  that he would not sell the moorland enclosure to the farm  the old man  had even prevailed on him to leave it uncultivated  and the sight of  that sterile tract intersecting the wavy greenery of the beautiful  estate of chantebled  like a spot of desolation  well pleased his  spiteful nature  he was often to be seen strolling there  like an old  king of the stones and the brambles  drawing up his tall  scraggy figure  as if he were quite proud of the poverty of that soil  in going thither  one of his objects doubtless was to find a pretext for a quarrel  for it  was he who in the course of one of these promenades  when he displayed  such provoking insolence  discovered an encroachment on the part of the  farm  an encroachment which his comments magnified to such a degree that  disastrous consequences seemed probable  as it was  all the happiness of  the froments was for a time destroyed     in business matters gregoire invariably showed the rough impulsiveness  of a man of sanguine temperament  obstinately determined to part with  no fraction of his rights  when his father in law told him that the  farm had impudently cleared some seven acres of his moorland  with the  intention no doubt of carrying this fine robbery even further  if it  were not promptly stopped  gregoire at once decided to inquire into the  matter  declaring that he would not tolerate any invasion of that sort   the misfortune then was that no boundary stones could be found  thus   the people of the farm might assert that they had made a mistake in  all good faith  or even that they had remained within their limits  but  lepailleur ragefully maintained the contrary  entered into particulars   and traced what he declared to be the proper frontier line with his  stick  swearing that within a few inches it was absolutely correct   however  matters went altogether from bad to worse after an interview  between the brothers  gervais and gregoire  in the course of which the  latter lost his temper and indulged in unpardonable language  on the  morrow  too  he began an action at law  to which gervais replied by  threatening that he would not send another grain of corn to be ground  at the mill  and this rupture of business relations meant serious  consequences for the mill  which really owed its prosperity to the  custom of chantebled     from that moment matters grew worse each day  and conciliation soon  seemed to be out of the question  for ambroise  on being solicited to  find a basis of agreement  became in his turn impassioned  and even  ended by enraging both parties  thus the hateful ravages of that  fratricidal war were increased  there were now three brothers up in arms  against one another  and did not this forebode the end of everything   might not this destructive fury gain the whole family  overwhelming it  as with a blast of folly and hatred after so many years of sterling good  sense and strong and healthy affection     mathieu naturally tried to intervene  but at the very outset he felt  that if he should fail  if his paternal authority should be disregarded   the disaster would become irreparable  without renouncing the struggle   he therefore waited for some opportunity which he might turn to good  account  at the same time  each successive day of discord increased his  anxiety  it was really all his own life work  the little people which  had sprung from him  the little kingdom which he had founded under the  benevolent sun  that was threatened with sudden ruin  a work such as  this can only live by force of love  the love which created it can alone  perpetuate it  it crumbles as soon as the bond of fraternal solidarity  is broken  thus it seemed to mathieu that instead of leaving his work  behind him in full florescence of kindliness  joy  and vigor  he would  see it cast to the ground in fragments  soiled  and dead even before he  were dead himself  yet what a fruitful and prosperous work had hitherto  been that estate of chantebled  whose overflowing fertility increased  at each successive harvest  and that mill too  so enlarged and so  flourishing  which was the outcome of his own inspiring suggestions   to say nothing of the prodigious fortunes which his conquering sons had  acquired in paris  yet it was all this admirable work  which faith in  life had created  that a fratricidal onslaught upon life was about to  destroy     one evening  in the mournful gloaming of one of the last days of  september  the couch on which marianne lay dying of silent grief was  by  her desire  rolled to the window  charlotte alone nursed her  and of  all her sons she had but the last one  benjamin  beside her in the now  over spacious house which had replaced the old shooting box  since the  family had been at war she had kept the doors closed  intent on opening  them only to her children when they became reconciled  if they should  then seek to make her happy by coming to embrace one another beneath her  roof  but she virtually despaired of that sole cure for her grief  the  only joy that would make her live again     that evening  as mathieu came to sit beside her  and they lingered there  hand in hand according to their wont  they did not at first speak  but  gazed straight before them at the spreading plain  at the estate  whose  interminable fields blended with the mist far away  at the mill yonder  on the banks of the yeuse  with its tall  smoking chimney  and at paris  itself on the horizon  where a tawny cloud was rising as from the huge  furnace of some forge     the minutes slowly passed away  during the afternoon mathieu had taken  a long walk in the direction of the farms of mareuil and lillebonne   in the hope of quieting his torment by physical fatigue  and in a low  voice  as if speaking to himself  he at last said      the ploughing could not take place under better conditions  yonder on  the plateau the quality of the soil has been much improved by the recent  methods of cultivation  and here  too  on the slopes  the sandy soil  has been greatly enriched by the new distribution of the springs which  gervais devised  the estate has almost doubled in value since it has  been in his hands and claire s  there is no break in the prosperity   labor yields unlimited victory       what is the good of it if there is no more love   murmured marianne      then  too   continued mathieu  after a pause   i went down to the  yeuse  and from a distance i saw that gregoire had received the new  machine which denis has just built for him  it was being unloaded in the  yard  it seems that it imparts a certain movement to the mill stones   which saves a good third of the power needed  with such appliances the  earth may produce seas of corn for innumerable nations  they will all  have bread  and that mill engine  with its regular breath and motion   will produce fresh wealth also       what use is it if people hate one another   marianne exclaimed     at this mathieu dropped the subject  but  in accordance with a  resolution which he had formed during his walk  he told his wife that  he meant to go to paris on the morrow  and on noticing her surprise   he pretended that he wished to see to a certain business matter  the  settlement of an old account  but the truth was  that he could no longer  endure the spectacle of his wife s lingering agony  which brought him  so much suffering  he wished to act  to make a supreme effort at  reconciliation     at ten o clock on the following morning  when mathieu alighted from the  train at the paris terminus  he drove direct to the factory at grenelle   before everything else he wished to see denis  who had hitherto taken no  part in the quarrel  for a long time now  indeed ever since constance s  death  denis had been installed in the house on the quay with his  wife marthe and their three children  this occupation of the luxurious  dwelling set apart for the master had been like a final entry into  possession  with respect to the whole works  true  beauchene had lived  several years longer  but his name no longer figured in that of the  firm  he had surrendered his last shred of interest in the business for  an annuity  and at last one evening it was learnt that he had died that  day  struck down by an attack of apoplexy after an over copious lunch   at the residence of his lady friends  the aunt and the niece  he had  previously been sinking into a state of second childhood  the outcome  of his life of fast and furious pleasure  and this  then  was the end  of the egotistical debauchee  ever going from bad to worse  and finally  swept into the gutter      why  what good wind has blown you here   cried denis gayly  when he  perceived his father   have you come to lunch  i m still a bachelor  you  know  for it is only next monday that i shall go to fetch marthe and the  children from dieppe  where they have spent a delightful september      then  on hearing that his mother was ailing  even in danger  he become  serious and anxious      mamma ill  and in danger  you amaze me  i thought she was simply  troubled with some little indisposition  but come  father  what is  really the matter  are you hiding something  is something worrying you      thereupon he listened to the plain and detailed statement which mathieu  felt obliged to make to him  and he was deeply moved by it  as if the  dread of the catastrophe which it foreshadowed would henceforth upset  his life   what   he angrily exclaimed   my brothers are up to these  fine pranks with their idiotic quarrel  i knew that they did not get  on well together  i had heard of things which saddened me  but i never  imagined that matters had gone so far  and that you and mamma were so  affected that you had shut yourselves up and were dying of it all  but  things must be set to rights  one must see ambroise at once  let us go  and lunch with him  and finish the whole business      before starting he had a few orders to give  so mathieu went down to  wait for him in the factory yard  and there  during the ten minutes  which he spent walking about dreamily  all the distant past arose before  his eyes  he could see himself a mere clerk  crossing that courtyard  every morning on his arrival from janville  with thirty sous for his  lunch in his pocket  the spot had remained much the same  there was the  central building  with its big clock  the workshops and the sheds  quite  a little town of gray structures  surmounted by two lofty chimneys   which were ever smoking  true  his son had enlarged this city of toil   the stretch of ground bordered by the rue de la federation and the  boulevard de grenelle had been utilized for the erection of other  buildings  and facing the quay there still stood the large brick house  with dressings of white stone  of which constance had been so proud   and where  with the mien of some queen of industry  she had received her  friends in her little salon hung with yellow silk  eight hundred men now  worked in the place  the ground quivered with the ceaseless trepidation  of machinery  the establishment had grown to be the most important  of its kind in paris  the one whence came the finest agricultural  appliances  the most powerful mechanical workers of the soil  and it  was his  mathieu s  son whom fortune had made prince of that branch of  industry  and it was his daughter in law who  with her three strong   healthy children near her  received her friends in the little salon hung  with yellow silk     as mathieu  moved by his recollections  glanced towards the right   towards the pavilion where he had dwelt with marianne  and where gervais  had been born  an old workman who passed  lifted his cap to him  saying    good day  monsieur froment      mathieu thereupon recognized victor moineaud  now five and fifty years  old  and aged  and wrecked by labor to even a greater degree than his  father had been at the time when mother moineaud had come to offer the  monster her children s immature flesh  entering the works at sixteen  years of age  victor  like his father  had spent forty years between  the forge and the anvil  it was iniquitous destiny beginning afresh   the most crushing toil falling upon a beast of burden  the son hebetated  after the father  ground to death under the millstones of wretchedness  and injustice      good day  victor   said mathieu   are you well       oh  i m no longer young  monsieur froment   the other replied   i shall  soon have to look somewhere for a hole to lie in  still  i hope it won t  be under an omnibus      he alluded to the death of his father  who had finally been picked up  under an omnibus in the rue de grenelle  with his skull split and both  legs broken      but after all   resumed victor   one may as well die that way as any  other  it s even quicker  the old man was lucky in having norine and  cecile to look after him  if it hadn t been for them  it s starvation  that would have killed him  not an omnibus      mathieu interrupted   are norine and cecile well   he asked      yes  monsieur froment  leastways  as far as i know  for  as you can  understand  we don t often see one another  them and me  that s about  all that s left out of our lot  for irma won t have anything more to do  with us since she s become one of the toffs  euphrasie was lucky enough  to die  and that brigand alfred disappeared  which was real relief  i  assure you  for i feared that i should be seeing him at the galleys  and  i was really pleased when i had some news of norine and cecile lately   norine is older than i am  you know  she will soon be sixty  but she  was always strong  and her boy  it seems  looks after her  both she and  cecile still work  yes  cecile still lives on  though one used to think  that a fillip would have killed her  it s a pretty home  that one of  theirs  two mothers for a big lad of whom they ve made a decent fellow      mathieu nodded approvingly  and then remarked   but you yourself   victor  had boys and girls who must now in their turn be fathers and  mothers      the old workman waved his hand vaguely      yes   said he   i had eight  one more than my father  they ve all  gone off  and they are fathers and mothers in their turn  as you say   monsieur froment  it s all chance  you know  one has to live  there are  some of them who certainly don t eat white bread  ah  that they don t   and the question is whether  when my arms fail me  i shall find one to  take me in  as norine and cecile took my father  but when everything s  said  what can you expect  it s all seed of poverty  it can t grow well   or yield anything good      for a moment he remained silent  then resuming his walk towards the  works  with bent  weary back and hanging hands  dented by toil  he said    au revoir  monsieur froment       au revoir  victor   mathieu answered in a kindly tone     having given his orders  denis now came to join his father  and proposed  to him that they should go on foot to the avenue d antin  on the way he  warned him that they would certainly find ambroise alone  for his  wife and four children were still at dieppe  where  indeed  the two  sisters in law  andree and marthe  had spent the season together     in a period of ten years  ambroise s fortune had increased tenfold   though he was barely five and forty  he reigned over the paris market   with his spirit of enterprise  he had greatly enlarged the business  left him by old du hordel  transforming it into a really universal   comptoir   through which passed merchandise from all parts of the  world  frontiers did not exist for ambroise  he enriched himself with  the spoils of the earth  particularly striving to extract from the  colonies all the wealth they were able to yield  and carrying on his  operations with such triumphant audacity  such keen perception  that the  most hazardous of his campaigns ended victoriously     a man of this stamp  whose fruitful activity was ever winning battles   was certain to devour the idle  impotent seguins  in the downfall of  their fortune  the dispersal of the home and family  he had carved a  share for himself by securing possession of the house in the avenue  d antin  seguin himself had not resided there for years  he had thought  it original to live at his club  where he secured accommodation after he  and his wife had separated by consent  two of the children had also gone  off  gaston  now a major in the army  was on duty in a distant garrison  town  and lucie was cloistered in an ursuline convent  thus  valentine   left to herself and feeling very dreary  no longer able  moreover  to  keep up the establishment on a proper footing  in her turn quitted  the mansion for a cheerful and elegant little flat on the boulevard  malesherbes  where she finished her life as a very devout old lady   presiding over a society for providing poor mothers with baby linen  and  thus devoting herself to the children of others  she who had not known  how to bring up her own  and  in this wise  ambroise had simply had to  take possession of the empty mansion  which was heavily mortgaged  to  such an extent  indeed  that when the seguins died their heirs would  certainly be owing him money     many were the recollections which awoke when mathieu  accompanied by  denis  entered that princely mansion of the avenue d antin  there  as at  the factory  he could see himself arriving in poverty  as a needy tenant  begging his landlord to repair a roof  in order that the rain might no  longer pour down on the four children  whom  with culpable improvidence   he already had to provide for  there  facing the avenue  was the  sumptuous renaissance facade with eight lofty windows on each of its  upper floors  there  inside  was the hall  all bronze and marble   conducting to the spacious ground floor reception rooms which a winter  garden prolonged  and there  up above  occupying all the central part of  the first floor  was seguin s former  cabinet   the vast apartment with  lofty windows of old stained glass  mathieu could well remember  that room with its profuse and amusing display of  antiquities   old  brocades  old goldsmith s ware and old pottery  and its richly bound  books  and its famous modern pewters  and he remembered it also at a  later date  in the abandonment to which it had fallen  the aspect of  ruin which it had assumed  covered  as it was  with gray dust which  bespoke the slow crumbling of the home  and now he found it once more  superb and cheerful  renovated with healthier and more substantial  luxury by ambroise  who had put masons and joiners and upholsterers into  it for a period of three months  the whole mansion now lived afresh   more luxurious than ever  filled at winter time with sounds of  festivity  enlivened by the laughter of four happy children  and the  blaze of a living fortune which effort and conquest ever renewed  and  it was no longer seguin  the idler  the artisan of nothingness  whom  mathieu came to see there  it was his own son ambroise  a man of  creative energy  whose victory had been sought by the very forces of  life  which had made him triumph there  installed him as the master in  the home of the vanquished     when mathieu and denis arrived ambroise was absent  but was expected  home for lunch  they waited for him  and as the former again crossed  the ante room the better to judge of some new arrangements that had been  made  he was surprised at being stopped by a lady who was sitting there  patiently  and whom he had not previously noticed      i see that monsieur froment does not recognize me   she said     mathieu made a vague gesture  the woman had a tall  plump figure  and  was certainly more than sixty years of age  but she evidently took care  of her person  and had a smiling mien  with a long  full face and  almost venerable white hair  one might have taken her for some worthy   well to do provincial bourgeoise in full dress      celeste   said she   celeste  madame seguin s former maid      thereupon he fully recognized her  but hid his stupefaction at finding  her so fortunately circumstanced at the close of her career  he had  imagined that she was buried in some sewer     in a gay  placid way she proceeded to recount her happiness   oh  i am  very pleased   she said   i had retired to rougemont  my birth place   and i ended by there marrying a retired naval officer  who has a very  comfortable pension  not to speak of a little fortune which his first  wife left him  as he has two big sons  i ventured to recommend the  younger one to monsieur ambroise  who was kind enough to take him into  his counting house  and so i have profited by my first journey to paris  since then  to come and give monsieur ambroise my best thanks      she did not say how she had managed to marry the retired naval officer   how she had originally been a servant in his household  and how she  had hastened his first wife s death in order to marry him  all things  considered  however  she rendered him very happy  and even rid him of  his sons  who were in his way  thanks to the relations she had kept up  in paris     she continued smiling like a worthy woman  whose feelings softened at  the recollection of the past   you can have no idea how pleased i felt  when i saw you pass just now  monsieur froment   she resumed   ah  it  was a long time ago that i first had the honor of seeing you here  you  remember la couteau  don t you  she was always complaining  was she not   but she is very well pleased now  she and her husband have retired to  a pretty little house of their own  with some little savings which they  live on very quietly  she is no longer young  but she has buried a good  many in her time  and she ll bury more before she has finished  for  instance  madame menoux  you must surely remember madame menoux  the  little haberdasher close by  well  there was a woman now who never had  any luck  she lost her second child  and she lost that big fellow  her  husband  whom she was so fond of  and she herself died of grief six  months afterwards  i did at one time think of taking her to rougemont   where the air is so good for one s health  there are old folks of ninety  living there  take la couteau  for instance  she will live as long  as she likes  oh  yes  it is a very pleasant part indeed  a perfect  paradise      at these words the abominable rougemont  the bloody rougemont  arose  before mathieu s eyes  rearing its peaceful steeple above the low  plain  with its cemetery paved with little parisians  where wild flowers  bloomed and hid the victims of so many murders     but celeste was rattling on again  saying   you remember madame bourdieu  whom you used to know in the rue de miromesnil  she died very near  our village on some property where she went to live when she gave up  business  a good many years ago  she was luckier than her colleague la  rouche  who was far too good natured with people  you must have read  about her case in the newspapers  she was sent to prison with a medical  man named sarraille       la rouche  sarraille   yes  mathieu had certainly read the trial of  those two social pests  who were fated to meet at last in their work of  iniquity  and what an echo did those names awaken in the past  valerie  morange  reine morange  already in the factory yard mathieu had fancied  that he could see the shadow of morange gliding past him  the punctual   timid  soft hearted accountant  whom misfortune and insanity had carried  off into the darkness  and suddenly the unhappy man here again appeared  to mathieu  like a wandering phantom  the restless victim of all the  imbecile ambition  all the desperate craving for pleasure which animated  the period  a poor  weak  mediocre being  so cruelly punished for the  crimes of others  that he was doubtless unable to sleep in the tomb  into which he had flung himself  bleeding  with broken limbs  and before  mathieu s eyes there likewise passed the spectre of seraphine  with  the fierce and pain fraught face of one who is racked and killed by  insatiate desire      well  excuse me for having ventured to stop you  monsieur froment    celeste concluded   but i am very  very pleased at having met you  again      he was still looking at her  and as he quitted her he said  with the  indulgence born of his optimism   may you keep happy since you are  happy  happiness must know what it does      nevertheless  mathieu remained disturbed  as he thought of the apparent  injustice of impassive nature  the memory of his marianne  struck down  by such deep grief  pining away through the impious quarrels of her  sons  returned to him  and as ambroise at last came in and gayly  embraced him  after receiving celeste s thanks  he felt a thrill of  anguish  for the decisive moment which would save or wreck the family  was now at hand     indeed  denis  after inviting himself and mathieu to lunch  promptly  plunged into the subject      we are not here for the mere pleasure of lunching with you   said he    mamma is ill  did you know it       ill   said ambroise   not seriously ill       yes  very ill  in danger  and are you aware that she has been ill  like this ever since she came to speak to you about the quarrel between  gregoire and gervais  when it seems that you treated her very roughly       i treated her roughly  we simply talked business  and perhaps i spoke  to her like a business man  a little bluntly      then ambroise turned towards mathieu  who was waiting  pale and silent    is it true  father  that mamma is ill and causes you anxiety      and as his father replied with a long affirmative nod  he gave vent to  his emotion  even as denis had done at the works immediately on learning  the truth      but dash it all   he said   this affair is becoming quite idiotic  in  my opinion gregoire is right and gervais wrong  only i don t care a fig  about that  they must make it up at once  so that poor mamma may not  have another moment s suffering  but then  why did you shut yourselves  up  why did you not let us know how grieved you were  every one would  have reflected and understood things      then  all at once  ambroise embraced his father with that promptness of  decision which he displayed to such happy effect in business as soon as  ever a ray of light illumined his mind      after all  father   said he   you are the cleverest  you understand  things and foresee them  even if gregoire were within his rights in  bringing an action against gervais  it would be idiotic for him to do  so  because far above any petty private interest  there is the interest  of all of us  the interest of the family  which is to remain  united   compact  and unattackable  if it desires to continue invincible  our  sovereign strength lies in our union  and so it s simple enough  we  will lunch as quickly as possible and take the first train  we shall  go  denis and i  to chantebled with you  peace must be concluded this  evening  i will see to it      laughing  and well pleased to find his own feelings shared by his two  sons  mathieu returned ambroise s embrace  and while waiting for lunch  to be served  they went down to see the winter garden  which was being  enlarged for some fetes which ambroise wished to give  he took pleasure  in adding to the magnificence of the mansion  and in reigning there with  princely pomp  at lunch he apologized for only offering his father  and brother a bachelor s pot luck  though  truth to tell  the fare was  excellent  indeed  whenever andree and the children absented themselves   ambroise still kept a good cook to minister to his needs  for he held  the cuisine of restaurants in horror      well  for my part   said denis   i go to a restaurant for my meals  for  since marthe and all the others have been at dieppe  i have virtually  shut up the house       you are a wise man  you see   ambroise answered  with quiet frankness    for my part  as you are aware  i am an enjoyer  now  make haste and  drink your coffee  and we will start      they reached janville by the two o clock train  their plan was to repair  to chantebled in the first instance  in order that ambroise and denis  might begin by talking to gervais  who was of a gentler nature than  gregoire  and with whom they thought they might devise some means of  conciliation  then they intended to betake themselves to the mill   lecture gregoire  and impose on him such peace conditions as they might  have agreed upon  as they drew nearer and nearer to the farm  however   the difficulties of their undertaking appeared to them  and seemed to  increase in magnitude  an arrangement would not be arrived at so easily  as they had at first imagined  so they girded their loins in readiness  for a hard battle      suppose we begin by going to see mamma   denis suggested   we should  see and embrace her  and that would give us some courage      ambroise deemed the idea an excellent one   yes  let us go by all means   particularly as mamma has always been a good counsellor  she must have  some idea      they climbed to the first floor of the house  to the spacious room  where marianne spent her days on a couch beside the window  and to their  stupefaction they found her seated on that couch with gregoire standing  by her and holding both her hands  while on the other side were gervais  and claire  laughing softly      why  what is this   exclaimed ambroise in amazement   the work is  done       and we who despaired of being able to accomplish it   declared denis   with a gesture of bewilderment     mathieu was equally stupefied and delighted  and on noticing the  surprise occasioned by the arrival of the two big brothers from paris   he proceeded to explain the position      i went to paris this morning to fetch them   he said   and i ve brought  them here to reconcile us all      a joyous peal of laughter resounded  the big brothers were too  late  neither their wisdom nor their diplomacy had been needed  they  themselves made merry over it  feeling the while greatly relieved that  the victory should have been won without any battle     marianne  whose eyes were moist  and who felt divinely happy  so happy  that she seemed already well again  simply replied to mathieu   you see   my friend  it s done  but as yet i know nothing further  gregoire came  here and kissed me  and wished me to send for gervais and claire at  once  then  of his own accord  he told them that they were all three  mad in causing me such grief  and that they ought to come to an  understanding together  thereupon they kissed one another  and now it s  done  it s all over      but gregoire gayly intervened   wait a moment  just listen  i cut too  fine a figure in the story as mamma relates it  and i must tell you the  truth  i wasn t the first to desire the reconciliation  the first was  my wife  therese  she has a good sterling heart and the very brains of a  mule  in such wise that whenever she is determined on anything i always  have to do it in the end  well  yesterday evening we had a bit of a  quarrel  for she had heard  i don t know how  that mamma was ill with  grief  and this pained her  and she tried to prove to me how stupid the  quarrel was  for we should all of us lose by it  this morning she began  again  and of course she convinced me  more particularly as  with the  thought of poor mamma lying ill through our fault  i had hardly slept  all night  but father lepailleur still had to be convinced  and therese  undertook to do that also  she even hit upon something extraordinary  so  that the old man might imagine that he was the conqueror of conquerors   she persuaded him at last to sell you that terrible enclosure at such  an insane price that he will be able to shout  victory   over all the  house tops      then turning to his brother and sister  gregoire added  in a jocular  tone   my dear gervais  my dear claire  let yourselves be robbed  i beg  of you  the peace of my home is at stake  give my father in law the last  joy of believing that he alone has always been in the right  and that we  have never been anything but fools       oh  as much money as he likes   replied gervais  laughing   besides   that enclosure has always been a dishonor for the estate  streaking  it with stones and brambles  like a nasty sore  we have long dreamt  of seeing the property spotless  with its crops waving without a break  under the sun  and chantebled is rich enough to pay for its glory      thus the affair was settled  the wheat of the farm would return to the  mill to be ground  and the mother would get well again  it was the force  of life  the need of love  the union necessary for the whole family if  it were to continue victorious  that had imposed true brotherliness  on the sons  who for a moment had been foolish enough to destroy their  power by assailing one another     the delight of finding themselves once more together there  denis   ambroise  gervais  gregoire  the four big brothers  and claire  the big  sister  all reconciled and again invincible  increased when charlotte  arrived  bringing with her the other three daughters  louise  madeleine   and marthe  who had married and settled in the district  louise  having  heard that her mother was ill  had gone to fetch her sisters  in order  that they might repair to chantebled together  and what a hearty laugh  there was when the procession entered      let them all come   cried ambroise  in a jocular way   let s have the  family complete  a real meeting of the great privy council  you see   mamma  you must get well at once  the whole of your court is at your  knees  and unanimously decides that it can no longer allow you to have  even a headache      then  as benjamin put in an appearance the very last  behind the three  sisters  the laughter broke out afresh      and to think that we were forgetting benjamin   mathieu exclaimed      come  little one  come and kiss me in your turn   said marianne  affectionately  in a low voice   the others jest because you are the  last of the brood  but if i spoil you that only concerns ourselves  does  it not  tell them that you spent the morning with me  and that if you  went out for a walk it was because i wished you to do so      benjamin smiled with a gentle and rather sad expression   but i was  downstairs  mamma  i saw them go up one after the other  i waited for  them all to kiss  before coming up in my turn      he was already one and twenty and extremely handsome  with a bright  face  large brown eyes  long curly hair  and a frizzy  downy beard   though he had never been ill  his mother would have it that he was weak   and insisted on coddling him  all of them  moreover  were very fond  of him  both for his grace of person and the gentle charm of his  disposition  he had grown up in a kind of dream  full of a desire which  he could not put into words  ever seeking the unknown  something which  he knew not  did not possess  and when his parents saw that he had no  taste for any profession  and that even the idea of marrying did  not appeal to him  they evinced no anger  but  on the contrary  they  secretly plotted to keep this son  their last born  life s final gift   to themselves  had they not surrendered all the others  would they not  be forgiven for yielding to the egotism of love by reserving one for  themselves  one who would be theirs entirely  who would never marry  or  toil and moil  but would merely live beside them and love them  and be  loved in return  this was the dream of their old age  the share which   in return for long fruitfulness  they would have liked to snatch  from devouring life  which  though it gives one everything  yet takes  everything away      oh  just listen  benjamin   ambroise suddenly resumed   you are  interested in our brave nicolas  i know  would you like to have some  news of him  i heard from him only the day before yesterday  and it s  right that i should speak of him  since he s the only one of the brood   as mamma puts it  who cannot be here      benjamin at once became quite excited  asking   is it true  has he  written to you  what does he say  what is he doing      he could never think without emotion of nicolas s departure for senegal   he was twelve years old at that time  and nearly nine years had gone by  since then  yet the scene  with that eternal farewell  that flight  as  it were  into the infinite of time and hope  was ever present in his  mind      you know that i have business relations with nicolas   resumed  ambroise   oh  if we had but a few fellows as intelligent and courageous  as he is in our colonies  we should soon rake in all the scattered  wealth of those virgin lands  well  nicolas  as you are aware  went to  senegal with lisbeth  who was the very companion and helpmate he needed   thanks to the few thousand francs which they possessed between them   they soon established a prosperous business  but i divined that the  field was still too small for them  and that they dreamt of clearing and  conquering a larger expanse  and now  all at once  nicolas writes to me  that he is starting for the soudan  the valley of the niger  which has  only lately been opened  he is taking his wife and his four children  with him  and they are all going off to conquer as fortune may will  it  like valiant pioneers beset by the idea of founding a new world  i  confess that it amazes me  for it is a very hazardous enterprise  but  all the same one must admit that our nicolas is a very plucky fellow   and one can t help admiring his great energy and faith in thus setting  out for an almost unknown region  fully convinced that he will subject  and populate it      silence fell  a great gust seemed to have swept by  the gust of the  infinite coming from the far away mysterious virgin plains  and the  family could picture that young fellow  one of themselves  going off  through the deserts  carrying the good seed of humanity under the  spreading sky into unknown climes      ah   said benjamin softly  his eyes dilating and gazing far  far away  as if to the world s end   ah  he s happy  for he sees other rivers  and  other forests  and other suns than ours      but marianne shuddered   no  no  my boy   said she   there are no other  rivers than the yeuse  no other forests but our woods of lillebonne   no other sun but that of chantebled  come and kiss me again  let us  all kiss once more  and i shall get well  and we shall never be parted  again      the laughter began afresh with the embraces  it was a great day  a day  of victory  the most decisive victory which the family had ever won by  refusing to let discord destroy it  henceforth it would be invincible     at twilight  on the evening of that day  mathieu and marianne again  found themselves  as on the previous evening  hand in hand near the  window whence they could see the estate stretching to the horizon  that  horizon behind which arose the breath of paris  the tawny cloud of its  gigantic forge  but how little did that serene evening resemble the  other  and how great was their present felicity  their trust in the  goodness of their work      do you feel better   mathieu asked his wife   do you feel your strength  returning  does your heart beat more freely       oh  my friend  i feel cured  i was only pining with grief  to morrow i  shall be strong      then mathieu sank into a deep reverie  as he sat there face to face with  his conquest  that estate which spread out under the setting sun   and again  as in the morning  did recollections crowd upon him  he  remembered a morning more than forty years previously when he had  left marianne  with thirty sous in her purse  in the little tumbledown  shooting box on the verge of the woods  they lived there on next to  nothing  they owed money  they typified gay improvidence with the four  little mouths which they already had to feed  those children who had  sprung from their love  their faith in life     then he recalled his return home at night time  the three hundred  francs  a month s salary  which he had carried in his pocket  the  calculations which he had made  the cowardly anxiety which he had felt   disturbed as he was by the poisonous egotism which he had encountered  in paris  there were the beauchenes  with their factory  and their only  son  maurice  whom they were bringing up to be a future prince  the  beauchenes  who had prophesied to him that he and his wife and their  troop of children could only expect a life of black misery  and death in  a garret  there were also the seguins  then his landlords  who had shown  him their millions  and their magnificent mansion  full of treasures   crushing him the while  treating him with derisive pity because he did  not behave sensibly like themselves  who were content with having but  two children  a boy and a girl  and even those poor moranges had talked  to him of giving a royal dowry to their one daughter reine  dreaming at  that time of an appointment that would bring in twelve thousand francs  a year  and full of contempt for the misery which a numerous family  entails  and then the very lepailleurs  the people of the mill  had  evinced distrust because there were twelve francs owing to them for milk  and eggs  for it had seemed to them doubtful whether a bourgeois  insane  enough to have so many children  could possibly pay his debts  ah  the  views of the others had then appeared to be correct  he had repeated to  himself that he would never have a factory  nor a mansion  nor even a  mill  and that in all probability he would never earn twelve thousand  francs a year  the others had everything and he nothing  the others  the  rich  behaved sensibly  and did not burden themselves with offspring   whereas  he  the poor man  already had more children than he could  provide for  what madness it had seemed to be     but forty years had rolled away  and behold his madness was wisdom  he  had conquered by his divine improvidence  the poor man had vanquished  the wealthy  he had placed his trust in the future  and now the whole  harvest was garnered  the beauchene factory was his through his son  denis  the seguins  mansion was his through his son ambroise  the  lepailleurs  mill was his through his son gregoire  tragical  even  excessive punishment  had blown those sorry moranges away in a tempest  of blood and insanity  and other social wastage had swept by and rolled  into the gutter  seraphine  the useless creature  had succumbed to  her passions  the moineauds had been dispersed  annihilated by their  poisonous environment  and he  mathieu  and marianne alone remained  erect  face to face with that estate of chantebled  which they had  conquered from the seguins  and where their children  gervais and  claire  at present reigned  prolonging the dynasty of their race  this  was their kingdom  as far as the eye could see the fields spread out  with wondrous fertility under the sun s farewell  proclaiming the  battles  the heroic creative labor of their lives  there was their work   there was what they had produced  whether in the realm of animate or  inanimate nature  thanks to the power of love within them  and their  energy of will  by love  and resolution  and action  they had created a  world      look  look   murmured mathieu  waving his arm   all that has sprung  from us  and we must continue to love  we must continue to be happy  in  order that it may all live       ah   marianne gayly replied   it will live forever now  since we have  all become reconciled and united amid our victory      victory  yes  it was the natural  necessary victory that is reaped by  the numerous family  thanks to numbers they had ended by invading every  sphere and possessing everything  fruitfulness was the invincible   sovereign conqueress  yet their conquest had not been meditated and  planned  ever serenely loyal in their dealings with others  they owed  it simply to the fulfilment of duty throughout their long years of toil   and they now stood before it hand in hand  like heroic figures  glorious  because they had ever been good and strong  because they had created  abundantly  because they had given abundance of joy  and health  and  hope to the world amid all the everlasting struggles and the everlasting  tears           xxiii    and mathieu and marianne lived more than a score of years longer  and  mathieu was ninety years old and marianne eighty seven  when their  three eldest sons  denis  ambroise  and gervais  ever erect beside them   planned that they would celebrate their diamond wedding  the seventieth  anniversary of their marriage  by a fete at which they would assemble  all the members of the family at chantebled     it was no little affair  when they had drawn up a complete list  they  found that one hundred and fifty eight children  grandchildren  and  great grandchildren had sprung from mathieu and marianne  without  counting a few little ones of a fourth generation  by adding to the  above those who had married into the family as husbands and wives they  would be three hundred in number  and where at the farm could they find  a room large enough for the huge table of the patriarchal feast that  they dreamt of  the anniversary fell on june    and the spring that year  was one of incomparable mildness and beauty  so they decided that they  would lunch out of doors  and place the tables in front of the old  pavilion  on the large lawn  enclosed by curtains of superb elms and  hornbeams  which gave the spot the aspect of a huge hall of verdure   there they would be at home  on the very breast of the beneficent earth   under the central and now gigantic oak  planted by the two ancestors   whose blessed fruitfulness the whole swarming progeny was about to  celebrate     thus the festival was settled and organized amid a great impulse of  love and joy  all were eager to take part in it  all hastened to the  triumphal gathering  from the white haired old men to the urchins who  still sucked their thumbs  and the broad blue sky and the flaming sun  were bent on participating in it also  as well as the whole estate  the  streaming springs and the fields in flower  giving promise of bounteous  harvests  magnificent looked the huge horseshoe table set out amid the  grass  with handsome china and snowy cloths which the sunbeams flecked  athwart the foliage  the august pair  the father and mother  were to  sit side by side  in the centre  under the oak tree  it was decided  also that the other couples should not be separated  that it would be  charming to place them side by side according to the generation they  belonged to  but as for the young folks  the youths and maidens  the  urchins and the little girls  they  it was thought  might well be left  to seat themselves as their fancy listed     early in the morning those bidden to the feast began to arrive in bands   the dispersed family returned to the common nest  swooping down upon it  from the four points of the compass  but alas  death s scythe had been  at work  and there were many who could not come  departed ones slept   each year more numerous  in the peaceful  flowery  janville cemetery   near rose and blaise  who had been the first to depart  others had gone  thither to sleep the eternal sleep  each time carrying away a little  more of the family s heart  and making of that sacred spot a place of  worship and eternal souvenir  first charlotte  after long illness  had  joined blaise  happy in leaving berthe to replace her beside mathieu and  marianne  who were heart stricken by her death  as if indeed they were  for the second time losing their dear son  afterwards their daughter  claire had likewise departed from them  leaving the farm to her husband  frederic and her brother gervais  who likewise had become a widower  during the ensuing year  then  too  mathieu and marianne had lost their  son gregoire  the master of the mill  whose widow therese still ruled  there amid a numerous progeny  and again they had to mourn another of  their daughters  the kind hearted marguerite  dr  chambouvet s wife   who sickened and died  through having sheltered a poor workman s little  children  who were affected with croup  and the other losses could no  longer be counted among them were some who had married into the family   wives and husbands  and there were in particular many children  the  tithe that death always exacts  those who are struck down by the storms  which sweep over the human crop  all the dear little ones for whom the  living weep  and who sanctify the ground in which they rest     but if the dear departed yonder slept in deepest silence  how gay was  the uproar and how great the victory of life that morning along the  roads which led to chantebled  the number of those who were born  surpassed that of those who died  from each that departed  a whole  florescence of living beings seemed to blossom forth  they sprang up in  dozens from the ground where their forerunners had laid themselves to  sleep when weary of their work  and they flocked to chantebled from  every side  even as swallows return at spring to revivify their old  nests  filling the blue sky with the joy of their return  outside the  farm  vehicles were ever setting down fresh families with troops  of children  whose sea of fair heads was always expanding   great grandfathers with snowy hair came leading little ones who could  scarcely toddle  there were very nice looking old ladies whom young  girls of dazzling freshness assisted to alight  there were mothers  expecting the arrival of other babes  and fathers to whom the charming  idea had occurred of inviting their daughters  affianced lovers  and  they were all related  they had all sprung from a common ancestry  they  were all mingled in an inextricable tangle  fathers  mothers   brothers  sisters  fathers in law  mothers in law  brothers in law   sisters in law  sons  daughters  uncles  aunts  and cousins  of every  possible degree  down to the fourth generation  and they were all one  family  one sole little nation  assembling in joy and pride to celebrate  that diamond wedding  the rare prodigious nuptials of two heroic  creatures whom life had glorified and from whom all had sprung  and what  an epic  what a biblical numbering of that people suggested itself  how  even name all those who entered the farm  how simply set forth their  names  their ages  their degree of relationship  the health  the  strength  and the hope that they had brought into the world     before everybody else there were those of the farm itself  all those who  had been born and who had grown up there  gervais  now sixty two  was  helped by his two eldest sons  leon and henri  who between them had ten  children  while his three daughters  mathilde  leontine  and julienne   who were married in the district  in like way numbered between them  twelve  then frederic  claire s husband  who was five years older than  gervais  had surrendered his post as a faithful lieutenant to his son  joseph  while his daughters angele and lucille  as well as a second son  jules  also helped on the farm  the four supplying a troop of fifteen  children  some of them boys and some girls     then  of all those who came from without  the mill claimed the first  place  therese  gregoire s widow  arrived with her offspring  her  son robert  who now managed the mill under her control  and her three  daughters  genevieve  aline  and natalie  followed by quite a train of  children  ten belonging to the daughters and four to robert  next came  louise  notary mazaud s wife  and madeleine  architect herbette s wife   followed by dr  chambouvet  who had lost his wife  the good marguerite   and here again were three valiant companies  in the first  four  daughters  of whom colette was the eldest  in the second  five sons with  hilary at the head of them  and in the third  a son and daughter only   sebastien and christine  the whole  however  forming quite an army  for  there were twenty of mathieu s great grandchildren in the rear     but paris arrived on the scene with denis and his wife marthe   who headed a grand cortege  denis  now nearly seventy  and a  great grandfather through his daughters hortense and marcelle  had  enjoyed the happy rest which follows accomplished labor ever since he  had handed his works over to his eldest sons lucien and paul  who were  both men of more than forty  and whose own sons were already on the road  to every sort of fortune  and what with the mother and father  the four  children  the fifteen grandchildren  and the three great grandchildren   two of whom were yet in swaddling clothes  this was really an invading  tribe packed into five vehicles     then the final entry was that of the little nation which had sprung from  ambroise  who to his great grief had early lost his wife andree  his was  such a green old age that at sixty seven he still directed his business   in which his sons leonce and charles remained simple  employes  like  his sons in law  the husbands of his daughters  pauline and sophie  who  trembled before him  uncontested king that he remained  obeyed by one  and all  grandfather of seven big bearded young men and nine strong  young women  through four of whom he had become a great grandfather  even before his elder  the wise denis  for this troop six carriages were  required  and the defile lasted two hours  and the farm was soon full of  a happy  laughing throng  holiday making in the bright june sunlight     mathieu and marianne had not yet put in an appearance  ambroise  who was  the grand master of the ceremonies that day  had made them promise to  remain in their room  like sovereigns hidden from their people  until  he should go to fetch them  he desired that they should appear in all  solemnity  and when he made up his mind to summon them  the whole nation  being assembled together  he found his brother benjamin on the threshold  of the house defending the door like a bodyguard     he  benjamin  had remained the one idler  the one unfruitful scion of  that swarming tribe  which had toiled and multiplied so prodigiously   now three and forty years of age  without a wife and without children   he lived  it seemed  solely for the joy of the old home  as a companion  to his father and a passionate worshipper of his mother  who with the  egotism of love had set themselves upon keeping him for themselves  alone  at first they had not been opposed to his marrying  but when  they had seen him refuse one match after another  they had secretly felt  great delight  nevertheless  as years rolled by  some unacknowledged  remorse had come to them amid their happiness at having him beside  them like some hoarded treasure  the delight of an avaricious old age   following a life of prodigality  did not their benjamin suffer at having  been thus monopolized  shut up for their sole pleasure within the  four walls of their house  he had at all times displayed an anxious  dreaminess  his eyes had ever sought far away things  the unknown land  where perfect satisfaction dwelt  yonder  behind the horizon  and now  that age was stealing upon him his torment seemed to increase  as if he  were in despair at finding himself unable to try the possibilities of  the unknown  before he ended a useless life devoid of happiness     however  benjamin moved away from the door  ambroise gave his orders   and mathieu and marianne appeared upon the verdant lawn in the sunlight   an acclamation  merry laughter  affectionate clapping of hands greeted  them  the gay excited throng  the whole swarming family cried aloud    long live the father  long live the mother  long life  long life to the  father and the mother      at ninety years of age mathieu was still very upright and slim  closely  buttoned in a black frock coat like a young bridegroom  over his bare  head fell a snowy fleece  for after long wearing his hair cut short he  had now in a final impulse of coquetry allowed it to grow  so that it  seemed liked the  renouveau  of an old but vigorous tree  age might have  withered and worn and wrinkled his face  but he still retained the eyes  of his young days  large lustrous eyes  at once smiling and pensive   which still bespoke a man of thought and action  one who was very  simple  very gay  and very good hearted  and marianne at eighty seven  years of age also held herself very upright in her light bridal gown   still strong and still showing some of the healthy beauty of other days   with hair white like mathieu s  and softened face  illumined as by a  last glow under her silky tresses  she resembled one of those sacred  marbles whose features time has ravined  without  however  being able to  efface from them the tranquil splendor of life  she seemed  indeed  like  some fruitful cybele  retaining all firmness of contour  and living  anew in the broad daylight with gentle good humor sparkling in her large  black eyes     arm in arm close to one another  like a worthy couple who had come from  afar  who had walked on side by side without ever parting for seventy  long years  mathieu and marianne smiled with tears of joy in their eyes  at the whole swarming family which had sprung from their love  and which  still acclaimed them      long live the father  long live the mother  long life  long life to the  father and the mother      then came the ceremony of reciting a compliment and offering a bouquet   a fair haired little girl named rose  five years of age  had been  intrusted with this duty  she had been chosen because she was the eldest  child of the fourth generation  she was the daughter of angeline  who  was the daughter of berthe  who was the daughter of charlotte  wife of  blaise  and when the two ancestors saw her approach them with her big  bouquet  their emotion increased  happy tears again gathered in their  eyes  and recollections faltered on their lips   oh  our little rose   our blaise  our charlotte      all the past revived before them  the name of rose had been given to the  child in memory of the other long mourned rose  who had been the first  to leave them  and who slept yonder in the little cemetery  there in his  turn had blaise been laid  and thither charlotte had followed them  then  berthe  blaise s daughter  who had married philippe havard  had given  birth to angeline  and  later  angeline  having married georges delmas   had given birth to rose  berthe and philippe havard  angeline and  georges delmas stood behind the child  and she represented one and all   the dead  the living  the whole flourishing line  its many griefs  its  many joys  all the valiant toil of creation  all the river of life  that it typified  for everything ended in her  dear  frail  fair haired  angel  with eyes bright like the dawn  in whose depths the future  sparkled      oh  our rose  our rose      with a big bouquet between her little hands rose had stepped forward   she had been learning a very fine compliment for a fortnight past  and  that very morning she had recited it to her mother without making a  single mistake  but when she found herself there among all these people  she could not recollect a word of it  still that did not trouble her   she was already a very bold little damsel  and she frankly dropped her  bouquet and sprang at the necks of mathieu and marianne  exclaiming in  her shrill  flute like voice   grandpapa  grandmamma  it s your fete   and i kiss you with all my heart      and that suited everybody remarkably well  they even found it far better  than any compliment  laughter and clapping of hands and acclamations  again arose  then they forthwith began to take their seats at table     this  however  was quite an affair  so large was the horse shoe table  spread out under the oak on the short  freshly cut grass  first mathieu  and marianne  still arm in arm  went ceremoniously to seat themselves  in the centre with their backs towards the trunk of the great tree  on  mathieu s left  marthe and denis  louise and her husband  notary mazaud   took their places  since it had been fittingly decided that the husbands  and wives should not be separated  on the right of marianne came  ambroise  therese  gervais  dr  chambouvet  three widowers and a widow   then another married couple  madeleine and her husband  architect  herbette  and then benjamin alone  the other married folks afterwards  installed themselves according to the generation they belonged to  and  then  as had been decided  youth and childhood  the whole troop of  young people and little ones took seats as they pleased amid no little  turbulence     what a moment of sovereign glory it was for mathieu and marianne  they  found themselves there in a triumph of which they would never have dared  to dream  life  as if to reward them for having shown faith in her   for having increased her sway with all bravery  seemed to have taken  pleasure in prolonging their existences beyond the usual limits so that  their eyes might behold the marvellous blossoming of their work  the  whole of their dear chantebled  everything good and beautiful that they  had there begotten and established  participated in the festival  from  the cultivated fields that they had set in the place of marshes came the  broad quiver of great coming harvests  from the pasture lands amid the  distant woods came the warm breath of cattle and innumerable flocks  which ever increased the ark of life  and they heard  too  the loud  babble of the captured springs with which they had fertilized the now  fruitful moorlands  the flow of that water which is like the very blood  of our mother earth  the social task was accomplished  bread was won   subsistence had been created  drawn from the nothingness of barren soil     and on what a lovely and well loved spot did their happy  grateful race  offer them that festival  those elms and hornbeams  which made the lawn  a great hall of greenery  had been planted by themselves  they had seen  them growing day by day like the most peaceable and most sturdy of their  children  and in particular that oak  now so gigantic  thanks to the  clear waters of the adjoining basin through which one of the sources  ever streamed  was their own big son  one that dated from the day when  they had founded chantebled  he  mathieu  digging the hole and she   marianne  holding the sapling erect  and now  as that tree stood there   shading them with its expanse of verdure  was it not like some royal  symbol of the whole family  like that oak the family had grown and  multiplied  ever throwing out fresh branches which spread far over  the ground  and like that oak it now formed by itself a perfect forest  sprung from a single trunk  vivified by the same sap  strong in the same  health  and full of song  and breeziness  and sunlight     leaning against that giant tree mathieu and marianne became merged in  its sovereign glory and majesty  and was not their royalty akin to  its own  had they not begotten as many beings as the tree had begotten  branches  did they not reign there over a nation of their children  who  lived by them  even as the leaves above lived by the tree  the three  hundred big and little ones seated around them were but a prolongation  of themselves  they belonged to the same tree of life  they had sprung  from their love and still clung to them by every fibre  mathieu and  marianne divined how joyous they all were at glorifying themselves in  making much of them  how moved the elder ones  how turbulently merry the  younger felt  they could hear their own hearts beating in the breasts of  the fair haired urchins who already laughed with ecstasy at the sight of  the cakes and pastry on the table  and their work of human creation was  assembled in front of them and within them  in the same way as the  oak s huge dome spread out above it  and all around they were likewise  encompassed by the fruitfulness of their other work  the fertility and  growth of nature which had increased even as they themselves multiplied     then was the true beauty which had its abode in mathieu and marianne  made manifest  that beauty of having loved one another for seventy years  and of still worshipping one another now even as on the first day  for  seventy years had they trod life s pathway side by side and arm in arm   without a quarrel  without ever a deed of unfaithfulness  they could  certainly recall great sorrows  but these had always come from without   and if they had sometimes sobbed they had consoled one another by  mingling their tears  under their white locks they had retained the  faith of their early days  their hearts remained blended  merged one  into the other  even as on the morrow of their marriage  each having  then been freely given and never taken back  in them the power of love   the will of action  the divine desire whose flame creates worlds  had  happily met and united  he  adoring his wife  had known no other  joy than the passion of creation  looking on the work that had to  be performed and the work that was accomplished as the sole why and  wherefore of his being  his duty and his reward  she  adoring her  husband  had simply striven to be a true companion  spouse  mother   and good counsellor  one who was endowed with delicacy of judgment and  helped to overcome all difficulties  between them they were reason   and health  and strength  if  too  they had always triumphed athwart  obstacles and tears  it was only by reason of their long agreement   their common fealty amid an eternal renewal of their love  whose  armor rendered them invincible  they could not be conquered  they had  conquered by the very power of their union without designing it  and  they ended heroically  as conquerors of happiness  hand in hand  pure  as crystal is  very great  very handsome  the more so from their extreme  age  their long  long life  which one love had entirely filled  and the  sole strength of their innumerable offspring now gathered there  the  conquering tribe that had sprung from their loins  was the strength of  union inherited from them  the loyal love transmitted from ancestors to  children  the mutual affection which impelled them to help one another  and ever fight for a better life in all brotherliness     but mirthful sounds arose  the banquet was at last being served  all the  servants of the farm had gathered to discharge this duty  they would not  allow a single person from without to help them  nearly all had grown up  on the estate  and belonged  as it were  to the family  by and by they  would have a table for themselves  and in their turn celebrate the  diamond wedding  and it was amid exclamations and merry laughter that  they brought the first dishes     all at once  however  the serving ceased  silence fell  an unexpected  incident attracted all attention  a young man  whom none apparently  could recognize  was stepping across the lawn  between the arms of the  horse shoe table  he smiled gayly as he walked on  only stopping when  he was face to face with mathieu and marianne  then in a loud voice  he said   good day  grandfather  good day  grandmother  you must have  another cover laid  for i have come to celebrate the day with you      the onlookers remained silent  in great astonishment  who was this young  man whom none had ever seen before  assuredly he could not belong to the  family  for they would have known his name  have recognized his face   why  then  did he address the ancestors by the venerated names of  grandfather and grandmother  and the stupefaction was the greater by  reason of his extraordinary resemblance to mathieu  assuredly  he was a  froment  he had the bright eyes and the lofty tower like forehead of  the race  mathieu lived again in him  such as he appeared in  a piously preserved portrait representing him at the age of  seven and twenty when he had begun the conquest of chantebled     mathieu  for his part  rose  trembling  while marianne smiled divinely   for she understood the truth before all the others      who are you  my child   asked mathieu   you  who call me grandfather   and who resemble me as if you were my brother       i am dominique  the eldest son of your son nicolas  who lives with my  mother  lisbeth  in the vast free country yonder  the other france       and how old are you       i shall be seven and twenty next august  when  yonder  the waters of  the niger  the good giant  come back to fertilize our spreading fields       and tell us  are you married  have you any children       i have taken for my wife a french woman  born in senegal  and in the  brick house which i have built  four children are already growing up  under the flaming sun of the soudan       and tell us also  have you any brothers  any sisters       my father  nicolas  and lisbeth  my mother  have had eighteen children   two of whom are dead  we are sixteen  nine boys and seven girls      at this mathieu laughed gayly  as if to say that his son nicolas at  fifty years of age had already proved a more valiant artisan of life  than himself      well then  my boy   he said   since you are the son of my son nicolas   come and embrace us to celebrate our wedding  and a cover shall be  placed for you  you are at home here      in four strides dominique made the round of the tables  then cast his  strong arms about the old people and embraced them  they the while  feeling faint with happy emotion  so delightful was that surprise  yet  another child falling among them  and on that day  as from some distant  sky  and telling them of the other family  the other nation which  had sprung from them  and which was swarming yonder with increase of  fruitfulness amid the fiery glow of the tropics     that surprise was due to the sly craft of ambroise  who merrily  explained how he had prepared it like a masterly coup de theatre  for  a week past he had been lodging and hiding dominique in his house in  paris  the young man having been sent from the soudan by his father to  negotiate certain business matters  and in particular to order of denis  a quantity of special agricultural machinery adapted to the soil of  that far away region  thus denis alone had been taken into the other s  confidence     when all those seated at the table saw dominique in the old people s  arms  and learnt the whole story  there came an extraordinary outburst  of delight  deafening acclamations arose once more  and what with their  enthusiastic greetings and embraces they almost stifled the messenger  from the sister family  that prince of the second dynasty of the  froments which ruled in the land of the future france     mathieu gayly gave his orders   there  place his cover in front of us   he alone will be in front of us like the ambassador of some powerful  empire  remember that  apart from his father and mother  he represents  nine brothers and seven sisters  without counting the four children that  he already has himself  there  my boy  sit down  and now let the service  continue      the feast proved a mirthful one under the big oak tree whose shade was  spangled by the sunbeams  delicious freshness arose from the grass   friendly nature seemed to contribute its share of caresses  the laughter  never ceased  old folks became playful children once more in presence of  the ninety and the eighty seven years of the bridegroom and the bride   faces beamed softly under white and dark and sunny hair  the whole  assembly was joyful  beautiful with a healthy rapturous beauty  the  children radiant  the youths superb  the maidens adorable  the married  folk united  side by side  and what good appetites there were  what a  gay tumult greeted the advent of each fresh dish  and how the good wine  was honored to celebrate the goodness of life which had granted the two  patriarchs the supreme grace of assembling them all at their table on  such a glorious occasion  at dessert came toasts and health drinking and  fresh acclamations  but  amid all the chatter which flew from one to  the other end of the table  the conversation invariably reverted to  the surprise at the outset  that triumphal entry of the brotherly  ambassador  it was he  his unexpected presence  all that he had not  yet said  all the adventurous romance which he surely personated  that  fanned the growing fever  the excitement of the family  intoxicated  by that open air gala  and as soon as the coffee was served no end of  questions arose on every side  and he had to speak out      well  what can i say   he replied  laughing  to a question put to him  by ambroise  who wished to know what he thought of chantebled  where  he had taken him for a stroll during the morning   i m afraid that if  i speak in all frankness  you won t think me very complimentary   cultivation  no doubt  is quite an art here  a splendid effort of will  and science and organization  as is needed to draw from this old soil  such crops as it can still produce  you toil a great deal  and you  effect prodigies  but  good heavens  how small your kingdom is  how can  you live here without hurting yourselves by ever rubbing against other  people s elbows  you are all heaped up to such a degree that you no  longer have the amount of air needful for a man s lungs  your largest  stretches of land  what you call your big estates  are mere clods of  soil where the few cattle that one sees look to me like lost ants  but  ah  the immensity of our niger  the immensity of the plains it waters   the immensity of our fields  whose only limit is the distant horizon      benjamin had listened  quivering  ever since that son of the great river  had arrived  he had continued gazing at him  with passion rising in his  dreamy eyes  and on hearing him speak in this fashion he could no longer  restrain himself  but rose  went round the table  and sat down beside  him      the niger  the immense plains  tell us all about them   he said      the niger  the good giant  the father of us all over yonder   responded  dominique   i was barely eight years old when my parents quitted  senegal  yielding to an impulse of reckless bravery and wild hope   possessed by a craving to plunge into the soudan and conquer as chance  might will it  there are many days  march among rocks and scrub and  rivers from st  louis to our present farm  far beyond djenny  and i no  longer remember the first journey  it seems to me as if i sprang from  good father niger himself  from the wondrous fertility of his waters   he is gentle but immense  rolling countless waves like the sea  and so  broad  so vast  that no bridge can span him as he flows from horizon to  horizon  he carries archipelagoes on his breast  and stretches out arms  covered with herbage like pasture land  and there are the depths where  flotillas of huge fishes roam at their ease  father niger has his  tempests  too  and his days of fire  when his waters beget life in the  burning clasp of the sun  and he has his delightful nights  his soft and  rosy nights  when peace descends on earth from the stars     he is the  ancestor  the founder  the fertilizer of the western soudan  which he  has dowered with incalculable wealth  wresting it from the invasion of  neighboring saharas  building it up of his own fertile ooze  it is he  who every year at regular seasons floods the valley like an ocean and  leaves it rich  pregnant  as it were  with amazing vegetation  even  like the nile  he has vanquished the sands  he is the father of untold  generations  the creative deity of a world as yet unknown  which in  later times will enrich old europe     and the valley of the niger  the  good giant s colossal daughter  ah  what pure immensity is hers  what  a flight  so to say  into the infinite  the plain opens and expands   unbroken and limitless  ever and ever comes the plain  fields are  succeeded by other fields stretching out of sight  whose end a plough  would only reach in months and months  all the food needed for a great  nation will be reaped there when cultivation is practised with a little  courage and a little science  for it is still a virgin kingdom such  as the good river created it  thousands of years ago  to morrow this  kingdom will belong to the workers who are bold enough to take it  each  carving for himself a domain as large as his strength of toil can dream  of  not an estate of acres  but leagues and leagues of ploughland wavy  with eternal crops     and what breadth of atmosphere there is in that  immensity  what delight it is to inhale all the air of that space at one  breath  and how healthy and strong the life  for one is no longer piled  one upon the other  but one feels free and powerful  master of that part  of the earth which one has desired under the sun which shines for all      benjamin listened and questioned  never satisfied   how are you  installed there   he asked   how do you live  what are your habits  what  is your work      dominique began to laugh again  conscious as he was that he was  astonishing  upsetting all these unknown relatives who pressed so close  to him  aglow with increasing curiosity  women and old men had in  turn left their places to draw near to him  even children had gathered  around  as if to listen to a fine story      oh  we live in republican fashion   said he   every member of our  community has to help in the common fraternal task  the family counts  more or less expert artisans of all kinds for the rough work  my father  in particular has revealed himself to be a very skilful mason  for  he had to build a place for us when we arrived  he even made his own  bricks  thanks to some deposits of clayey soil which exist near djenny   so our farm is now a little village  each married couple will have its  own house  then  too  we are not only agriculturists  we are fishermen  and hunters also  we have our boats  the niger abounds in fish to an  extraordinary degree  and there are wonderful hauls at times  and even  the shooting and hunting would suffice to feed us  game is plentiful   there are partridges and wild guinea fowl  not to mention the  flamingoes  the pelicans  the egrets  the thousands of creatures who  do not prey on one another  black lions visit us at times  eagles fly  slowly over our heads  at dusk hippopotami come in parties of three  and four to gambol in the river with the clumsy grace of negro children  bathing  but  after all  we are more particularly cultivators  kings  of the plain  especially when the waters of the niger withdraw after  fertilizing our fields  our estate has no limits  it stretches as far as  we can labor  and ah  if you could only see the natives  who do not even  plough  but have few if any appliances beyond sticks  with which they  just scratch the soil before confiding the seed to it  there is no  trouble  no worry  the earth is rich  the sun ardent  and thus the crop  will always be a fine one  when we ourselves employ the plough  when we  bestow a little care on the soil which teems with life  what prodigious  crops there are  an abundance of grain such as your barns could never  hold  as soon as we possess the agricultural machinery  which i have  come to order here in france  we shall need flotillas of boats in order  to send you the overplus of our granaries     when the river subsides   when its waters fall  the crop we more particularly grow is rice  there  are  indeed  plains of rice  which occasionally yield two crops  then  come millet and ground beans  and by and by will come corn  when we can  grow it on a large scale  vast cotton fields follow one after the other   and we also grow manioc and indigo  while in our kitchen gardens we have  onions and pimentoes  and gourds and cucumbers  and i don t mention the  natural vegetation  the precious gum trees  of which we possess quite a  forest  the butter trees  the flour trees  the silk trees  which grow  on our ground like briers alongside your roads     finally  we are  shepherds  we own ever increasing flocks  whose numbers we don t even  know  our goats  our bearded sheep may be counted by the thousand  our  horses scamper freely through paddocks as large as cities  and when  our hunch backed cattle come down to the niger to drink at that hour of  serene splendor the sunset  they cover a league of the river banks      and  above everything else  we are free men and joyous men  working for  the delight of living without restraint  and our reward is the thought  that our work is very great and good and beautiful  since it is the  creation of another france  the sovereign france of to morrow      from that moment dominique paused no more  there was no longer any need  to question him  he poured forth all the beauty and grandeur in his  mind  he spoke of djenny  the ancient queen city  whose people and  whose monuments came from egypt  the city which even yet reigns over  the valley  he spoke of four other centres  bamakoo  niamina  segu   and sansandig  big villages which would some day be great towns  and he  spoke particularly of timbuctoo the glorious  so long unknown  with a  veil of legends cast over it as if it were some forbidden paradise  with  its gold  its ivory  its beautiful women  all rising like a mirage of  inaccessible delight beyond the devouring sands  he spoke of timbuctoo   the gate of the sahara and the western soudan  the frontier town where  life ended and met and mingled  whither the camel of the desert  brought the weapons and merchandise of europe as well as salt  that  indispensable commodity  and where the pirogues of the niger landed the  precious ivory  the surface gold  the ostrich feathers  the gum  the  crops  all the wealth of the fruitful valley  he spoke of timbuctoo the  store place  the metropolis and market of central africa  with its  piles of ivory  its piles of virgin gold  its sacks of rice  millet   and ground nuts  its cakes of indigo  its tufts of ostrich plumes  its  metals  its dates  its stuffs  its iron ware  and particularly its slabs  of rock salt  brought on the backs of beasts of burden from taudeni  the  frightful saharian city of salt  whose soil is salt for leagues around   an infernal mine of that salt which is so precious in the soudan that it  serves as a medium of exchange  as money more precious even than gold   and finally  he spoke of timbuctoo impoverished  fallen from its high  estate  the opulent and resplendent city of former times now almost in  ruins  hiding remnants of its treasures behind cracked walls in fear of  the robbers of the desert  but withal apt to become once more a city  of glory and fortune  royally seated as it is between the soudan  that  granary of abundance  and the sahara  the road to europe  as soon as  france shall have opened that road  have connected the provinces of her  new empire  and have founded that huge new france of which the ancient  fatherland will be but the directing mind      that is the dream   cried dominique   that is the gigantic work which  the future will achieve  algeria  connected with timbuctoo by the sahara  railway line  over which electric engines will carry the whole of old  europe through the far expanse of sand  timbuctoo connected with senegal  by flotillas of steam vessels and yet other railways  all intersecting  the vast empire on every side  new france connected with mother france   the old land  by a wondrous development of the means of communication   and founded  and got ready for the hundred millions of inhabitants who  will some day spring up there     doubtless these things cannot be done  in a night  the trans saharian railway is not yet laid down  there are  two thousand five hundred kilometres  of bare desert to be crossed which  can hardly tempt railway companies  and a certain amount of prosperity  must be developed by starting cultivation  seeking and working mines   and increasing exportations before a pecuniary effort can be possible  on the part of the motherland  moreover  there is the question of the  natives  mostly of gentle race  though some are ferocious bandits   whose savagery is increased by religious fanaticism  thus rendering the  difficulties of our conquest all the greater  until the terrible problem  of islamism is solved we shall always be coming in conflict with it  and  only life  long years of life  can create a new nation  adapt it to the  new land  blend diverse elements together  and yield normal existence   homogeneous strength  and genius proper to the clime  but no matter   from this day a new france is born yonder  a huge empire  and it needs  our blood  and some must be given it  in order that it may be peopled  and be able to draw its incalculable wealth from the soil  and become  the greatest  the strongest  and the mightiest in the world          about       english miles     transported with enthusiasm  quivering at the thought of the distant  ideal at last revealed to him  benjamin sat there with tears in his  eyes  ah  the healthy life  the noble life  the other life  the whole  mission and work of which he had as yet but confusedly dreamt  again he  asked a question   and are there many french families there  colonizing  like yours      dominique burst into a loud laugh   oh  no   said he   there are  certainly a few colonists in our old possessions of senegal  but yonder  in the niger valley  beyond djenny  there are  i think  only ourselves   we are the pioneers  the vanguard  the riskers full of faith and hope   and there is some merit in it  for to sensible stay at home folks it  all seems like defying common sense  can you picture it  a french family  installed among savages  and unprotected  save for the vicinity of a  little fort  where a french officer commands a dozen native soldiers  a  french family  which is sometimes called upon to fight in person  and  which establishes a farm in a land where the fanaticism of some head  tribesman may any day stir up trouble  it seems so insane that folks  get angry at the mere thought of it  yet it enraptures us and gives us  gayety and health  and the courage to achieve victory  we are opening  the road  we are giving the example  we are carrying our dear old france  yonder  taking to ourselves a huge expanse of virgin land  which will  become a province  we have already founded a village which in a hundred  years will be a great town  in the colonies no race is more fruitful  than the french  though it seems to become barren on its own ancient  soil  thus we shall swarm and swarm  and fill the world  so come then   come then  all of you  since here you are set too closely  since you  lack air in your little fields and your overheated  pestilence breeding  towns  there is room for everybody yonder  there are new lands  there is  open air that none has breathed  and there is a task to be accomplished  which will make all of you heroes  strong  sturdy men  well pleased to  live  come with me  i will take the men  i will take all the women who  are willing  and you will carve for yourselves other provinces and found  other cities for the future glory and power of the great new france      he laughed so gayly  he was so handsome  so spirited  so robust  that  once again the whole table acclaimed him  they would certainly not  follow him yonder  for all those married couples already had their own  nests  and all those young folks were already too strongly rooted to the  old land by the ties of their race  a race which after displaying such  adventurous instincts has now fallen asleep  as it were  at its own  fireside  but what a marvellous story it all was  a story to which big  and little alike  had listened in rapture  and which to morrow would   doubtless  arouse within them a passion for glorious enterprise far  away  the seed of the unknown was sown  and would grow into a crop of  fabulous magnitude     for the moment benjamin was the only one who cried amid the enthusiasm  which drowned his words   yes  yes  i want to live  take me  take me  with you      but dominique resumed  by way of conclusion   and there is one thing   grandfather  which i have not yet told you  my father has given the name  of chantebled to our farm yonder  he often tells us how you founded your  estate here  in an impulse of far seeing audacity  although everybody  jeered and shrugged their shoulders and declared that you must be mad   and  yonder  my father has to put up with the same derision  the same  contemptuous pity  for people declare that the good niger will some day  sweep away our village  even if a band of prowling natives does not kill  and eat us  but i m easy in mind about all that  we shall conquer as  you conquered  for what seems to be the folly of action is really divine  wisdom  there will be another kingdom of the froments yonder  another  huge chantebled  of which you and my grandmother will be the ancestors   the distant patriarchs  worshipped like deities     and i drink to your  health  grandfather  and i drink to yours  grandmother  on behalf of  your other future people  who will grow up full of spirit under the  burning sun of the tropics      then with great emotion mathieu  who had risen  replied in a powerful  voice   to your health  my boy  to the health of my son nicolas  his  wife  lisbeth  and all who have been born from them  and to the health  of all who will follow  from generation to generation      and marianne  who had likewise risen  in her turn said   to the health  of your wives  and your daughters  your spouses and your mothers  to the  health of those who will love and produce the greatest sum of life  in  order that the greatest possible sum of happiness may follow      then  the banquet ended  they quitted the table and spread freely over  the lawn  there was a last ovation around mathieu and marianne  who were  encompassed by their eager offspring  at one and the same time a score  of arms were outstretched  carrying children  whose fair or dark heads  they were asked to kiss  aged as they were  returning to a divine  state of childhood  they did not always recognize those little lads and  lasses  they made mistakes  used wrong names  fancied that one child  was another  laughter thereupon arose  the mistakes were rectified  and  appeals were made to the old people s memory  they likewise laughed  the  errors were amusing  but it mattered little if they no longer remembered  a name  the child at any rate belonged to the harvest that had sprung  from them     then there were certain granddaughters and great granddaughters whom  they themselves summoned and kissed by way of bringing good luck to the  babes that were expected  the children of their children s children   the race which would ever spread and perpetuate them through the far off  ages  and there were mothers  also  who were nursing  mothers whose  little ones  after sleeping quietly during the feast  had now awakened   shrieking their hunger aloud  these had to be fed  and the mothers  merrily seated themselves together under the trees and gave them the  breast in all serenity  therein lay the royal beauty of woman  wife and  mother  fruitful maternity triumphed over virginity by which life is  slain  ah  might manners and customs change  might the idea of morality  and the idea of beauty be altered  and the world recast  based on the  triumphant beauty of the mother suckling her babe in all the majesty of  her symbolism  from fresh sowings there ever came fresh harvests  the  sun ever rose anew above the horizon  and milk streamed forth endlessly  like the eternal sap of living humanity  and that river of milk carried  life through the veins of the world  and expanded and overflowed for the  centuries of the future     the greatest possible sum of life in order that the greatest possible  happiness might result  that was the act of faith in life  the act of  hope in the justice and goodness of life s work  victorious fruitfulness  remained the one true force  the sovereign power which alone moulded  the future  she was the great revolutionary  the incessant artisan of  progress  the mother of every civilization  ever re creating her army  of innumerable fighters  throwing through the centuries millions after  millions of poor and hungry and rebellious beings into the fight for  truth and justice  not a single forward step in history has ever been  taken without numerousness having urged humanity forward  to morrow   like yesterday  will be won by the swarming of the multitude whose quest  is happiness  and to morrow will give the benefits which our age has  awaited  economic equality obtained even as political equality has been  obtained  a just apportionment of wealth rendered easy  and compulsory  work re established as the one glorious and essential need     it is not true that labor has been imposed on mankind as punishment  for sin  it is on the contrary an honor  a mark of nobility  the most  precious of boons  the joy  the health  the strength  the very soul of  the world  which itself labors incessantly  ever creating the future   and misery  the great  abominable social crime  will disappear amid the  glorification of labor  the distribution of the universal task among one  and all  each accepting his legitimate share of duties and rights  and  may children come  they will simply be instruments of wealth  they will  but increase the human capital  the free happiness of a life in which  the children of some will no longer be beasts of burden  or food for  slaughter or for vice  to serve the egotism of the children of others   and life will then again prove the conqueror  there will come the  renascence of life  honored and worshipped  the religion of life so long  crushed beneath the hateful nightmare of roman catholicism  from which  on divers occasions the nations have sought to free themselves by  violence  and which they will drive away at last on the now near  day when cult and power  and sovereign beauty shall be vested in the  fruitful earth and the fruitful spouse     in that last resplendent hour of eventide  mathieu and marianne reigned  by virtue of their numerous race  they ended as heroes of life  because  of the great creative work which they had accomplished amid battle and  toil and grief  often had they sobbed  but with extreme old age had come  peace  deep smiling peace  made up of the good labor performed and the  certainty of approaching rest while their children and their children s  children resumed the fight  labored and suffered  lived in their own  turn  and a part of mathieu and marianne s heroic grandeur sprang from  the divine desire with which they had glowed  the desire which moulds  and regulates the world  they were like a sacred temple in which the  god had fixed his abode  they were animated by the inextinguishable fire  with which the universe ever burns for the work of continual creation   their radiant beauty under their white hair came from the light which  yet filled their eyes  the light of love s power  which age had been  unable to extinguish  doubtless  as they themselves jestingly remarked  at times  they had been prodigals  their family had been such a large  one  but  after all  had they not been right  their children had  diminished no other s share  each had come with his or her own means  of subsistence  and  besides   tis good to garner in excess when the  granaries of a country are empty  many such improvidents are needed  to combat the egotism of others at times of great dearth  amid all the  frightful loss and wastage  the race is strengthened  the country is  made afresh  a good civic example is given by such healthy prodigality  as mathieu and marianne had shown     but a last act of heroism was required of them  a month after the  festival  when dominique was on the point of returning to the soudan   benjamin one evening told them of his passion  of the irresistible  summons from the unknown distant plains  which he could but obey      dear father  darling mother  let me go with dominique  i have  struggled  i feel horrified with myself at quitting you thus  at your  great age  but i suffer too dreadfully  my soul is full of yearnings   and seems ready to burst  and i shall die of shameful sloth  if i do not  go      they listened with breaking hearts  their son s words did not surprise  them  they had heard them coming ever since their diamond wedding  and  they trembled  and felt that they could not refuse  for they knew that  they were guilty in having kept their last born in the family nest after  surrendering to life all the others  ah  how insatiable life was  it  would not so much as suffer that tardy avarice of theirs  it demanded  even the precious  discreetly hidden treasure from which  with jealous  egotism  they had dreamt of parting only when they might find themselves  upon the threshold of the grave     deep silence reigned  but at last mathieu slowly answered   i cannot  keep you back  my son  go whither life calls you     if i knew  however   that i should die to night  i would ask you to wait till to morrow      in her turn marianne gently said   why cannot we die at once  we should  then escape this last great pang  and you would only carry our memory  away with you      once again did the cemetery of janville appear  the field of peace   where dear ones already slept  and where they would soon join them  no  sadness tinged that thought  however  they hoped that they would lie  down there together on the same day  for they could not imagine life   one without the other  and  besides  would they not forever live in  their children  forever be united  immortal  in their race      dear father  darling mother   benjamin repeated   it is i who will be  dead to morrow if i do not go  to wait for your death  good god  would  not that be to desire it  you must still live long years  and i wish to  live like you      there came another pause  then mathieu and marianne replied together    go then  my boy  you are right  one must live      but on the day of farewell  what a wrench  what a final pang there was  when they had to tear themselves from that flesh of their flesh  all  that remained to them  in order to hand over to life the supreme gift  it demanded  the departure of nicolas seemed to begin afresh  again  came the  never more  of the migratory child taking wing  given to the  passing wind for the sowing of unknown distant lands  far beyond the  frontiers      never more   cried mathieu in tears     and marianne repeated in a great sob which rose from the very depths of  her being   never more  never more      there was now no longer any mere question of increasing a family  of  building up the country afresh  of re peopling france for the struggles  of the future  the question was one of the expansion of humanity  of the  reclaiming of deserts  of the peopling of the entire earth  after one s  country came the earth  after one s family  one s nation  and then  mankind  and what an invading flight  what a sudden outlook upon the  world s immensity  all the freshness of the oceans  all the perfumes  of virgin continents  blended in a mighty gust like a breeze from the  offing  scarcely fifteen hundred million souls are to day scattered  through the few cultivated patches of the globe  and is that not indeed  paltry  when the globe  ploughed from end to end  might nourish ten  times that number  what narrowness of mind there is in seeking to limit  mankind to its present figure  in admitting simply the continuance of  exchanges among nations  and of capitals dying where they stand  as  babylon  nineveh  and memphis died  while other queens of the earth  arise  inherit  and flourish amid fresh forms of civilization  and this  without population ever more increasing  such a theory is deadly  for  nothing remains stationary  whatever ceases to increase decreases and  disappears  life is the rising tide whose waves daily continue the work  of creation  and perfect the work of awaited happiness  which shall come  when the times are accomplished  the flux and reflux of nations are but  periods of the forward march  the great centuries of light  which dark  ages at times replace  simply mark the phases of that march  another  step forward is ever taken  a little more of the earth is conquered  a  little more life is brought into play  the law seems to lie in a  double phenomenon  fruitfulness creating civilization  and civilization  restraining fruitfulness  and equilibrium will come from it all on the  day when the earth  being entirely inhabited  cleared  and utilized   shall at last have accomplished its destiny  and the divine dream  the  generous utopian thought soars into the heavens  families blended into  nations  nations blended into mankind  one sole brotherly people making  of the world one sole city of peace and truth and justice  ah  may  eternal fruitfulness ever expand  may the seed of humanity be carried  over the frontiers  peopling the untilled deserts afar  and increasing  mankind through the coming centuries until dawns the reign of sovereign  life  mistress at last both of time and of space     and after the departure of benjamin  whom dominique took with him   mathieu and marianne recovered the joyful serenity and peace born of the  work which they had so prodigally accomplished  nothing more was theirs   nothing save the happiness of having given all to life  the  never  more  of separation became the  still more  of life  life incessantly  increasing  expanding beyond the limitless horizon  candid and  smiling  those all but centenarian heroes triumphed in the overflowing  florescence of their race  the milk had streamed even athwart the  seas  from the old land of france to the immensity of virgin africa  the  young and giant france of to morrow  after the foundation of chantebled   on a disdained  neglected spot of the national patrimony  another  chantebled was rising and becoming a kingdom in the vast deserted  tracts which life yet had to fertilize  and this was the exodus  human  expansion throughout the world  mankind upon the march towards the  infinite       england   august      may
