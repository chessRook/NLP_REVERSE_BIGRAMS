not discover what her determination had been  and  fearfully enquired his doom with hardly any hope of finding favour     but cecilia was above affectation  and a stranger to art   i would not   sir   she said   keep you an instant in suspense  when i am no longer in  suspense myself  i may have appeared trifling  but i have been nothing  less  and you would readily exculpate me of caprice  if half the  distress of my irresolution was known to you  even now  when i hesitate  no more  my mind is so ill at ease  that i could neither wonder nor be  displeased should you hesitate in your turn       you hesitate no more   cried he  almost breathless at the sound of  those words   and is it possible  oh my cecilia   is it possible your  resolution is in my favour       alas   cried she   how little is your reason to rejoice  a dejected and  melancholy gift is all you can receive       ere i take it  then   cried he  in a voice that spoke joy  pain  and  fear all at once in commotion   tell me if your reluctance has its  origin in  me   that i may rather even yet relinquish you  than merely  owe your hand to the selfishness of persecution       your pride   said she  half smiling   has some right to be alarmed   though i meant not to alarm it  no  it is with myself only i am at  variance  with my own weakness and want of judgment that i quarrel   in   you  i have all the reliance that the highest opinion of your honour  and integrity can give me      this was enough for the warm heart of delvile  not only to restore  peace  but to awaken rapture  he was almost as wild with delight  as he  had before been with apprehension  and poured forth his acknowledgments  with so much fervour of gratitude  that cecilia imperceptibly grew  reconciled to herself  and before she missed her dejection  participated  in his contentment     she quitted him as soon as she had power  to acquaint mrs charlton with  what had passed  and assist in preparing her to accompany them to the  altar  while delvile flew to his new acquaintance  mr singleton  the  lawyer  to request him to supply the place of mr monckton in giving her  away     all was now hastened with the utmost expedition  and to avoid  observation  they agreed to meet at the church  their desire of secrecy   however potent  never urging them to wish the ceremony should be  performed in a place less awful     when the chairs  however  came  which were to carry the two ladies  thither  cecilia trembled and hung back  the greatness of her  undertaking  the hazard of all her future happiness  the disgraceful  secrecy of her conduct  the expected reproaches of mrs delvile  and  the boldness and indelicacy of the step she was about to take  all so  forcibly struck  and so painfully wounded her  that the moment she was  summoned to set out  she again lost her resolution  and regretting the  hour that ever delvile was known to her  she sunk into a chair  and gave  up her whole soul to anguish and sorrow     the good mrs charlton tried in vain to console her  a sudden horror  against herself had now seized her spirits  which  exhausted by long  struggles  could rally no more     in this situation she was at length surprised by delvile  whose uneasy  astonishment that she had failed in her appointment  was only to be  equalled by that with which he was struck at the sight of her tears  he  demanded the cause with the utmost tenderness and apprehension  cecilia  for some time could not speak  and then  with a deep sigh   ah   she  cried   mr delvile  how weak are we all when unsupported by our own  esteem  how feeble  how inconsistent  how changeable  when our courage  has any foundation but duty      delvile  much relieved by finding her sadness sprung not from any new  affliction  gently reproached her breach of promise  and earnestly  entreated her to repair it   the clergyman   cried he   is waiting  i  have left him with mr singleton in the vestry  no new objections have  started  and no new obstacles have intervened  why  then  torment  ourselves with discussing again the old ones  which we have already  considered till every possible argument upon them is exhausted   tranquillize  i conjure you  your agitated spirits  and if the truest  tenderness  the most animated esteem  and the gratefullest admiration   can soften your future cares  and ensure your future peace  every  anniversary of this day will recompense my cecilia for every pang she  now suffers      cecilia  half soothed and half ashamed  finding she had in fact nothing  new to say or to object  compelled herself to rise  and  penetrated  by his solicitations  endeavoured to compose her mind  and promised to  follow him     he would not trust her  however  from his sight  but seizing the very  instant of her renewed consent  he dismissed the chairs  and ordering  a hackney coach  preferred any risk to that of her again wavering  and  insisted upon accompanying her in it himself     cecilia had now scarce time to breathe  before she found herself at the  porch of    church  delvile hurried her out of the carriage  and then  offered his arm to mrs charlton  not a word was spoken by any of the  party till they went into the vestry  where delvile ordered cecilia  a glass of water  and having hastily made his compliments to the  clergyman  gave her hand to mr singleton  who led her to the altar     the ceremony was now begun  and cecilia  finding herself past all power  of retracting  soon called her thoughts from wishing it  and turned her  whole attention to the awful service  to which though she listened with  reverence  her full satisfaction in the object of her vows  made  her listen without terror  but when the priest came to that solemn  adjuration   if any man can shew any just cause why they may not  lawfully be joined together   a conscious tear stole into her eye  and  a sigh escaped from delvile that went to her heart  but  when the priest  concluded the exhortation with  let him now speak  or else hereafter  for ever hold his peace   a female voice at some distance  called out in  shrill accents   i do      the ceremony was instantly stopt  the astonished priest immediately shut  up the book to regard the intended bride and bridegroom  delvile started  with amazement to see whence the sound proceeded  and cecilia  aghast   and struck with horror  faintly shriekt  and caught hold of mrs  charlton     the consternation was general  and general was the silence  though all  of one accord turned round towards the place whence the voice issued  a  female form at the same moment was seen rushing from a pew  who glided  out of the church with the quickness of lightning     not a word was yet uttered  every one seeming rooted to the spot on  which he stood  and regarding in mute wonder the place this form had  crossed     delvile at length exclaimed   what can this mean       did you not know the woman  sir   said the clergyman      no  sir  i did not even see her       nor you  madam   said he  addressing cecilia      no  sir   she answered  in a voice that scarce articulated the two  syllables  and changing colour so frequently  that delvile  apprehensive  she would faint  flew to her  calling out   let  me  support you      she turned from him hastily  and still  holding by mrs charlton  moved  away from the altar      whither   cried delvile  fearfully following her   whither are you  going      she made not any answer  but still  though tottering as much from  emotion as mrs charlton from infirmity  she walked on      why did you stop the ceremony  sir   cried delvile  impatiently  speaking to the clergyman      no ceremony  sir   he returned   could proceed with such an  interruption       it has been wholly accidental   cried he   for we neither of us  know the woman  who could not have any right or authority for the  prohibition   then yet more anxiously pursuing cecilia   why    he continued   do you thus move off   why leave the ceremony  unfinished   mrs charlton  what is it you are about   cecilia  i beseech  you return  and let the service go on      cecilia  making a motion with her hand to forbid his following her   still silently proceeded  though drawing along with equal difficulty mrs  charlton and herself      this is insupportable   cried delvile  with vehemence   turn  i conjure  you   my cecilia   my wife   why is it you thus abandon me   turn   i implore you  and receive my eternal vows   mrs charlton  bring her  back   cecilia  you  must  not go        he now attempted to take her hand  but shrinking from his touch  in an  emphatic but low voice  she said   yes  sir  i must   an interdiction  such as this   for the world could i not brave it      she then made an effort to somewhat quicken her pace      where   cried delvile  half frantic   where is this infamous woman   this wretch who has thus wantonly destroyed me      and he rushed out of the church in pursuit of her     the clergyman and mr singleton  who had hitherto been wondering  spectators  came now to offer their assistance to cecilia  she declined  any help for herself  but gladly accepted their services for mrs  charlton  who  thunderstruck by all that had past  seemed almost robbed  of her faculties  mr singleton proposed calling a hackney coach  she  consented  and they stopt for it at the church porch     the clergyman now began to enquire of the pew opener  what she knew of  the woman  who she was  and how she had got into the church  she knew of  her  she answered  nothing  but that she had come in to early prayers   and she supposed she had hid herself in a pew when they were over  as  she had thought the church entirely empty     an hackney coach now drew up  and while the gentlemen were assisting mrs  charlton into it  delvile returned      i have pursued and enquired   cried he   in vain  i can neither  discover nor hear of her   but what is all this  whither are you  going   what does this coach do here   mrs charlton  why do you get into  it   cecilia  what are you doing      cecilia turned away from him in silence  the shock she had received   took from her all power of speech  while amazement and terror deprived  her even of relief from tears  she believed delvile to blame  though she  knew not in what  but the obscurity of her fears served only to render  them more dreadful     she was now getting into the coach herself  but delvile  who could  neither brook her displeasure  nor endure her departure  forcibly caught  her hand  and called out   you are  mine   you are my  wife    i will  part with you no more  and go whithersoever you will  i will follow and  claim you       stop me not   cried she  impatiently though faintly   i am sick  i am  ill already   if you detain me any longer  i shall be unable to support  myself       oh then rest on  me    cried he  still holding her   rest but upon me  till the ceremony is over   you will drive me to despair and to madness  if you leave me in this barbarous manner      a crowd now began to gather  and the words bride and bridegroom reached  the ears of cecilia  who half dead with shame  with fear  and with  distress  hastily said  you are determined to make me miserable   and  snatching away her hand  which delvile at those words could no longer  hold  she threw herself into the carriage     delvile  however  jumped in after her  and with an air of authority  ordered the coachman to pall mall  and then drew up the glasses  with a  look of fierceness at the mob     cecilia had neither spirits nor power to resist him  yet  offended by  his violence  and shocked to be thus publickly pursued by him  her looks  spoke a resentment far more mortifying than any verbal reproach      inhuman cecilia   cried he  passionately   to desert me at the very  altar   to cast me off at the instant the most sacred rites were uniting  us   and then thus to look at me   to treat me with this disdain at a  time of such distraction   to scorn me thus injuriously at the moment  you unjustly abandon me       to how dreadful a scene   said cecilia  recovering from her  consternation   have you exposed me  to what shame  what indignity  what  irreparable disgrace       oh heaven   cried he with horror   if any crime  any offence of mine  has occasioned this fatal blow  the whole world holds not a wretch so  culpable as myself  nor one who will sooner allow the justice of your  rigour  my veneration for you has ever equalled my affection  and could  i think it was through  me  you have suffered any indignity  i should  soon abhor myself  as you seem to abhor me  but what is it i have done   how have i thus incensed you  by what action  by what guilt  have i  incurred this displeasure      whence   cried she   came that voice which still vibrates in my ear   the prohibition could not be on  my  account  since none to whom i am  known have either right or interest in even wishing it       what an inference is this  over  me   then  do you conclude this woman  had any power      here they stopt at the lodgings  delvile handed both the ladies out   cecilia  eager to avoid his importunities  and dreadfully disturbed   hastily past him  and ran up stairs  but mrs charlton refused not his  arm  on which she lent till they reached the drawing room     cecilia then rang the bell for her servant  and gave orders that a  post chaise might be sent for immediately     delvile now felt offended in his turn  but suppressing his vehemence  he  gravely and quietly said  determined as you are to leave me  indifferent  to my peace  and incredulous of my word  deign  at least  before we  part  to be more explicit in your accusation  and tell me if indeed it  is possible you can suspect that the wretch who broke off the ceremony   had ever from me received provocation for such an action       i know not what to suspect   said cecilia   where every thing is thus  involved in obscurity  but i must own i should have some difficulty to  think those words the effect of chance  or to credit that their speaker  was concealed without design       you are right  then  madam   cried he  resentfully   to discard me  to  treat me with contempt  to banish me without repugnance  since i see  you believe me capable of duplicity  and imagine i am better informed  in this affair than i appear to be  you have said i shall make you  miserable   no  madam  no  your happiness and misery depend not upon one  you hold so worthless       on whatever they depend   said cecilia   i am too little at ease for  discussion  i would no more be daring than superstitious  but none of  our proceedings have prospered  and since their privacy has always been  contrary both to my judgment and my principles  i know not how to repine  at a failure i cannot think unmerited  mrs charlton  our chaise is  coming  you will be ready  i hope  to set off in it directly      delvile  too angry to trust himself to speak  now walked about the room   and endeavoured to calm himself  but so little was his success  that  though silent till the chaise was announced  when he heard that dreaded  sound  and saw cecilia steady in her purpose of departing  he was so  much shocked and afflicted  that  clasping his hands in a transport of  passion and grief  he exclaimed   this  then  cecilia  is your faith   this is the felicity you bid me hope  this is the recompense of my  sufferings  and the performing of your engagement      cecilia  struck by these reproaches  turned back  but while she  hesitated how to answer them  he went on   you are insensible to my  misery  and impenetrable to my entreaties  a secret enemy has had power  to make me odious in your sight  though for her enmity i can assign no  cause  though even her existence was this morning unknown to me   ever ready to abandon  and most willing to condemn me  you have more  confidence in a vague conjecture  than in all you have observed of the  whole tenour of my character  without knowing why  you are disposed to  believe me criminal  without deigning to say wherefore  you are eager  to banish me your presence  yet scarce could a consciousness of guilt  itself  wound me so forcibly  so keenly  as your suspecting i am  guilty       again  then   cried cecilia   shall i subject myself to a scene of such  disgrace and horror  no  never   the punishment of my error shall at  least secure its reformation  yet if i merit your reproaches  i deserve  not your regard  cease  therefore  to profess any for me  or make them  no more       shew but to them   cried he   the smallest sensibility  shew but for  me the most distant concern  and i will try to bear my disappointment  without murmuring  and submit to your decrees as to those from which  there is no appeal  but to wound without deigning even to look at what  you destroy   to shoot at random those arrows that are pointed with  poison   to see them fasten on the heart  and corrode its vital  functions  yet look on without compunction  or turn away with cold  disdain   oh where is the candour i thought lodged in cecilia  where the  justice  the equity  i believed a part of herself       after all that has past   said cecilia  sensibly touched by his  distress   i expected not these complaints  nor that  from me  any  assurances would be wanted  yet  if it will quiet your mind  if it will  better reconcile you to our separation         oh fatal prelude   interrupted he   what on earth can quiet my mind  that leads to our separation   give to me no condescension with any such  view   preserve your indifference  persevere in your coldness   triumph still in your power of inspiring those feelings you can never  return   all  every thing is more supportable than to talk of our  separation       yet how   cried she   parted  torn asunder as we have been  how is it  now to be avoided       trust in my honour  shew me but the confidence which i will venture to  say i deserve  and then will that union no longer be impeded  which in  future  i am certain  will never be repented       good heaven  what a request  faith so implicit would be frenzy       you doubt  then  my integrity  you suspect         indeed i do not  yet in a case of such importance  what ought to guide  me but my own reason  my own conscience  my own sense of right  pain me  not  therefore  with reproaches  distress me no more with entreaties   when i solemnly declare that no earthly consideration shall ever  again make me promise you my hand  while the terror of mrs delvile s  displeasure has possession of my heart  and now adieu       you give me  then  up       be patient  i beseech you  and attempt not to follow me   tis a step i  cannot permit       not follow you  and who has power to prevent me        i  have  sir  if to incur my endless resentment is of any consequence  to you      she then  with an air of determined steadiness  moved on  mrs charlton   assisted by the servants  being already upon the stairs      o tyranny   cried he   what submission is it you exact   may i not even  enquire into the dreadful mystery of this morning       yes  certainly       and may i not acquaint you with it  should it be discovered       i shall not be sorry to hear it  adieu      she was now half way down the stairs  when  losing all forbearance  he  hastily flew after her  and endeavouring to stop her  called out   if  you do not hate and detest me   if i am not loathsome and abhorrent to  you  o quit me not thus insensibly   cecilia  my beloved cecilia   speak  to me  at least  one word of less severity  look at me once more  and  tell me we part not for ever      cecilia then turned round  and while a starting tear shewed her  sympathetic distress  said   why will you thus oppress me with  entreaties i ought not to gratify   have i not accompanied you to the  altar   and can you doubt what i have thought of you        have  thought   oh cecilia   is it then all over       pray suffer me to go quietly  and fear not i shall go too happily   suppress your own feelings  rather than seek to awaken mine  alas  there  is little occasion   oh mr delvile  were our connection opposed by no  duty  and repugnant to no friends  were it attended by no impropriety   and carried on with no necessity of disguise   you would not thus charge  me with indifference  you would not suspect me of insensibility   oh no   the choice of my heart would then be its glory  and all i now blush to  feel  i should openly and with pride acknowledge      she then hurried to the chaise  delvile pursuing her with thanks and  blessings  and gratefully assuring her  as he handed her into it  that  he would obey all her injunctions  and not even attempt to see her   till he could bring her some intelligence concerning the morning s  transaction     the chaise then drove off         chapter iii     a consternation     the journey was melancholy and tedious  mrs charlton  extremely fatigued  by the unusual hurry and exercise both of mind and body which she had  lately gone through  was obliged to travel very slowly  and to lie upon  the road  cecilia  however  was in no haste to proceed  she was going to  no one she wished to see  she was wholly without expectation of meeting  with any thing that could give her pleasure  the unfortunate expedition  in which she had been engaged  left her now nothing but regret  and only  promised her in future sorrow and mortification     mrs charlton  after her return home  still continued ill  and cecilia   who constantly attended her  had the additional affliction of imputing  her indisposition to herself  every thing she thought conspired to  punish the error she had committed  her proceedings were discovered   though her motives were unknown  the delvile family could not fail to  hear of her enterprize  and while they attributed it to her temerity   they would exult in its failure  but chiefly hung upon her mind the  unaccountable prohibition of her marriage  whence that could proceed  she was wholly without ability to divine  yet her surmizes were not more  fruitless than various  at one moment she imagined it some frolic of  morrice  at another some perfidy of monckton  and at another an idle  and unmeaning trick of some stranger to them all  but none of these  suppositions carried with them any air of probability  morrice  even if  he had watched their motions and pursued them to the church  which his  inquisitive impertinence made by no means impossible  could yet hardly  have either time or opportunity to engage any woman in so extraordinary  an undertaking  mr monckton  however averse to the connection  she  considered as a man of too much honour to break it off in a manner so  alarming and disgraceful  and mischief so wanton in any stranger  seemed  to require a share of unfeeling effrontery  which could fall to the lot  of so few as to make this suggestion unnatural and incredible     sometimes she imagined that delvile might formerly have been affianced  to some woman  who having accidentally discovered his intentions   took this desperate method of rendering them abortive  but this was a  short lived thought  and speedily gave way to her esteem for his general  character  and her confidence in the firmness of his probity     all  therefore  was dark and mysterious  conjecture was baffled  and  meditation was useless  her opinions were unfixed  and her heart was  miserable  she could only be steady in believing delvile as unhappy as  herself  and only find consolation in believing him  also  as blameless     three days passed thus  without incident or intelligence  her time  wholly occupied in attending mrs charlton  her thoughts all engrossed  upon her own situation  but upon the fourth day she was informed that a  lady was in the parlour  who desired to speak with her     she presently went down stairs   and  upon entering the room  perceived  mrs delvile     seized with astonishment and fear  she stopt short  and  looking aghast   held by the door  robbed of all power to receive so unexpected and  unwelcome a visitor  by an internal sensation of guilt  mingled with a  dread of discovery and reproach     mrs delvile  addressing her with the coldest politeness  said   i fear  i have surprised you  i am sorry i had not time to acquaint you of my  intention to wait upon you      cecilia then  moving from the door  faintly answered   i cannot  madam   but be honoured by your notice  whenever you are pleased to confer it      they then sat down  mrs delvile preserving an air the most formal and  distant  and cecilia half sinking with apprehensive dismay     after a short and ill boding silence   i mean not   said mrs delvile    to embarrass or distress you  i will not  therefore  keep you in  suspense of the purport of my visit  i come not to make enquiries   i come not to put your sincerity to any trial  nor to torture your  delicacy  i dispense with all explanation  for i have not one doubt to  solve  i  know  what has passed  i  know  that my son loves you      not all her secret alarm  nor all the perturbation of her fears  had  taught cecilia to expect so direct an attack  nor enabled her to bear  the shock of it with any composure  she could not speak  she could  not look at mrs delvile  she arose  and walked to the window  without  knowing what she was doing     here  however  her distress was not likely to diminish  for the first  sight she saw was fidel  who barked  and jumped up at the window to lick  her hands      good god  fidel here   exclaimed mrs delvile  amazed     cecilia  totally overpowered  covered her glowing face with both her  hands  and sunk into a chair     mrs delvile for a few minutes was silent  and then  following her  said    imagine not i am making any discovery  nor suspect me of any design  to develop your sentiments  that mortimer could love in vain i never   believed  that miss beverley  possessing so much merit  could be blind  to it in another  i never thought possible  i mean not  therefore  to  solicit any account or explanation  but merely to beg your patience  while i talk to you myself  and your permission to speak to you with  openness and truth      cecilia  though relieved by this calmness from all apprehension of  reproach  found in her manner a coldness that convinced her of the loss  of her affection  and in the introduction to her business a solemnity  that assured her what she should decree would be unalterable  she  uncovered her face to shew her respectful attention  but she could not  raise it up  and could not utter a word     mrs delvile then seated herself next her  and gravely continued her  discourse      miss beverley  however little acquainted with the state of our family  affairs  can scarcely have been uninformed that a fortune such as hers  seems almost all that family can desire  nor can she have failed to  observe  that her merit and accomplishments have no where been more felt  and admired  the choice therefore of mortimer she could not doubt would  have our sanction  and when she honoured his proposals with her favour   she might naturally conclude she gave happiness and pleasure to all his  friends      cecilia  superior to accepting a palliation of which she felt herself  undeserving  now lifted up her head  and forcing herself to speak   said  no  madam  i will not deceive you  for i have never been deceived  myself  i presumed not to expect your approbation   though in missing it  i have for ever lost my own       has mortimer  then   cried she with eagerness   been strictly  honourable  has he neither beguiled nor betrayed you       no  madam   said she  blushing   i have nothing to reproach him with       then he is indeed my son   cried mrs delvile  with emotion   had he  been treacherous to you  while disobedient to us  i had indisputably  renounced him      cecilia  who now seemed the only culprit  felt herself in a state of  humiliation not to be borne  she collected  therefore  all her courage   and said   i have cleared mr delvile  permit me  madam  now  to say  something for myself       certainly  you cannot oblige me more than by speaking without  disguise       it is not in the hope of regaining your good opinion   that  i see  is  lost   but merely        no  not lost   said mrs delvile   but if once it was yet higher  the  fault was my own  in indulging an expectation of perfection to which  human nature is perhaps unequal      ah  then  thought cecilia  all is over  the contempt i so much feared is  incurred  and though it may be softened  it can never be removed      speak  then  and with sincerity   she continued   all you wish me to  hear  and then grant me your attention in return to the purpose of my  present journey       i have little  madam   answered the depressed cecilia   to say  you  tell me you already know all that has past  i will not  therefore   pretend to take any merit from revealing it  i will only add  that my  consent to this transaction has made me miserable almost from the moment  i gave it  that i meant and wished to retract as soon as reflection  pointed out to me my error  and that circumstances the most perverse   not blindness to propriety  nor stubbornness in wrong  led me to make   at last  that fatal attempt  of which the recollection  to my last hour   must fill me with regret and shame       i wonder not   said mrs delvile   that in a situation where delicacy  was so much less requisite than courage  miss beverley should feel  herself distressed and unhappy  a mind such as hers could never err  with impunity  and it is solely from a certainty of her innate sense of  right  that i venture to wait upon her now  and that i have any hope  to influence  her  upon whose influence alone our whole family must in  future depend  shall i now proceed  or is there any thing you wish to  say first       no  madam  nothing       hear me  then  i beg of you  with no predetermination to disregard me   but with an equitable resolution to attend to reason  and a candour that  leaves an opening to conviction  not easy  indeed  is such a task  to  a mind pre occupied with an intention to be guided by the dictates of  inclination          you wrong me  indeed  madam   interrupted cecilia  greatly hurt   my  mind harbours no such intention  it has no desire but to be guided by  duty  it is wretched with a consciousness of having failed in it  i  pine  i sicken to recover my own good opinion  i should then no longer  feel unworthy of yours  and whether or not i might be able to regain it   i should at least lose this cruel depression that now sinks me in your  presence       to regain it   said mrs delvile   were to exercise but half your power   which at this moment enables you  if such is your wish  to make me think  of you more highly than one human being ever thought of another  do you  condescend to hold this worth your while      cecilia started at the question  her heart beat quick with struggling  passions  she saw the sacrifice which was to be required  and her pride   her affronted pride  arose high to anticipate the rejection  but the  design was combated by her affections  which opposed the indignant  rashness  and told her that one hasty speech might separate her from  delvile for ever  when this painful conflict was over  of which mrs  delvile patiently waited the issue  she answered  with much hesitation    to regain your good opinion  madam  greatly  truly as i value it   is  what i now scarcely dare hope       say not so   cried she   since  if you hope  you cannot miss it  i  purpose to point out to you the means to recover it  and to tell you  how greatly i shall think myself your debtor if you refuse not to employ  them      she stopt  but cecilia hung back  fearful of her own strength  she dared  venture at no professions  yet  how either to support  or dispute her  compliance  she dreaded to think      i come to you  then   mrs delvile solemnly resumed   in the name of mr  delvile  and in the name of our whole family  a family as ancient as  it is honourable  as honourable as it is ancient  consider me as its  representative  and hear in me its common voice  common opinion  and  common address      my son  the supporter of our house  the sole guardian of its name  and  the heir of our united fortunes  has selected you  we know  for the lady  of his choice  and so fondly has  fixed upon you his affections  that  he is ready to relinquish us all in preference to subduing them  to  yourself alone  then  can we apply  and i come to you        o hold  madam  hold   interrupted cecilia  whose courage now revived  from resentment   i know  what you would say  you come to tell me of  your disdain  you come to reproach my presumption  and to kill me with  your contempt  there is little occasion for such a step  i am depressed   i am self condemned already  spare me  therefore  this insupportable  humiliation  wound me not with your scorn  oppress me not with your  superiority  i aim at no competition  i attempt no vindication  i  acknowledge my own littleness as readily as you can despise it  and  nothing but indignity could urge me to defend it       believe me   said mrs delvile   i meant not to hurt or offend you  and  i am sorry if i have appeared to you either arrogant or assuming  the  peculiar and perilous situation of my family has perhaps betrayed me  into offensive expressions  and made me guilty myself of an ostentation  which in others has often disgusted me  ill  indeed  can we any of us  bear the test of experiment  when tried upon those subjects which call  forth our particular propensities  we may strive to be disinterested   we may struggle to be impartial  but self will still predominate  still  shew us the imperfection of our natures  and the narrowness of our  souls  yet acquit me  i beg  of any intentional insolence  and imagine  not that in speaking highly of my own family  i  mean to depreciate  yours  on the contrary  i know it to be respectable  i know  too  that  were it the lowest in the kingdom  the first might envy it that it gave  birth to such a daughter      cecilia  somewhat soothed by this speech  begged her pardon for having  interrupted her  and she proceeded      to your family  then  i assure you  whatever may be the pride of our  own   you  being its offspring  we would not object  with your merit we  are all well acquainted  your character has our highest esteem  and  your fortune exceeds even our most sanguine desires  strange at once  and afflicting  that not all these requisites for the satisfaction of  prudence  nor all these allurements for the gratification of happiness   can suffice to fulfil or to silence the claims of either  there are yet  other demands to which we must attend  demands which ancestry and blood  call upon us aloud to ratify  such claimants are not to be neglected  with impunity  they assert their rights with the authority of  prescription  they forbid us alike either to bend to inclination  or  stoop to interest  and from generation to generation their injuries  will call out for redress  should their noble and long unsullied name be  voluntarily consigned to oblivion      cecilia  extremely struck by these words  scarce wondered  since so  strong and so established were her opinions  that the obstacle to her  marriage  though but one  should be considered as insuperable      not  therefore  to  your  name are we averse   she continued   but  simply to our own more partial  to sink that  indeed  in  any   other  were base and unworthy   what  then  must be the shock of my  disappointment  should mortimer delvile  the darling of my hopes  the  last survivor of his house  in whose birth i rejoiced as the promise of  its support  in whose accomplishments i gloried  as the revival of its  lustre   should  he   should   my  son be the first to abandon it  to  give up the name he seemed born to make live  and to cause in effect its  utter annihilation   oh how should i know my son when an alien to his  family  how bear to think i had cherished in my bosom the betrayer of  its dearest interests  the destroyer of its very existence      cecilia  scarce more afflicted than offended  now hastily answered   not  for me  madam  shall he commit this crime  not on  my  account shall he  be reprobated by his family  think of him  therefore  no more  with any  reference to me  for i would not be the cause of unworthiness or guilt  in him to be mistress of the universe       nobly said   cried mrs delvile  her eyes sparkling with joy  and her  cheeks glowing with pleasure   now again do i know miss beverley  now  again see the refined  the excellent young woman  whose virtues taught  me to expect the renunciation even of her own happiness  when found to  be incompatible with her duty      cecilia now trembled and turned pale  she scarce knew herself what she  had said  but  she found by mrs delvile s construction of her words   they had been regarded as her final relinquishing of her son  she  ardently wished to quit the room before she was called upon to confirm  the sentence  but  she had not courage to make the effort  nor to rise   speak  or move      i grieve  indeed   continued mrs delvile  whose coldness and austerity  were changed into mildness and compassion   at the necessity i have been  under to draw from you a concurrence so painful  but no other resource  was in my power  my influence with mortimer  whatever it may be  i have  not any right to try  without obtaining your previous consent  since i  regard him myself as bound to you in honour  and only to be released by  your own virtuous desire  i will leave you  however  for my presence   i see  is oppressive to you  farewell  and when you  can  forgive me  i  think you  will        i have nothing  madam   said cecilia  coldly   to forgive  you have  only asserted your own dignity  and i have nobody to blame but myself   for having given you occasion       alas   cried mrs delvile   if worth and nobleness of soul on your part   if esteem and tenderest affection on mine  were all which that dignity  which offends you requires  how should i crave the blessing of such a  daughter  how rejoice in joining my son to excellence so like his own   and ensuring his happiness while i stimulated his virtue       do not talk to me of affection  madam   said cecilia  turning away from  her   whatever you had for me is past   even your esteem is gone   you  may pity me  indeed  but your pity is mixed with contempt  and i am not  so abject as to find comfort from exciting it       o little   cried mrs delvile  looking at her with the utmost  tenderness   little do you see the state of my heart  for never have you  appeared to me so worthy as at this moment  in tearing you from my son   i partake all the wretchedness i give  but your own sense of duty must  something plead for the strictness with which i act up to mine      she then moved towards the door      is your carriage  madam   said cecilia  struggling to disguise her  inward anguish under an appearance of sullenness   in waiting      mrs delvile then came back  and holding out her hand  while her eyes  glistened with tears  said   to part from you thus frigidly  while  my heart so warmly admires you  is almost more than i can endure  oh  gentlest cecilia  condemn not a mother who is impelled to this severity   who performing what she holds to be her duty  thinks the office her  bitterest misfortune  who forsees in the rage of her husband  and the  resistance of her son  all the misery of domestic contention  and who  can only secure the honour of her family by destroying its peace   you  will not  then  give me your hand        cecilia  who had affected not to see that she waited for it  now  coldly put it out  distantly  courtseying   and seeking to preserve  her steadiness by avoiding to speak  mrs delvile took it  and as she  repeated her adieu  affectionately pressed it to her lips  cecilia   starting  and breathing short  from encreasing yet smothered agitation   called out  why  why this condescension   pray   i entreat you   madam         heaven bless you  my love   said mrs delvile  dropping a tear upon the  hand she still held   heaven bless you  and restore the tranquillity you  so nobly deserve       ah madam   cried cecilia  vainly striving to repress any longer the  tears which now forced their way down her cheeks   why will you break  my heart with this kindness  why will you still compel me to love   when  now i almost wish to hate you         no  hate me not   said mrs delvile  kissing from her cheeks the tears  that watered them   hate me not  sweetest cecilia  though in wounding  your gentle bosom  i am almost detestable to myself  even the cruel  scene which awaits me with my son will not more deeply afflict me  but  adieu   i must now prepare for him      she then left the room  but cecilia  whose pride had no power to resist  this tenderness  ran hastily after her  saying  shall i not see you  again  madam       you shall yourself decide   answered she   if my coming will not give  you more pain than pleasure  i will wait upon you whenever you please      cecilia sighed and paused  she knew not what to desire  yet rather  wished any thing to be done  than quietly to sit down to uninterrupted  reflection      shall i postpone quitting this place   continued mrs delvile   till  to morrow morning  and will you admit me this afternoon  should i call  upon you again       i should be sorry   said she  still hesitating   to detain you         you will rejoice me   cried mrs delvile   by bearing me in your sight      and she then went into her carriage     cecilia  unfitted to attend her old friend  and unequal to the task of  explaining to her the cruel scene in which she had just been engaged   then hastened to her own apartment  her hitherto stifled emotions broke  forth in tears and repinings  her fate was finally determined  and its  determination was not more unhappy than humiliating  she was openly  rejected by the family whose alliance she was known to wish  she  was compelled to refuse the man of her choice  though satisfied his  affections were her own  a misery so peculiar she found hard to support   and almost bursting with conflicting passions  her heart alternately  swelled from offended pride  and sunk from disappointed tenderness         chapter iv     a perturbation     cecelia was still in this tempestuous state  when a message was brought  her that a gentleman was below stairs  who begged to have the honour of  seeing her  she concluded he was delvile  and the thought of meeting him  merely to communicate what must so bitterly afflict him  redoubled her  distress  and she went down in an agony of perturbation and sorrow     he met her at the door  where  before he could speak   mr delvile    she cried  in a hurrying manner   why will you come  why will you thus  insist upon seeing me  in defiance of every obstacle  and in contempt of  my prohibition       good heavens   cried he  amazed   whence this reproach  did you not  permit me to wait upon you with the result of my enquiries  had i  not your consent  but why do you look thus disturbed   your eyes are  red   you have been weeping   oh my cecilia  have i any share in your  sorrow   those tears  which never flow weakly  tell me  have they  has   one  of them been shed upon my account       and what   cried she   has been the result of your enquiries   speak  quick  for i wish to know   and in another instant i must be gone       how strange   cried the astonished delvile   is this language  how  strange are these looks  what new has come to pass  has any fresh  calamity happened  is there yet some evil which i do not expect       why will you not answer first   cried she   when  i  have spoken  you  will perhaps be less willing       you terrify  you shock  you amaze me  what dreadful blow awaits me  for  what horror are you preparing me   that which i have just experienced   and which tore you from me even at the foot of the altar  still remains  inexplicable  still continues to be involved in darkness and mystery   for the wretch who separated us i have never been able to discover       have you procured  then  no intelligence       no  none  though since we parted i have never rested a moment       make  then  no further enquiry  for now all explanation would be  useless  that we  were  parted  we know  though  why  we cannot tell   but that again we shall ever meet        she  stopt  her streaming eyes cast upwards  and a deep sigh bursting  from her heart      oh what   cried delvile  endeavouring to take her hand  which she  hastily withdrew from him   what does this mean  loveliest  dearest  cecilia  my betrothed  my affianced wife  why flow those tears which  agony only can wring from you  why refuse me that hand which so lately  was the pledge of your faith  am i not the same delvile to whom so few  days since you gave it  why will you not open to him your heart  why  thus distrust his honour  and repulse his tenderness  oh why  giving him  such exquisite misery  refuse him the smallest consolation       what consolation   cried the weeping cecilia   can i give  alas  it is  not  perhaps   you  who most want it        here the door was opened by one of the miss charltons  who came into  the room with a message from her grandmother  requesting to see cecilia   cecilia  ashamed of being thus surprised with delvile  and in tears   waited not either to make any excuse to him  or any answer to miss  charlton  but instantly hurried out of the room   not  however  to  her old friend  whom now less than ever she could meet  but to her own  apartment  where a very short indulgence of grief was succeeded by the  severest examination of her own conduct     a retrospection of this sort rarely brings much subject of exultation   when made with the rigid sincerity of secret impartiality  so much  stronger is our reason than our virtue  so much higher our sense of duty  than our performance     all she had done she now repented  all she had said she disapproved  her  conduct  seldom equal to her notions of right  was now infinitely below  them  and the reproaches of her judgment made her forget for a while the  afflictions which had misled it     the sorrow to which she had openly given way in the presence of delvile   though their total separation but the moment before had been finally  decreed  she considered as a weak effusion of tenderness  injurious to  delicacy  and censurable by propriety   his power over my heart   cried  she   it were now  indeed  too late to conceal  but his power over my  understanding it is time to cancel  i am not to be his   my own voice  has ratified the renunciation  and since i made it to his mother  it  must never  without her consent  be invalidated  honour  therefore  to  her  and regard for myself  equally command me to fly him  till i cease  to be thus affected by his sight      when delvile  therefore  sent up an entreaty that he might be again  admitted into her presence  she returned for answer that she was not  well  and could not see any body     he then left the house  and  in a few minutes  she received the  following note from him      to miss beverley   you drive me from you  cecilia  tortured with  suspense  and distracted with apprehension  you drive me from you   certain of my misery  yet leaving me to bear it as i may  i would call  you unfeeling  but that i saw you were unhappy  i would reproach you  with tyranny  but that your eyes when you quitted me were swollen with  weeping  i go  therefore  i obey the harsh mandate  since my absence is  your desire  and i will shut myself up at biddulph s till i receive  your commands  yet disdain not to reflect that every instant will seem  endless  while cecilia must appear to me unjust  or wound my very soul  by the recollection of her in sorrow  mortimer delvile     the mixture of fondness and resentment with which this letter was  dictated  marked so strongly the sufferings and disordered state of the  writer  that all the softness of cecilia returned when she perused it   and left her not a wish but to lessen his inquietude  by assurances  of unalterable regard  yet she determined not to trust herself in his  sight  certain they could only meet to grieve over each other  and  conscious that a participation of sorrow would but prove a reciprocation  of tenderness  calling  therefore  upon her duty to resist her  inclination  she resolved to commit the whole affair to the will of mrs  delvile  to whom  though under no promise  she now considered herself  responsible  desirous  however  to shorten the period of delvile s  uncertainty  she would not wait till the time she had appointed to see  his mother  but wrote the following note to hasten their meeting      to the hon  mrs delvile   madam   your son is now at bury  shall i  acquaint him of your arrival  or will you announce it yourself  inform  me of your desire  and i will endeavour to fulfil it  as my own agent  i regard myself no longer  if  as yours  i can give pleasure  or be of  service  i shall gladly receive your commands  i have the honour to be   madam  your most obedient servant  cecilia beverley     when she had sent off this letter  her heart was more at ease  because  reconciled with her conscience  she had sacrificed the son  she had  resigned herself to the mother  it now only remained to heal her wounded  pride  by suffering the sacrifice with dignity  and to recover her  tranquility in virtue  by making the resignation without repining     her reflections  too  growing clearer as the mist of passion was  dispersed  she recollected with confusion her cold and sullen behaviour  to mrs delvile  that lady had but done what she had believed was her  duty  and that duty was no more than she had been taught to expect from  her  in the beginning of her visit  and while doubtful of its success   she had indeed  been austere  but the moment victory appeared in view   she became tender  affectionate and gentle  her justice  therefore   condemned the resentment to which she had given way  and she fortified  her mind for the interview which was to follow  by an earnest desire to  make all reparation both to mrs delvile and herself for that which was  past     in this resolution she was not a little strengthened  by seriously  considering with herself the great abatement to all her possible  happiness  which must have been made by the humiliating circumstance  of forcing herself into a family which held all connection with her as  disgraceful  she desired not to be the wife even of delvile upon such  terms  for the more she esteemed and admired him  the more anxious she  became for his honour  and the less could she endure being regarded  herself as the occasion of its diminution     now  therefore  her plan of conduct settled  with calmer spirits  though  a heavy heart  she attended upon mrs charlton  but fearing to lose the  steadiness she had just acquired before it should be called upon  if she  trusted herself to relate the decision which had been made  she besought  her for the present to dispense with the account  and then forced  herself into conversation upon less interesting subjects     this prudence had its proper effect  and with tolerable tranquility she  heard mrs delvile again announced  and waited upon her in the parlour  with an air of composure     not so did mrs delvile receive her  she was all eagerness and emotion   she flew to her the moment she appeared  and throwing her arms around  her  warmly exclaimed  oh charming girl  saver of our family  preserver  of our honour  how poor are words to express my admiration  how  inadequate are thanks in return for such obligations as i owe you       you owe me none  madam   said cecilia  suppressing a sigh   on my side  will be all the obligation  if you can pardon the petulance of my  behaviour this morning       call not by so harsh a name   answered mrs delvile   the keenness of a  sensibility by which you have yourself alone been the sufferer  you  have had a trial the most severe  and however able to sustain  it was  impossible you should not feel it  that you should give up any man whose  friends solicit not your alliance  your mind is too delicate to make  wonderful  but your generosity in submitting  unasked  the arrangement  of that resignation to those for whose interest it is made  and your  high sense of honour in holding yourself accountable to me  though under  no tie  and bound by no promise  mark a greatness of mind which calls  for reverence rather than thanks  and which i never can praise half so  much as i admire      cecilia  who received this applause but as a confirmation of her  rejection  thanked her only by courtsying  and mrs delvile  having  seated herself next her  continued her speech      my son  you have the goodness to tell me  is here   have you seen him       yes  madam   answered she  blushing   but hardly for a moment       and he knows not of my arrival   no   i believe he certainly does not       sad then  is the trial which awaits him  and heavy for me the office i  must perform  do you expect to see him again       no   yes   perhaps  indeed i hardly    she stammered  and mrs delvile   taking her hand  said  tell me  miss beverley   why  should you see him  again      cecilia was thunderstruck by this question  and  colouring yet more  deeply  looked down  but could not answer      consider   continued mrs delvile   the  purpose  of any further  meeting  your union is impossible  you have nobly consented to  relinquish all thoughts of it why then tear your own heart  and torture  his  by an intercourse which seems nothing but an ill judged invitation  to fruitless and unavailing sorrow      cecilia was still silent  the truth of the expostulation her reason  acknowledged  but to assent to its consequence her whole heart refused      the ungenerous triumph of little female vanity   said mrs delvile   is  far  i am sure  from your mind  of which the enlargement and liberality  will rather find consolation from lessening than from embittering  his sufferings  speak to me  then  and tell me honestly  judiciously   candidly tell me  will it not be wiser and more right  to avoid rather  than seek an object which can only give birth to regret  an interview  which can excite no sensations but of misery and sadness   cecilia then  turned pale  she endeavoured to speak  but could not  she wished to  comply   yet to think she had seen him for the last time  to remember  how abruptly she had parted from him  and to fear she had treated him  unkindly   these were obstacles which opposed her concurrence  though  both judgment and propriety demanded it      can you  then   said mrs delvile  after a pause   can you wish to see  mortimer merely to behold his grief  can you desire he should see you   only to sharpen his affliction at your loss       o no   cried cecilia  to whom this reproof restored speech and  resolution   i am not so despicable  i am not  i hope  so unworthy   i  will  be ruled by you wholly  i will commit to you every thing   yet   once   perhaps   no more         ah  my dear miss beverley  to meet confessedly for  once    what were  that but planting a dagger in the heart of mortimer  what were it but  infusing poison into your own      if you think so  madam   said she   i had better  i will certainly     she sighed  stammered  and stopt      hear me   cried mrs delvile   and rather let me try to convince than  persuade you  were there any possibility  by argument  by reflection  or  even by accident  to remove the obstacles to our connection  then would  it be well to meet  for then might discussion turn to account  and an  interchange of sentiments be productive of some happy expedients  but  here       she hesitated  and cecilia  shocked and ashamed  turned away her face   and cried  i know  madam  what you would say   here all is over  and  therefore        yet suffer me   interrupted she   to be explicit  since we speak upon   this matter now for the last time  here  then  i say  where not one  doubt remains  where all is finally  though not happily decided  what  can an interview produce  mischief of every sort  pain  horror  and  repining  to mortimer you may think it would be kind  and grant it to  his prayers  as an alleviation of his misery  mistaken notion  nothing  could so greatly augment it  all his passions would be raised  all his  prudence would be extinguished  his soul would be torn with resentment  and regret  and force  only  would part him from you  when previously he  knew that parting was to be eternal  to yourself        talk not  madam  of me   cried the unhappy cecilia   what you say of  your son is sufficient  and i will yield         yet hear me   proceeded she   and believe me not so unjust as to  consider him alone  you  also  would be an equal  though a less stormy  sufferer  you fancy  at this moment  that once more to meet him would  soothe your uneasiness  and that to take of him a farewell  would soften  the pain of the separation  how false such reasoning  how dangerous such  consolation  acquainted ere you meet that you were to meet him no more   your heart would be all softness and grief  and at the very moment when  tenderness should be banished from your intercourse  it would bear down  all opposition of judgment  spirit  and dignity  you would hang upon  every word  because every word would seem the last  every look  every  expression would be rivetted in your memory  and his image in this  parting distress would be painted upon your mind  in colours that would  eat into its peace  and perhaps never be erased       enough  enough   said cecilia   i will not see him   i will not even  desire it       is this compliance or conviction  is what i have said true  or only  terrifying       both  both  i believe  indeed  the conflict would have overpowered  me   i see you are right   and i thank you  madam  for saving me from a  scene i might so cruelly have rued       oh daughter of my mind   cried mrs delvile  rising and embracing her    noble  generous  yet gentle cecilia  what tie  what connection  could  make you more dear to me  who is there like you  who half so excellent   so open to reason  so ingenuous in error  so rational  so just  so  feeling  yet so wise       you are very good   said cecilia  with a forced serenity   and i am  thankful that your resentment for the past obstructs not your lenity for  the present       alas  my love  how shall i resent the past  when i ought myself to have  foreseen this calamity  and i  should  have foreseen it  had i not been  informed you were engaged  and upon your engagement built our security   else had i been more alarmed  for my own admiration would have bid me  look forward to my son s  you were just  indeed  the woman he had least  chance to resist  you were precisely the character to seize his very  soul  to a softness the most fatally alluring  you join a dignity which  rescues from their own contempt even the most humble of your admirers   you seem born to have all the world wish your exaltation  and no part  of it murmur at your superiority  were any obstacle but this insuperable  one in the way  should nobles  nay  should princes offer their daughters  to my election  i would reject without murmuring the most magnificent  proposals  and take in triumph to my heart my son s nobler choice       oh madam   cried cecilia   talk not to me thus   speak not such  flattering words   ah  rather scorn and upbraid me  tell me you  despise my character  my family and my connections   load  load me with  contempt  but do not thus torture me with approbation       pardon me  sweetest girl  if i have awakened those emotions you so  wisely seek to subdue  may my son but emulate your example  and my pride  in his virtue shall be the solace of my affliction for his misfortunes      she then tenderly embraced her  and abruptly took her leave     cecilia had now acted her part  and acted it to her own satisfaction   but the curtain dropt when mrs delvile left the house  nature resumed  her rights  and the sorrow of her heart was no longer disguised or  repressed  some faint ray of hope had till now broke through the  gloomiest cloud of her misery  and secretly flattered her that its  dispersion was possible  though distant  but that ray was extinct  that  hope was no more  she had solemnly promised to banish delvile her sight   and his mother had absolutely declared that even the subject had been  discussed for the last time     mrs charlton  impatient of some explanation of the morning s  transactions  soon sent again to beg cecilia would come to her  cecilia  reluctantly obeyed  for she feared encreasing her indisposition by the  intelligence she had to communicate  she struggled  therefore  to appear  to her with tolerable calmness  and in briefly relating what had passed   forbore to mingle with the narrative her own feelings and unhappiness     mrs charlton heard the account with the utmost concern  she accused  mrs delvile of severity  and even of cruelty  she lamented the strange  accident by which the marriage ceremony had been stopt  and regretted  that it had not again been begun  as the only means to have rendered  ineffectual the present fatal interposition  but the grief of cecilia   however violent  induced her not to join in this regret  she mourned  only the obstacle which had occasioned the separation  and not the  incident which had merely interrupted the ceremony  convinced  by the  conversations in which she had just been engaged  of mrs delvile s  inflexibility  she rather rejoiced than repined that she had put it to  no nearer trial  sorrow was all she felt  for her mind was too liberal  to harbour resentment against a conduct which she saw was dictated by a  sense of right  and too ductile and too affectionate to remain unmoved  by the personal kindness which had softened the rejection  and the many  marks of esteem and regard which had shewn her it was lamented  though  considered as indispensable     how and by whom this affair had been betrayed to mrs delvile she knew  not  but the discovery was nothing less than surprising  since  by  various unfortunate accidents  it was known to so many  and since  in  the horror and confusion of the mysterious prohibition to the marriage   neither delvile nor herself had thought of even attempting to give  any caution to the witnesses of that scene  not to make it known  an  attempt  however  which must almost necessarily have been unavailing  as  the incident was too extraordinary and too singular to have any chance  of suppression     during this conversation  one of the servants came to inform cecilia   that a man was below to enquire if there was no answer to the note he  had brought in the forenoon     cecilia  greatly distressed  knew not upon what to resolve  that the  patience of delvile should be exhausted  she did not  indeed  wonder   and to relieve his anxiety was now almost her only wish  she would  therefore instantly have written to him  confessed her sympathy in his  sufferings  and besought him to endure with fortitude an evil which  was no longer to be withstood  but she was uncertain whether he was yet  acquainted with the journey of his mother to bury  and having agreed to  commit to her the whole management of the affair  she feared it would  be dishonourable to take any step in it without her concurrence  she  returned  therefore  a message that she had yet no answer ready     in a very few minutes delvile called himself  and sent up an earnest  request for permission to see her     here  at least  she had no perplexity  an interview she had given her  positive word to refuse  and therefore  without a moment s hesitation   she bid the servant inform him she was particularly engaged  and sorry  it was not in her power to see any company     in the greatest perturbation he left the house  and immediately wrote to  her the following lines      to miss beverley   i entreat you to see me  if only for an instant  i  entreat  i implore you to see me  mrs charlton may be present  all the  world  if you wish it  may be present   but deny me not admission  i  supplicate  i conjure you     i will call in an hour  in that time you may have finished your present  engagement  i will otherwise wait longer  and call again  you will not   i think  turn me from  your door  and  till i have seen you  i can only  live in its vicinity  m  d     the man who brought this note  waited not for any answer     cecilia read it in an agony of mind inexpressible  she saw  by its  style  how much delvile was irritated  and her knowledge of his temper  made her certain his irritation proceeded from believing himself  ill used  she ardently wished to appease and to quiet him  and regretted  the necessity of appearing obdurate and unfeeling  even more  at that  moment  than the separation itself  to a mind priding in its purity   and animated in its affections  few sensations can excite keener misery   than those by which an apprehension is raised of being thought worthless  or ungrateful by the objects of our chosen regard  to be deprived of  their society is less bitter  to be robbed of our own tranquillity by  any other means  is less afflicting     yet to this it was necessary to submit  or incur the only penalty which   to such a mind  would be more severe  self reproach  she had promised to  be governed by mrs delvile  she had nothing  therefore  to do but obey  her     yet  to turn   as he expressed himself   from the door   a man who   but for an incident the most incomprehensible  would now have been sole  master of herself and her actions  seemed so unkind and so tyrannical   that she could not endure to be within hearing of his repulse  she  begged  therefore  the use of mrs charlton s carriage  and determined  to make a visit to mrs harrel till delvile and his mother had wholly  quitted bury  she was not  indeed  quite satisfied in going to the house  of mr arnott  but she had no time to weigh objections  and knew not any  other place to which still greater might not be started     she wrote a short letter to mrs delvile  acquainting her with her  purpose  and its reason  and repeating her assurances that she would  be guided by her implicitly  and then  embracing mrs charlton  whom  she left to the care of her grand daughters  she got into a chaise   accompanied only by her maid  and one man and horse  and ordered the  postilion to drive to mr arnott s         chapter v     a cottage     the evening was already far advanced  and before she arrived at the end  of her little journey it was quite dark  when they came within a mile  of mr arnott s house  the postilion  in turning too suddenly from the  turnpike to the cross road  overset the carriage  the accident  however   occasioned no other mischief than delaying their proceeding  and  cecilia and her maid were helped out of the chaise unhurt  the servants   assisted by a man who was walking upon the road  began lifting it up   and cecilia  too busy within to be attentive to what passed without   disregarded what went forward  till she heard her footman call for help   she then hastily advanced to enquire what was the matter  and found  that the passenger who had lent his aid  had  by working in the dark   unfortunately slipped his foot under one of the wheels  and so much hurt  it  that without great pain he could not put it to the ground     cecilia immediately desired that the sufferer might be carried to his  own home in the chaise  while she and the maid walked on to mr arnott s   attended by her servant on horseback     this little incident proved of singular service to her upon first  entering the house  mrs harrel was at supper with her brother  and  hearing the voice of cecilia in the hall  hastened with the extremest  surprise to enquire what had occasioned so late a visit  followed by mr  arnott  whose amazement was accompanied with a thousand other sensations  too powerful for speech  cecilia  unprepared with any excuse  instantly  related the adventure she had met with on the road  which quieted their  curiosity  by turning their attention to her personal safety  they  ordered a room to be prepared for her  entreated her to go to rest with  all speed  and postpone any further account till the next day  with this  request she most gladly complied  happy to be spared the embarrassment  of enquiry  and rejoiced to be relieved from the fatigue of  conversation  her night was restless and miserable  to know how delvile  would bear her flight was never a moment from her thoughts  and to hear  whether he would obey or oppose his mother was her incessant wish  she  was fixt  however  to be faithful in refusing to see him  and at least  to suffer nothing new from her own enterprize or fault     early in the morning mrs harrel came to see her  she was eager to learn  why  after invitations repeatedly refused  she was thus suddenly arrived  without any  and she was still more eager to talk of herself  and relate  the weary life she led thus shut up in the country  and confined to the  society of her brother     cecilia evaded giving any immediate answer to her questions  and mrs  harrel  happy in an opportunity to rehearse her own complaints  soon  forgot that she had asked any  and  in a very short time  was perfectly   though imperceptibly  contented to be herself the only subject upon  which they conversed     but not such was the selfishness of mr arnott  and cecilia  when she  went down to breakfast  perceived with the utmost concern that he  had passed a night as sleepless as her own  a visit so sudden  so  unexpected  and so unaccountable  from an object that no discouragement  could make him think of with indifference  had been a subject to him of  conjecture and wonder that had revived all the hopes and the fears which  had lately  though still unextinguished  lain dormant  the enquiries   however  which his sister had given up  he ventured not to renew  and  thought himself but too happy in her presence  whatever might be the  cause of her visit     he perceived  however  immediately  the sadness that hung upon her mind   and his own was redoubled by the sight  mrs harrel  also  saw that she  looked ill  but attributed it to the fatigue and fright of the preceding  evening  well knowing that a similar accident would have made her ill  herself  or fancy that she was so     during breakfast  cecilia sent for the postilion  to enquire of him how  the man had fared  whose good natured assistance in their distress had  been so unfortunate to himself  he answered that he had turned out to  be a day labourer  who lived about half a mile off  and then  partly to  gratify her own humanity  and partly to find any other employment for  herself and friends than uninteresting conversation  she proposed that  they should all walk to the poor man s habitation  and offer him some  amends for the injury he had received  this was readily assented to   and the postilion directed them whither to go  the place was a cottage   situated upon a common  they entered it without ceremony  and found a  clean looking woman at work     cecilia enquired for her husband  and was told that he was gone out to  day labour      i am very glad to hear it   returned she   i hope then he has got the  better of the accident he met with last night       it was not him  madam   said the woman   met with the accident  it was  john   there he is  working in the garden      to the garden then they all went  and saw him upon the ground  weeding     the moment they approached he arose  and  without speaking  began to  limp  for he could hardly walk  away      i am sorry  master   said cecilia   that you are so much hurt  have you  had anything put to your foot      the man made no answer  but still turned away from her  a glance   however  of his eye  which the next instant he fixed upon the ground   startled her  she moved round to look at him again   and perceived mr  belfield      good god   she exclaimed  but seeing him still retreat  she recollected  in a moment how little he would be obliged to her for betraying him  and  suffering him to go on  turned back to her party  and led the way again  into the house     as soon as the first emotion of her surprise was over  she enquired how  long john had belonged to this cottage  and what was his way of life     the woman answered he had only been with them a week  and that he went  out to day labour with her husband     cecilia then  finding their stay kept him from his employment  and  willing to save him the distress of being seen by mr arnott or mrs  harrel  proposed their returning home  she grieved most sincerely at  beholding in so melancholy an occupation a young man of such talents and  abilities  she wished much to assist him  and began considering by what  means it might be done  when  as they were walking from the cottage  a  voice at some distance called out  madam  miss beverley   and  looking  round  to her utter amazement she saw belfield endeavouring to follow  her     she instantly stopt  and he advanced  his hat in his hand  and his whole  air indicating he sought not to be disguised     surprised at this sudden change of behaviour  she then stept forward  to meet him  accompanied by her friends  but when they came up to each  other  she checked her desire of speaking  to leave him fully at liberty  to make himself known  or keep concealed     he bowed with a look of assumed gaiety and ease  but the deep scarlet  that tinged his whole face manifested his internal confusion  and in  a voice that attempted to sound lively  though its tremulous accents  betrayed uneasiness and distress  he exclaimed  with a forced smile    is it possible miss beverley can deign to notice a poor miserable  day labourer such as i am  how will she be justified in the beau monde   when even the sight of such a wretch ought to fill her with horror   henceforth let hysterics be blown to the winds  and let nerves be  discarded from the female vocabulary  since a lady so young and fair can  stand this shock without hartshorn or fainting       i am happy   answered cecilia   to find your spirits so good  yet  my own  i must confess  are not raised by seeing you in this strange  situation       my spirits   cried he  with an air of defiance   never were they  better  never so good as at this moment  strange as seems my situation   it is all that i wish  i have found out  at last  the true secret of  happiness  that secret which so long i pursued in vain  but which always  eluded my grasp  till the instant of despair arrived  when  slackening  my pace  i gave it up as a phantom  go from me  i cried  i will be  cheated no more  thou airy bubble  thou fleeting shadow  i will live no  longer in thy sight  since thy beams dazzle without warming me  mankind  seems only composed as matter for thy experiments  and i will quit the  whole race  that thy delusions may be presented to me no more      this romantic flight  which startled even cecilia  though acquainted  with his character  gave to mrs harrel and mr arnott the utmost  surprize  his appearance  and the account they had just heard of him   having by no means prepared them for such sentiments or such language      is then this great secret of happiness   said cecilia   nothing  at  last  but total seclusion from the world       no  madam   answered he   it is labour with independence      cecilia now wished much to ask some explanation of his affairs  but was  doubtful whether he would gratify her before mrs harrel and mr arnott   and hurt to keep him standing  though he leant upon a stick  she told  him  therefore  she would at present detain him no longer  but endeavour  again to see him before she quitted her friends     mr arnott then interfered  and desired his sister would entreat miss  beverley to invite whom she pleased to his house     cecilia thanked him  and instantly asked belfield to call upon her in  the afternoon      no  madam  no   cried he   i have done with visits and society  i will  not so soon break through a system with much difficulty formed  when all  my future tranquility depends upon adhering to it  the worthlessness of  mankind has disgusted me with the world  and my resolution in quitting  it shall be immoveable as its baseness       i must not venture then   said cecilia   to enquire        enquire  madam   interrupted he  with quickness   what you please   there is nothing i will not answer to you   to this lady  to this  gentleman  to any and to every body  what can i wish to conceal  where  i have nothing to gain or to lose  when first  indeed  i saw you  i  involuntarily shrunk  a weak shame for a moment seized me  i felt  fallen and debased  and i wished to avoid you  but a little recollection  brought me back to my senses  and where  cried i  is the disgrace of  exercising for my subsistence the strength with which i am endued   and why should i blush to lead the life which uncorrupted nature first  prescribed to man       well  then   said cecilia  more and more interested to hear him   if  you will not visit us  will you at least permit us to return with you to  some place where you can be seated       i will with pleasure   cried he   go to any place where you may be  seated yourselves  but for me  i have ceased to regard accommodation or  inconvenience      they then all went back to the cottage  which was now empty  the woman  being out at work      will you then  sir   said cecilia   give me leave to enquire whether  lord vannelt is acquainted with your retirement  and if it will not much  surprize and disappoint him       lord vannelt   cried he  haughtily   has no right to be surprised  i  would have quitted  his  house  if no other  not even this cottage  had  a roof to afford me shelter       i am sorry  indeed  to hear it   said cecilia   i had hoped he would  have known your value  and merited your regard       ill usage   answered he   is as hard to relate as to be endured  there  is commonly something pitiful in a complaint  and though oppression in  a general sense provokes the wrath of mankind  the investigation of its  minuter circumstances excites nothing but derision  those who give the  offence  by the worthy few may be hated  but those who receive it  by  the world at large will be despised  conscious of this  i disdained  making any appeal  myself the only sufferer  i had a right to be  the only judge  and  shaking off the base trammels of interest and  subjection  i quitted the house in silent indignation  not chusing to  remonstrate  where i desired not to be reconciled       and was there no mode of life   said cecilia   to adopt  but living  with lord vannelt  or giving up the whole world       i weighed every thing maturely   answered he   before i made my  determination  and i found it so much  the most eligible  that i am  certain i can never repent it  i had friends who would with pleasure  have presented me to some other nobleman  but my whole heart revolted  against leading that kind of life  and i would not  therefore  idly rove  from one great man to another  adding ill will to disgrace  and pursuing  hope in defiance of common sense  no  when i quitted lord vannelt  i  resolved to give up patronage for ever      i retired to private lodgings to deliberate what next could be done  i  had lived in many ways  i had been unfortunate or imprudent in all   the law i had tried  but its rudiments were tedious and disgusting  the  army  too  but there found my mind more fatigued with indolence  than my  body with action  general dissipation had then its turn  but the expence  to which it led was ruinous  and self reproach baffled pleasure while  i pursued it  i have even  yes  there are few things i have left  untried   i have even   for why now disguise it        he stopt and coloured  but in a quicker voice presently proceeded      trade  also  has had its share in my experiments  for that  in truth   i was originally destined   but my education had ill suited me to such a  destination  and the trader s first maxim i reversed  in lavishing when  i ought to have accumulated      what  then  remained for me  to run over again the same irksome round i  had not patience  and to attempt any thing new i was unqualified  money  i had none  my friends i could bear to burthen no longer  a fortnight i  lingered in wretched irresolution   a simple accident at the end of it  happily settled me  i was walking  one morning  in hyde park  forming a  thousand plans for my future life  but quarrelling with them all  when  a gentleman met me on horseback  from whom  at my lord vannelt s  i had  received particular civilities  i looked another way not to be seen  by him  and the change in my dress since i left his lordship s made me  easily pass unnoticed  he had rode on  however  but a few yards   before  by some accident or mismanagement  he had a fall from his horse   forgetting all my caution  i flew instantly to his assistance  he was  bruised  but not otherwise hurt  i helpt him up  and he leant  pon my  arm  in my haste of enquiring how he had fared  i called him by his  name  he knew me  but looked surprised at my appearance  he was speaking  to me  however  with kindness  when seeing some gentlemen of his  acquaintance gallopping up to him  he hastily disengaged himself from  me  and instantly beginning to recount to them what had happened  he  sedulously looked another way  and joining his new companions  walked  off without taking further notice of me  for a moment i was almost  tempted to trouble him to come back  but a little recollection told me  how ill he deserved my resentment  and bid me transfer it for the future  from the pitiful individual to the worthless community      here finished my deliberation  the disgust to the world which i had  already conceived  this little incident confirmed  i saw it was only  made for the great and the rich   poor  therefore  and low  what had  i to do in it  i determined to quit it for ever  and to end every  disappointment  by crushing every hope      i wrote to lord vannelt to send my trunks to my mother  i wrote to my  mother that i was well  and would soon let her hear more  i then paid  off my lodgings  and  shaking the dust from my feet   bid a long adieu  to london  and  committing my route to chance  strole on into the  country  without knowing or caring which way      my first thought was simply to seek retirement  and to depend for my  future repose upon nothing but a total seclusion from society  but my  slow method of travelling gave me time for reflection  and reflection  soon showed me the error of this notion      guilt  cried i  may  indeed  be avoided by solitude  but will misery   will regret  will deep dejection of mind  no  they will follow more  assiduously than ever  for what is there to oppose them  where neither  business occupies the time  nor hope the imagination  where the past  has left nothing but resentment  and the future opens only to a dismal   uninteresting void  no stranger to life  i knew human nature could not  exist on such terms  still less a stranger to books  i respected the  voice of wisdom and experience in the first of moralists  and most  enlightened of men   footnote  dr johnson   and reading the letter of  cowley  i saw the vanity and absurdity of  panting after solitude     footnote  life of cowley  p          i sought not  therefore  a cell  but  since i purposed to live for  myself  i determined for myself also to think  servility of imitation  has ever been as much my scorn as servility of dependence  i resolved   therefore  to strike out something new  and no more to retire as every  other man had retired  than to linger in the world as every other man  had lingered      the result of all you now see  i found out this cottage  and took up  my abode in it  i am here out of the way of all society  yet avoid the  great evil of retreat   having nothing to do   i am constantly  not  capriciously employed  and the exercise which benefits my health   imperceptibly raises my spirits in despight of adversity  i am removed  from all temptation  i have scarce even the power to do wrong  i have no  object for ambition  for repining i have no time   i have  found out  i  repeat  the true secret of happiness  labour with independence      he stopt  and cecilia  who had listened to this narrative with a mixture  of compassion  admiration and censure  was too much struck with its  singularity to be readily able to answer it  her curiosity to hear him  had sprung wholly from her desire to assist him  and she had expected  from his story to gather some hint upon which her services might be  offered  but none had occurred  he professed himself fully satisfied  with his situation  and though reason and probability contradicted the  profession  she could not venture to dispute it with any delicacy or  prudence     she thanked him  therefore  for his relation  with many apologies for  the trouble she had given him  and added   i must not express my  concern for misfortunes which you seem to regard as conducive to your  contentment  nor remonstrate at the step you have taken  since you have  been led to it by choice  not necessity  but yet  you must pardon me if  i cannot help hoping i shall some time see you happier  according to the  common  however vulgar ideas of the rest of the world       no  never  never  i am sick of mankind  not from theory  but  experience  and the precautions i have taken against mental fatigue   will secure me from repentance  or any desire of change  for it is not  the active  but the indolent who weary  it is not the temperate  but the  pampered who are capricious       is your sister  sir  acquainted with this change in your fortune and  opinions       poor girl  no  she and her unhappy mother have borne but too long with  my enterprizes and misfortunes  even yet they would sacrifice whatever  they possess to enable me to play once more the game so often lost  but  i will not abuse their affection  nor suffer them again to be slaves to  my caprices  nor dupes to their own delusive expectations  i have sent  them word i am happy  i have not yet told them how or where  i fear much  the affliction of their disappointment  and  for a while  shall conceal  from them my situation  which they would fancy was disgraceful  and  grieve at as cruel       and is it not cruel   said cecilia   is labour indeed so sweet  and can  you seriously derive happiness from what all others consider as misery       not sweet   answered he   in itself  but sweet  most sweet and salutary  in its effects  when i work  i forget all the world  my projects for the  future  my disappointments from the past  mental fatigue is overpowered  by personal  i toil till i require rest  and that rest which nature   not luxury demands  leads not to idle meditation  but to sound  heavy   necessary sleep  i awake the next morning to the same thought exiling  business  work again till my powers are exhausted  and am relieved again  at night by the same health recruiting insensibility       and if this   cried cecilia   is the life of happiness  why have we so  many complaints of the sufferings of the poor  and why so eternally do  we hear of their hardships and distress       they have known no other life  they are strangers  therefore  to the  felicity of their lot  had they mingled in the world  fed high their  fancy with hope  and looked forward with expectation of enjoyment  had  they been courted by the great  and offered with profusion adulation  for their abilities  yet  even when starving  been offered nothing  else   had they seen an attentive circle wait all its entertainment from  their powers  yet found themselves forgotten as soon as out of sight   and perceived themselves avoided when no longer buffoons   oh had  they known and felt provocations such as these  how gladly would their  resentful spirits turn from the whole unfeeling race  and how would they  respect that noble and manly labour  which at once disentangles them  from such subjugating snares  and enables them to fly the ingratitude  they abhor  without the contrast of vice  virtue unloved may be lovely   without the experience of misery  happiness is simply a dull privation  of evil       and are you so content   cried cecilia   with your present situation   as even to think it offers you reparation for your past sufferings       content   repeated he with energy   o more than content  i am proud of  my present situation  i glory in chewing to the world  glory still more  in shewing to myself  that those whom i cannot but despise i will not  scruple to defy  and that where i have been treated unworthily  i will  scorn to be obliged       but will you pardon me   said cecilia   should i ask again  why in  quitting lord vannelt  you concluded no one else worthy a trial       because it was less my lord vannelt  madam  than my own situation  that  disgusted me  for though i liked not his behaviour  i found him a man  too generally esteemed to flatter myself better usage would await me  in merely changing my abode  while my station was the same  i believe   indeed  he never meant to offend me  but i was offended the more that  he should think me an object to receive indignity without knowing it  to  have had this pointed out to him  would have been at once mortifying and  vain  for delicacy  like taste  can only partially be taught  and will  always be superficial and erring where it is not innate  those wrongs   which though too trifling to resent  are too humiliating to be borne   speech can convey no idea of  the soul must feel  or the understanding  can never comprehend them       but surely   said cecilia   though people of refinement are rare  they  yet exist  why  then  remove yourself from the possibility of meeting  with them       must i run about the nation   cried he   proclaiming my distress  and  describing my temper  telling the world that though dependent i demand  respect as well as assistance  and publishing to mankind  that though  poor i will accept no gifts if offered with contumely  who will listen  to such an account  who will care for my misfortunes  but as they may  humble me to his service  who will hear my mortifications  but to say  i deserve them  what has the world to do with my feelings and  peculiarities  i know it too well to think calamity will soften it  i  need no new lessons to instruct me that to conquer affliction is more  wise than to relate it       unfortunate as you have been   said cecilia   i cannot wonder at your  asperity  but yet  it is surely no more than justice to acknowledge   that hard heartedness to distress is by no means the fault of the  present times  on the contrary  it is scarce sooner made known  than  every one is ready to contribute to its relief       and how contribute   cried he   by a paltry donation of money  yes  the  man whose only want is a few guineas  may  indeed  obtain them  but  he who asks kindness and protection  whose oppressed spirit calls for  consolation even more than his ruined fortune for repair  how is his  struggling soul  if superior to his fate  to brook the ostentation of  patronage  and the insolence of condescension  yes  yes  the world will  save the poor beggar who is starving  but the fallen wretch  who will  not cringe for his support  may consume in his own wretchedness without  pity and without help      cecilia now saw that the wound his sensibility had received was too  painful for argument  and too recent immediately to be healed  she  forbore  therefore  to detain him any longer  but expressing her best  wishes  without venturing to hint at her services  she arose  and they  all took their leave   belfield hastening  as they went  to return to  the garden  where  looking over the hedge as they passed  they saw him  employed again in weeding  with the eagerness of a man who pursues his  favourite occupation     cecilia half forgot her own anxieties and sadness  in the concern which  she felt for this unfortunate and extraordinary young man  she wished  much to devise some means for drawing him from a life of such hardship  and obscurity  but what to a man thus  jealous in honour   thus  scrupulous in delicacy  could she propose  without more risk of offence   than probability of obliging  his account had  indeed  convinced her how  much he stood in need of assistance  but it had shewn her no less how  fastidious he would be in receiving it     nor was she wholly without fear that an earnest solicitude to serve him   his youth  talents  and striking manners considered  might occasion even  in himself a misconstruction of her motives  such as she already had  given birth to in his forward and partial mother     the present  therefore  all circumstances weighed  seemed no season for  her liberality  which she yet resolved to exert the first moment it was  unopposed by propriety         chapter vi     a contest     the rest of the day was passed in discussing this adventure  but in the  evening  cecilia s interest in it was all sunk  by the reception of the  following letter from mrs delvile      to miss beverley      i grieve to interrupt the tranquillity of a retirement so judiciously  chosen  and i lament the necessity of again calling to trial the virtue  of which the exertion  though so captivating  is so painful  but alas   my excellent young friend  we came not hither to enjoy  but to suffer   and happy only are those whose sufferings have neither by folly  been sought  nor by guilt been merited  but arising merely from the  imperfection of humanity  have been resisted with fortitude  or endured  with patience     i am informed of your virtuous steadiness  which corresponds with my  expectations  while it excites my respect  all further conflict i had  hoped to have saved you  and to the triumph of your goodness i had  trusted for the recovery of your peace  but mortimer has disappointed  me  and our work is still unfinished     he avers that he is solemnly engaged to you  and in pleading to me his  honour  he silences both expostulation and authority  from your own  words alone will he acknowledge his dismission  and notwithstanding my  reluctance to impose upon you this task  i cannot silence or quiet him  without making the request     for a purpose such as this  can you  then  admit us  can you bear with  your own lips to confirm the irrevocable decision  you will feel  i am  sure  for the unfortunate mortimer  and it was earnestly my desire to  spare you the sight of his affliction  yet such is my confidence in your  prudence  that since i find him bent upon seeing you  i am not without  hope  that from witnessing the greatness of your mind  the interview may  rather calm than inflame him     this proposal you will take into consideration  and if you are able   upon such terms  to again meet my son  we will wait upon you together   where and when you will appoint  but if the gentleness of your nature  will make the effort too severe for you  scruple not to decline it  for  mortimer  when he knows your pleasure  will submit to it as he ought     adieu  most amiable and but too lovely cecilia  whatever you determine   be sure of my concurrence  for nobly have you earned  and ever must you  retain  the esteem  the affection  and the gratitude of augusta delvile      alas   cried cecilia   when shall i be at rest  when cease to be  persecuted by new conflicts  oh why must i so often  so cruelly  though  so reluctantly  reject and reprove the man who of all men i wish to  accept and to please      but yet  though repining at this hard necessity  she hesitated not a  moment in complying with mrs delvile s request  and immediately sent an  answer that she would meet her the next morning at mrs charlton s     she then returned to the parlour  and apologized to mrs harrel and  mr arnott for the abruptness of her visit  and the suddenness of her  departure  mr arnott heard her in silent dejection  and mrs harrel  used all the persuasion in her power to prevail with her to stay  her  presence being some relief to her solitude  but finding it ineffectual   she earnestly pressed her to hasten her entrance into her own house   that their absence might be shortened  and their meeting more sprightly     cecilia passed the night in planning her behaviour for the next day   she found how much was expected from her by mrs delvile  who had even  exhorted her to decline the interview if doubtful of her own strength   delvile s firmness in insisting the refusal should come directly  from herself  surprised  gratified and perplexed her in turn  she had  imagined  that from the moment of the discovery  he would implicitly  have submitted to the award of a parent at once so reverenced and so  beloved  and how he had summoned courage to contend with her she could  not conjecture  yet that courage and that contention astonished not  more than they soothed her  since  from her knowledge of his filial  tenderness  she considered them as the most indubitable proofs she had  yet received of the fervour and constancy of his regard for her  but  would he  when she had ratified the decision of his mother  forbear all  further struggle  and for ever yield up all pretensions to her  this was  the point upon which her uncertainty turned  and the ruling subject of  her thoughts and meditation     to be steady  however  herself  be his conduct what it might  was  invariably her intention  and was all her ambition  yet earnestly she  wished the meeting over  for she dreaded to see the sorrow of delvile   and she dreaded still more the susceptibility of her own heart     the next morning  to her great concern  mr arnott was waiting in the  hall when she came down stairs  and so much grieved at her departure   that he handed her to the chaise without being able to speak to her  and  hardly heard her thanks and compliments but by recollection after she  was gone     she arrived at mrs charlton s very early  and found her old friend in  the same state she had left her  she communicated to her the purpose of  her return  and begged she would keep her granddaughters up stairs  that  the conference in the parlour might be uninterrupted and unheard     she then made a forced and hasty breakfast  and went down to be ready  to receive them  they came not till eleven o clock  and the time of her  waiting was passed in agonies of expectation     at length they were announced  and at length they entered the room     cecilia  with her utmost efforts for courage  could hardly stand to  receive them  they came in together  but mrs delvile  advancing before  her son  and endeavouring so to stand as to intercept his view of her   with the hope that in a few instants her emotion would be less visible   said  in the most soothing accents   what honour miss beverley does us  by permitting this visit  i should have been sorry to have left suffolk  without the satisfaction of again seeing you  and my son  sensible of  the high respect he owes you  was most unwilling to be gone  before he  had paid you his devoirs      cecilia courtsied  but depressed by the cruel task which awaited her   had no power to speak  and mrs delvile  finding she still trembled  made  her sit down  and drew a chair next to her     mean while delvile  with an emotion far more violent  because wholly  unrestrained  waited impatiently till the ceremonial of the reception  was over  and then  approaching cecilia  in a voice of perturbation and  resentment  said   in this presence  at least  i hope i may be heard   though my letters have been unanswered  my visits refused  though  inexorably you have flown me        mortimer   interrupted mrs delvile   forget not that what i have told  you is irrevocable  you now meet miss beverley for no other purpose than  to give and to receive a mutual release of all to or engagement with  each other       pardon me  madam   cried he   this is a condition to which i have never  assented  i come not to release  but to claim her  i am hers  and hers  wholly  i protest it in the face of the world  the time  therefore  is  now past for the sacrifice which you demand  since scarce are you more  my mother  than i consider her as my wife      cecilia  amazed at this dauntless declaration  now almost lost her fear  in her surprise  while mrs delvile  with an air calm though displeased   answered   this is not a point to be at present discussed  and i had  hoped you knew better what was due to your auditors  i only consented to  this interview as a mark of your respect for miss beverley  to whom in  propriety it belongs to break off this unfortunate connexion      cecilia  who at this call could no longer be silent  now gathered  fortitude to say   whatever tie or obligation may be supposed to depend  upon me  i have already relinquished  and i am now ready to declare        that you wholly give me up   interrupted delvile   is that what you  would say   oh how have i offended you  how have i merited a displeasure  that can draw upon me such a sentence   answer  speak to me  cecilia   what is it i have done       nothing  sir   said cecilia  confounded at this language in the  presence of his mother   you have done nothing   but yet        yet what   have you conceived to me an aversion  has any dreadful and  horrible antipathy succeeded to your esteem   tell  tell me without  disguise  do you hate  do you abhor me      cecilia sighed  and turned away her head  and mrs delvile indignantly  exclaimed   what madness and absurdity  i scarce know you under the  influence of such irrational violence  why will you interrupt miss  beverley in the only speech you ought to hear from her  why  at once   oppress her  and irritate me  by words of more passion than reason   go on  charming girl  finish what so wisely  so judiciously you  were beginning  and then you shall be released from this turbulent  persecution       no  madam  she must not go on   cried delvile   if she does not utterly  abhor me  i will not suffer her to go on   pardon  pardon me  cecilia   but your too exquisite delicacy is betraying not only my happiness  but  your own  once more  therefore  i conjure you to hear me  and then if   deliberately and unbiassed  you renounce me  i will never more distress  you by resisting your decree      cecilia  abashed and changing colour  was silent  and he proceeded      all that has past between us  the vows i have offered you of faith   constancy and affection  the consent i obtained from you to be legally  mine  the bond of settlement i have had drawn up  and the high honour  you conferred upon me in suffering me to lead you to the altar   all  these particulars are already known to so many  that the least  reflection must convince you they will soon be concealed from none  tell  me  then  if your own fame pleads not for me  and if the scruples which  lead you to refuse  by taking another direction  will not  with much  more propriety  urge  nay enjoin you to accept me   you hesitate at  least   o miss beverley   i see in that hesitation        nothing  nothing   cried she  hastily  and checking her rising  irresolution   there is nothing for you to see  but that every way i now  turn i have rendered myself miserable       mortimer   said mrs delvile  seized with terror as she penetrated into  the mental yielding of cecilia   you have now spoken to miss beverley   and unwilling as i am to obtrude upon her our difference of sentiment   it is necessary  since she has heard you  that i  also  should claim her  attention       first let her speak   cried delvile  who in her apparent wavering built  new hopes   first let her answer what she has already deigned to listen  to       no  first let her hear   cried mrs delvile   for so only can she judge  what answer will reflect upon her most honour      then  solemnly turning to cecilia  she continued   you see here  miss  beverley  a young man who passionately adores you  and who forgets in  his adoration friends  family  and connections  the opinions in which  he has been educated  the honour of his house  his own former views   and all his primitive sense of duty  both public and private   a passion  built on such a defalcation of principle renders him unworthy your  acceptance  and not more ignoble for him would be a union which would  blot his name from the injured stock whence he sprung  than indelicate  for you  who upon such terms ought to despise him       heavens  madam   exclaimed delvile   what a speech       o never   cried cecilia  rising   may i hear such another  indeed   madam  there is no occasion to probe me so deeply  for i would not now  enter your family  for all that the whole world could offer me       at length  then  madam   cried delvile  turning reproachfully to his  mother   are you satisfied  is your purpose now answered  and is the  dagger you have transfixed in my heart sunk deep enough to appease you       o could i draw it out   cried mrs delvile   and leave upon it no stain  of ignominy  with what joy should my own bosom receive it  to heal the  wound i have most compulsatorily inflicted   were this excellent young  creature portionless  i would not hesitate in giving my consent  every  claim of interest would be overbalanced by her virtues  and i would not  grieve to see you poor  where so conscious you were happy  but here to  concede  would annihilate every hope with which hitherto i have looked  up to my son       let us now  then  madam   said cecilia   break up this conference  i  have spoken  i have heard  the decree is past  and therefore         you are indeed an angel   cried mrs delvile  rising and embracing her    and never can i reproach my son with what has passed  when i consider  for what an object the sacrifice was planned   you  cannot be unhappy   you have purchased peace by the exercise of virtue  and the close of  every day will bring to you a reward  in the sweets of a self approving  mind   but we will part  since you think it right  i do wrong to  occasion any delay       no  we will  not  part   cried delvile  with encreasing vehemence   if  you force me  madam  from her  you will drive me to distraction  what is  there in this world that can offer me a recompense  and what can pride  even to the proudest afford as an equivalent  her perfections you  acknowledge  her greatness of mind is like your own  she has generously  given me her heart   oh sacred and fascinating charge  shall i  after  such a deposite  consent to an eternal separation  repeal  repeal your  sentence  my cecilia  let us live to ourselves and our consciences  and  leave the vain prejudices of the world to those who can be paid by them  for the loss of all besides       is this conflict  then   said mrs delvile   to last for ever  oh  end it  mortimer  finish it  and make me happy  she is just  and will  forgive you  she is noble minded  and will honour you  fly  then  at  this critical moment  for in flight alone is your safety  and then will  your father see the son of his hopes  and then shall the fond blessings  of your idolizing mother soothe all your affliction  and soften all your  regret       oh madam   cried delvile   for mercy  for humanity  forbear this cruel  supplication       nay  more than supplication  you have my commands  commands you have  never yet disputed  and misery  ten fold misery  will follow their  disobedience  hear me  mortimer  for i speak prophetically  i know your  heart  i know it to be formed for rectitude and duty  or destined by  their neglect to repentance and horror      delvile  struck by these words  turned suddenly from them both  and  in gloomy despondence walked to the other end of the room  mrs delvile  perceived the moment of her power  and determined to pursue the blow   taking  therefore  the hand of cecilia  while her eyes sparkled with the  animation of reviving hope   see   she cried  pointing to her son   see  if i am deceived  can he bear even the suggestion of future contrition   think you when it falls upon him  he will support it better  no  he  will sink under it  and you  pure as you are of mind  and steadfast in  principle  what would your chance be of happiness with a man who never  erring till he knew you  could never look at you without regret  be his  fondness what it might       oh madam   cried the greatly shocked cecilia   let him  then  see me no  more   take  take him all to yourself  forgive  console him  i will not  have the misery of involving him in repentance  nor of incurring the  reproaches of the mother he so much reverences       exalted creature   cried mrs delvile   tenderness such as this would  confer honour upon a monarch   then  calling out exultingly to her  son   see   she added   how great a woman can act  when stimulated by  generosity  and a just sense of duty  follow then  at least  the example  you ought to have led  and deserve my esteem and love  or be content to  forego them       and can i only deserve them   said delvile  in a tone of the deepest  anguish   by a compliance to which not merely my happiness  but  my reason must be sacrificed  what honour do i injure that is not  factitious  what evil threatens our union  that is not imaginary  in  the general commerce of the world it may be right to yield to its  prejudices  but in matters of serious importance  it is weakness to be  shackled by scruples so frivolous  and it is cowardly to be governed by  the customs we condemn  religion and the laws of our country should then  alone be consulted  and where those are neither opposed nor infringed   we should hold ourselves superior to all other considerations       mistaken notions   said mrs delvile   and how long do you flatter  yourself this independent happiness would endure  how long could you  live contented by mere self gratification  in defiance of the censure  of mankind  the renunciation of your family  and the curses of your  father       the curses of my father   repeated he  starting and shuddering   o no   he could never be so barbarous       he could   said she  steadily   nor do i doubt but he would  if now   however  you are affected by the prospect of his disclaiming you  think  but what you will feel when first forbid to appear before either of us   and think of your remorse for involving miss beverley in such disgrace       o speak not such words   cried he  with agonizing earnestness   to  disgrace her   to be banished by you   present not  i conjure you  such  scenes to my imagination       yet would they be unavoidable   continued she   nor have i said to you  all  blinded as you now are by passion  your nobler feelings are only  obscured  not extirpated  think  then  how they will all rise in revenge  of your insulted dignity  when your name becomes a stranger to your  ears  and you are first saluted by one so meanly adopted         hold  hold  madam   interrupted he   this is more than i can bear       heavens   still continued she  disregarding his entreaty   what in the  universe can pay you for that first moment of indignity  think of it  well ere you proceed  and anticipate your sensations  lest the shock  should wholly overcome you  how will the blood of your wronged ancestors  rise into your guilty cheeks  and how will your heart throb with secret  shame and reproach  when wished joy upon your marriage by the name of   mr beverley       delvile  stung to the soul  attempted not any answer  but walked about  the room in the utmost disorder of mind  cecilia would have retired   but feared irritating him to some extravagance  and mrs delvile  looking  after him  added  for myself  i would still see  for i should pity  your wife   but never would i behold my son when sunk into an object of  compassion       it shall not be   cried he  in a transport of rage   cease  cease to  distract me   be content  madam   you have conquered       then you are my son   cried she  rapturously embracing him   now i know  again my mortimer  now i see the fair promise of his upright youth  and  the flattering completion of my maternal expectations      cecilia  finding all thus concluded  desired nothing so much as to  congratulate them on their reconciliation  but having only said  let   me   too     her voice failed her  she stopt short  and hoping she had  been unheard  would have glided out of the room     but delvile  penetrated and tortured  yet delighted at this sensibility   broke from his mother  and seizing her hand  exclaimed   oh miss  beverley  if  you  are not happy         i am  i am   cried she  with quickness   let me pass   and think no  more of me       that voice   those looks     cried he  still holding her   they speak  not serenity   oh if i have injured your peace   if that heart  which   pure as angels  deserves to be as sacred from sorrow  through my means   or for my sake  suffers any diminution of tranquility        none  none   interrupted she  with precipitation      i know well   cried he   your greatness of soul  and if this dreadful  sacrifice gives lasting torture only to myself   if of  your  returning  happiness i could be assured   i would struggle to bear it       you  may   be assured of it   cried she  with reviving dignity   i have  no right to expect escaping all calamity  but while i share the common  lot  i will submit to it without repining       heaven then bless  and hovering angels watch you   cried he  and  letting go her hand  he ran hastily out of the room      oh virtue  how bright is thy triumph   exclaimed mrs delvile  flying  up to cecilia  and folding her in her arms   noble  incomparable young  creature  i knew not that so much worth was compatible with human  frailty      but the heroism of cecilia  in losing its object  lost its force  she  sighed  she could not speak  tears gushed into her eyes  and kissing mrs  delvile s hand with a look that shewed her inability to converse with  her  she hastened  though scarce able to support herself  away  with  intention to shut herself up in her own apartment  and mrs delvile   who perceived that her utmost fortitude was exhausted  opposed not her  going  and wisely forbore to encrease her emotion  by following her even  with her blessings     but when she came into the hall  she started  and could proceed no  further  for there she beheld delvile  who in too great agony to be  seen  had stopt to recover some composure before he quitted the house     at the first sound of an opening door  he was hastily escaping  but  perceiving cecilia  and discerning her situation  he more hastily turned  back  saying   is it possible   to  me  were you coming      she shook her head  and made a motion with her hand to say no  and would  then have gone on      you are weeping   cried he   you are pale   oh miss beverley  is this  your happiness       i am very well     cried she  not knowing what she answered   i am  quite well   pray go   i am very    her words died away inarticulated      o what a voice is that   exclaimed he   it pierces my very soul      mrs delvile now came to the parlour door  and looked aghast at the  situation in which she saw them  cecilia again moved on  and reached the  stairs  but tottered  and was obliged to cling to the banisters      o suffer me to support you   cried he   you are not able to  stand   whither is it you would go       any where   i don t know     answered she  in faltering accents   but  if you would leave me  i should be well      and  turning from him  she walked again towards the parlour  finding by  her shaking frame  the impossibility of getting unaided up the stairs      give me your hand  my love   said mrs delvile  cruelly alarmed by this  return  and the moment they re entered the parlour  she said impatiently  to her son   mortimer  why are you not gone      he heard her not  however  his whole attention was upon cecilia  who   sinking into a chair  hid her face against mrs delvile  but  reviving in  a few moments  and blushing at the weakness she had betrayed  she raised  her head  and  with an assumed serenity  said   i am better   much  better   i was rather sick   but it is over  and now  if you will excuse  me  i will go to my own room      she then arose  but her knees trembled  and her head was giddy  and  again seating herself  she forced a faint smile  and said   perhaps i  had better keep quiet       can i bear this   cried delvile   no  it shakes all my  resolution   loveliest and most beloved cecilia  forgive my rash  declaration  which i hear retract and forswear  and which no false  pride  no worthless vanity shall again surprise from me   raise  then   your eyes        hot headed young man   interrupted mrs delvile  with an air of haughty  displeasure   if you cannot be rational  at least be silent  miss  beverley  we will both leave him      shame  and her own earnestness  how restored some strength to cecilia   who read with terror in the looks of mrs delvile the passions with which  she was agitated  and instantly obeyed her by rising  but her son  who  inherited a portion of her own spirit  rushed between them both and the  door  and exclaimed   stay  madam  stay  i cannot let you go  i see your  intention  i see your dreadful purpose  you will work upon the feelings  of miss beverley  you will extort from her a promise to see me no more       oppose not my passing   cried mrs delvile  whose voice  face and manner  spoke the encreasing disturbance of her soul   i have but too long  talked to you in vain  i must now take some better method for the  security of the honour of my family      this moment appeared to delvile decisive  and casting off in desperation  all timidity and restraint  he suddenly sprang forward  and snatching  the hand of cecilia from his mother  he exclaimed   i cannot  i will not  give her up   nor now  madam  nor ever   i protest it most solemnly  i  affirm it by my best hopes  i swear it by all that i hold sacred      grief and horror next to frenzy at a disappointment thus unexpected  and  thus peremptory  rose in the face of mrs delvile  who  striking her hand  upon her forehead  cried   my brain is on fire   and rushed out of the  room     cecilia had now no difficulty to disengage herself from delvile  who   shocked at the exclamation  and confounded by the sudden departure of  his mother  hastened eagerly to pursue her  she had only flown into the  next parlour  but  upon following her thither  what was his dread and  his alarm  when he saw her extended  upon the floor  her face  hands and  neck all covered with blood   great heaven   he exclaimed  prostrating  himself by her side   what is it you have done   where are you  wounded   what direful curse have you denounced against your son      not able to speak  she angrily shook her head  and indignantly made a  motion with her hand  that commanded him from her sight     cecilia  who had followed  though half dead with terror  had yet the  presence of mind to ring the bell  a servant came immediately  and  delvile  starting up from his mother  ordered him to fetch the first  surgeon or physician he could find     the alarm now brought the rest of the servants into the room  and mrs  delvile suffered herself to be raised from the ground  and seated in a  chair  she was still silent  but shewed a disgust to any assistance  from her son  that made him deliver her into the hands of the servants   while  in speechless agony  he only looked on and watched her     neither did cecilia  though forgetting her own sorrow  and no longer  sensible of personal weakness  venture to approach her  uncertain what  had happened  she yet considered herself as the ultimate cause of this  dreadful scene  and feared to risk the effect of the smallest additional  emotion     the servant returned with a surgeon in a few minutes  cecilia  unable  to wait and hear what he would say  glided hastily out of the room  and  delvile  in still greater agitation  followed her quick into the  next parlour  but having eagerly advanced to speak to her  he turned  precipitately about  and hurrying into the hall  walked in hasty steps  up and down it  without courage to enquire what was passing     at length the surgeon came out  delvile flew to him  and stopt him   but could ask no question  his countenance  however  rendered words  unnecessary  the surgeon understood him  and said   the lady will do  very well  she has burst a blood vessel  but i think it will be of  no consequence  she must be kept quiet and easy  and upon no account  suffered to talk  or to use any exertion      delvile now let him go  and flew himself into a corner to return thanks  to heaven that the evil  however great  was less than he had at first  apprehended  he then went into the parlour to cecilia  eagerly calling  out   heaven be praised  my mother has not voluntarily cursed me       o now then   cried cecilia   once more make her bless you  the violence  of her agitation has already almost destroyed her  and her frame is too  weak for this struggle of contending passions   go to her  then  and  calm the tumult of her spirits  by acquiescing wholly in her will  and  being to her again the son she thinks she has lost       alas   said he  in a tone of the deepest dejection   i have been  preparing myself for that purpose  and waited but your commands to  finally determine me       let us both go to her instantly   said cecilia   the least delay may be  fatal      she now led the way  and approaching mrs delvile  who  faint and weak   was seated upon an arm chair  and resting her head upon the shoulder of  a maid servant  said   lean  dearest madam  upon  me   and speak not   but hear us      she then took the place of the maid  and desired her and the other  servants to go out of the room  delvile advanced  but his mother s eye   recovering  at his sight  its wonted fire  darted upon him a glance of  such displeasure  that  shuddering with the apprehension of inflaming  again those passions which threatened her destruction  he hastily sank  on one knee  and abruptly exclaimed   look at me with less abhorrence   for i come but to resign myself to your will       mine  also   cried cecilia   that will shall be  you need not speak  it  we know it  and here solemnly we promise that we will separate for  ever       revive  then  my mother   said delvile   rely upon our plighted  honours  and think only of your health  for your son will never more  offend you      mrs delvile  much surprised  and strongly affected  held out her hand to  him  with a look of mingled compassion and obligation  and dropping  her head upon the bosom of cecilia  who with her other arm she pressed  towards her  she burst into an agony of tears      go  go  sir   said cecilia  cruelly alarmed   you have said all that is  necessary  leave mrs delvile now  and she will be more composed      delvile instantly obeyed  and then his mother  whose mouth still  continued to fill with blood  though it gushed not from her with the  violence it had begun  was prevailed upon by the prayers of cecilia to  consent to be conveyed into her room  and  as her immediate removal  to another house might be dangerous  she complied also  though very  reluctantly  with her urgent entreaties  that she would take entire  possession of it till the next day     this point gained  cecilia left her  to communicate what had passed to  mrs charlton  but was told by one of the servants that mr delvile begged  first to speak with her in the next room     she hesitated for a moment whether to grant this request  but  recollecting it was right to acquaint him with his mother s intention of  staying all night  she went to him      how indulgent you are   cried he  in a melancholy voice  as she opened  the door   i am now going post to dr lyster  whom i shall entreat to  come hither instantly  but i am fearful of again disturbing my mother   and must therefore rely upon you to acquaint her what is become of me       most certainly  i have begged her to remain here to night  and i hope  i shall prevail with her to continue with me till dr lyster s arrival   after which she will  doubtless  be guided either in staying longer  or  removing elsewhere  by his advice       you are all goodness   said he  with a deep sigh   and how i shall  support  but i mean not to return hither  at least not to this  house   unless  indeed  dr lyster s account should be alarming  i leave  my mother  therefore  to your kindness  and only hope  only entreat   that your own health   your own peace of mind  neither by attendance  upon her  by anxiety  by pity for her son       he stopt  and seemed gasping for breath  cecilia turned from him to hide  her emotion  and he proceeded with a rapidity of speech that shewed his  terror of continuing with her any longer  and his struggle with himself  to be gone   the promise you have made in both our names to my mother   i shall hold myself bound to observe  i see  indeed  that her reason  or her life would fall the sacrifice of further opposition  of myself   therefore  it is no longer time to think   i take of you no leave  i  cannot  yet i would fain tell you the high reverence  but it is better  to say nothing        much better   cried cecilia  with a forced and faint smile   lose not   therefore  an instant  but hasten to this good dr lyster       i will   answered he  going to the door  but there  stopping and  turning round   one thing i should yet   he added   wish to say   i have  been impetuous  violent  unreasonable   with shame and with regret i  recollect how impetuous  and how unreasonable  i have persecuted  where  i ought in silence to have submitted  i have reproached  where i ought  in candour to have approved  and in the vehemence with which i have  pursued you  i have censured that very dignity of conduct which has  been the basis of my admiration  my esteem  my devotion  but never can  i forget  and never without fresh wonder remember  the sweetness with  which you have borne with me  even when most i offended you  for this  impatience  this violence  this inconsistency  i now most sincerely  beg your pardon  and if  before i go  you could so far condescend as to  pronounce my forgiveness  with a lighter heart  i think  i should quit  you       do not talk of forgiveness   said cecilia   you have never offended me   i always knew  always was sure  always imputed    she stopt  unable to  proceed     deeply penetrated by her apparent distress  he with difficulty  restrained himself from falling at her feet  but after a moment s pause  and recollection  he said   i understand the generous indulgence you  have shewn me  an indulgence i shall ever revere  and ever grieve to  have abused  i ask you not to remember me   far  far happier do i wish  you than such a remembrance could make you  but i will pain the  humanity of your disposition no longer  you will tell my mother  but  no matter   heaven preserve you  my angelic cecilia   miss beverley   i mean  heaven guide  protect  and bless you  and should i see you no  more  should this be the last sad moment        he paused  but presently recovering himself  added   may i hear  at  least  of your tranquillity  for that alone can have any chance to quiet  or repress the anguish i feel here      he then abruptly retreated  and ran out of the house     cecilia for a while remained almost stupified with sorrow  she forgot  mrs delvile  she forgot mrs charlton  she forgot her own design of  apologizing to one  or assisting the other  she continued in the posture  in which he had left her  quite without motion  and almost without  sensibility         chapter vii     a message     from this lethargy of sadness cecilia was soon  however  awakened by the  return of the surgeon  who had brought with him a physician to consult  upon mrs delvile s situation  terror for the mother once more drove  the son from her thoughts  and she waited with the most apprehensive  impatience to hear the result of the consultation  the physician  declined giving any positive opinion  but  having written a  prescription  only repeated the injunction of the surgeon  that she  should be kept extremely quiet  and on no account be suffered to talk     cecilia  though shocked and frightened at the occasion  was yet by no  means sorry at an order which thus precluded all conversation  unfitted  for it by her own misery  she was glad to be relieved from all necessity  of imposing upon herself the irksome task of finding subjects for  discourse to which she was wholly indifferent  while obliged with  sedulity to avoid those by which alone her mind was occupied     the worthy mrs charlton heard the events of the morning with the utmost  concern  but charged her grand daughters to assist her young friend in  doing the honours of her house to mrs delvile  while she ordered another  apartment to be prepared for cecilia  to whom she administered all the  consolation her friendly zeal could suggest     cecilia  however unhappy  had too just a way of thinking to indulge in  selfish grief  where occasion called her to action for the benefit  of others  scarce a moment  therefore now did she allow to sorrow and  herself  but assiduously bestowed the whole of her time upon her two  sick friends  dividing her attention according to their own desire or  convenience  without consulting or regarding any choice of her own   choice  indeed  she had none  she loved mrs charlton  she revered mrs  delvile  the warmest wish with which her heart glowed  was the recovery  of both  but too deep was her affliction to receive pleasure from  either     two days passed thus  during which the constancy of her attendance   which at another time would have fatigued her  proved the only relief  she was capable of receiving  mrs delvile was evidently affected by her  vigilant tenderness  but seemed equally desirous with herself to make  use of the prohibition to speech as an excuse for uninterrupted silence   she enquired not even after her son  though the eagerness of her look  towards the door whenever it was opened  shewed either a hope  or an  apprehension that he might enter  cecilia wished to tell her whither  he was gone  but dreaded trusting her voice with his name  and their  silence  after a while  seemed so much by mutual consent  that she had  soon as little courage as she had inclination to break it     the arrival of dr lyster gave her much satisfaction  for upon him  rested her hopes of mrs delvile s re establishment  he sent for her down  stairs  to enquire whether he was expected  and hearing that he was not   desired her to announce him  as the smallest emotion might do mischief     she returned up stairs  and after a short preparation  said   your  favourite dr lyster  madam  is come  and i shall be much the happier for  having you under his care       dr lyster   cried she   who sent for him       i believe  i fancy  mr delvile fetched him       my son   is he here  then       no   he went  the moment he left you  for dr lyster   and dr lyster is  come by himself       does he write to you       no  indeed   he writes not  he comes not  dearest madam be satisfied   he will do neither to me ever more       exemplary young man   cried she  in a voice hardly audible   how great  is his loss   unhappy mortimer   ill fated  and ill rewarded      she sighed  and said no more  but this short conversation  the only one  which had passed between them since her illness  agitated her so  much  that dr lyster  who now came up stairs  found her in a state of  trembling and weakness that both alarmed and surprised him  cecilia   glad of an opportunity to be gone  left the room  and sent  by dr  lyster s desire  for the physician and surgeon who had already attended     after they had been some time with their patient  they retired to a  consultation  and when it was over  dr lyster waited upon cecilia in  the parlour  and assured her he had no apprehension of danger for  mrs delvile   though  for another week   he added   i would have her  continue your  patient   as she is not yet fit to be removed  but pray  mind that she is kept quiet  let nobody go near her  not even her own  son  by the way he is waiting for me at the inn  so i ll just speak  again to his mother  and be gone      cecilia was well pleased by this accidental information  to learn  both the anxiety of delvile for his mother  and the steadiness of his  forbearance for himself  when dr lyster came down stairs again   i shall  stay   he said   till to morrow  but i hope she will be able in another  week to get to bristol  in the mean time i shall leave her  i see  with  an excellent nurse  but  my good young lady  in your care of her  don t  neglect yourself  i am not quite pleased with your looks  though it is  but an old fashioned speech to tell you so   what have you been doing to  yourself       nothing   said she  a little embarrassed   but had you not better have  some tea       why yes  i think i had   but what shall i do with my young man      cecilia understood the hint  but coloured  and made no answer      he is waiting for me   he continued   at the inn  however  i never yet  knew the young man i would prefer to a young woman  so if you will give  me some tea here  i shall certainly jilt him      cecilia instantly rang the bell  and ordered tea      well now   said he   remember the sin of this breach of appointment  lies wholly at your door  i shall tell him you laid violent hands on  me  and if that is not  enough to excuse me  i shall desire he will try  whether he could be more of a stoic with you himself       i think i must unorder the tea   said she  with what gaiety she could  assume   if i am to be responsible for any mischief from your drinking  it       no  no  you shan t be off now  but pray would it be quite out of rule  for you to send and ask him to come to us       why i believe  i think    said she  stammering   it s very likely he  may be engaged       well  well  i don t mean to propose any violent incongruity  you must  excuse my blundering  i understand but little of the etiquette of young  ladies   tis a science too intricate to be learned without more study  than we plodding men of business can well spare time for  however  when  i have done  writing  prescriptions  i will set about  reading  them   provided you will be my instructress      cecilia  though ashamed of a charge in which prudery and affectation  were implied  was compelled to submit to it  as either to send for  delvile  or explain her objections  was equally impossible  the miss  charltons  therefore  joined them  and they went to tea     just as they had done  a note was delivered to dr lyster   see here    cried he  when he had read it   what a fine thing it is to be a  young   man  why now  mr mortimer understands as much of all this  etiquette  as  you ladies do yourselves  for he only writes a note even to ask how his  mother does      he then put it into cecilia s hand      to dr lyster      tell me  my dear sir  how you have found my mother  i am uneasy at  your long stay  and engaged with my friend biddulph  or i should have  followed you in person     m d      so you see   continued the doctor   i need not do penance for  engaging myself to you  when this young gentleman can find such good  entertainment for himself      cecilia who well knew the honourable motive of delvile s engagement   with difficulty forbore speaking in his vindication  dr lyster  immediately began an answer  but before he had finished it  called out    now as i am told you are a very good young woman  i think you can do no  less than assist me to punish this gay spark  for playing the macaroni   when he ought to visit his sick mother      cecilia  much hurt for delvile  and much confused for herself  looked  abashed  but knew not what to answer      my scheme   continued the doctor   is to tell him  that as he has found  one engagement for tea  he may find another for supper  but that as to  me  i am better disposed of  for you insist upon keeping me to yourself   come  what says  etiquette   may i treat myself with this puff       certainly   said cecilia  endeavouring to look pleased   if you will  favour us with your company  miss charltons and myself will think the   puffing  should rather be ours than yours       that  then   said the doctor   will not answer my purpose  for i mean  the puff to be my own  or how do i punish him  so  suppose i tell him  i shall not only sup with three young ladies  but be invited to a   tete a tete  with one of them into the bargain      the young ladies only laughed  and the doctor finished his note  and  sent it away  and then  turning gaily to cecilia   come   he said   why  don t you give me this invitation  surely you don t mean to make me  guilty of perjury      cecilia  but little disposed for pleasantry  would gladly now have dropt  the subject  but dr lyster  turning to the miss charltons  said   young  ladies  i call you both to witness if this is not very bad usage  this  young woman has connived at my writing a downright falsehood  and all  the time took me in to believe it was a truth  the only way i can think  of to cure her of such frolics  is for both of you to leave us together   and so make her keep her word whether she will or no      the miss charltons took the hint  and went away  while cecilia  who  had not at all suspected he meant seriously to speak with her  remained  extremely perplexed to think what he had to say      mrs delvile   cried he  continuing the same air of easy good humour    though i allowed her not to speak to me above twenty words  took up  near ten of them to tell me that you had behaved to her like an angel   why so she ought  cried i  what else was she sent for here to look  so like one  i charged her  therefore  to take all that as a thing of  course  and to prove that i really think what i say  i am now going to  make a trial of you  that  if you are any thing less  will induce you to  order some of your men to drive me into the street  the truth is  i have  had a little commission given me  which in the first place i know not  how to introduce  and which  in the second  as far as i can judge   appears to be absolutely superfluous      cecilia now felt uneasy and alarmed  and begged him to explain himself   he then dropt the levity with which he had begun the discourse  and  after a grave  yet gentle preparation  expressive of his unwillingness  to distress her  and his firm persuasion of her uncommon worthiness  he  acquainted her that he was no stranger to her situation with respect to  the delvile family      good god   cried she  blushing and much amazed   and who         i knew it   said he   from the moment i attended mr mortimer in his  illness at delvile castle  he could not conceal from me that the seat  of his disorder was his mind  and i could not know that  without readily  conjecturing the cause  when i saw who was his father s guest  and when  i knew what was his father s character  he found he was betrayed to me   and upon my advising a journey  he understood me properly  his openness  to counsel  and the manly firmness with which he behaved in quitting  you  made me hope the danger was blown over  but last week  when i was  at the castle  where i have for some time attended mr delvile  who has  had a severe fit of the gout  i found him in an agitation of spirits  that made me apprehend it would be thrown into his stomach  i desired  mrs delvile to use her influence to calm him  but she was herself in  still greater emotion  and acquainting me she was obliged to leave  him  desired i would spend with him every moment in my power  i have  therefore almost lived at the castle during her absence  and  in  the course of our many conversations  he has acknowledged to me the  uneasiness under which he has laboured  from the intelligence concerning  his son  which he had just received      cecilia wished here to enquire  how  received  and from whom  but had  not the courage  and therefore he proceeded      i was still with the father when mr mortimer arrived post at my house  to fetch me hither  i was sent for home  he informed me of his errand  without disguise  for he knew i was well acquainted with the original  secret whence all the evil arose  i told him my distress in what  manner to leave his father  and he was extremely shocked himself when  acquainted with his situation  we agreed that it would be vain to  conceal from him the indisposition of mrs delvile  which the delay of  her return  and a thousand other accidents  might in some unfortunate  way make known to him  he commissioned me  therefore  to break it to  him  that he might consent to my journey  and at the same time to quiet  his own mind  by assuring him all he had apprehended was wholly at an  end      he stopt  and looked to see how cecilia bore these words      it is all at an end  sir   said she  with firmness   but i have not yet  heard your commission  what  and from whom is that       i am thoroughly satisfied it is unnecessary   he answered   since the  young man can but submit  and you can but give him up       but still  if there is a message  it is fit i should hear it       if you chase it  so it is  i told mr delvile whither i was coming   and i repeated to him his son s assurances  he was relieved  but not  satisfied  he would not see him  and gave me for him a prohibition of  extreme severity  and to  you  he bid me say        from  him   then  is my message   cried cecilia  half frightened  and  much disappointed      yes   said he  understanding her immediately   for the son  after  giving me his first account  had the wisdom and forbearance not once to  mention you       i am very glad   said she  with a mixture of admiration and regret   to  hear it  but  what  sir  said mr delvile       he bid me tell you that either  he   or  you  must see his son never  more       it was indeed unnecessary   cried she  colouring with resentment   to  send me such a message  i meant not to see him again  he meant not to  desire it  i return him  however  no answer  and i will make him no  promise  to mrs delvile alone i hold myself bound  to him  send what  messages he may  i shall always hold myself free  but believe me  dr  lyster  if with his name  his son had inherited his character  his  desire of our separation would be feeble  and trifling  compared with my  own       i am sorry  my good young lady   said he   to have given you this  disturbance  yet i admire your spirit  and doubt not but it will enable  you to forget any little disappointment you may have suffered  and what   after all  have you to regret  mortimer delvile is  indeed  a young man  that any woman might wish to attach  but every woman cannot have him   and you  of all women  have least reason to repine in missing him   for scarcely is there another man you may not chuse or reject at your  pleasure      little as was the consolation cecilia could draw from this speech   she was sensible it became not her situation to make complaints  and  therefore  to end the conversation she proposed calling in the miss  charltons      no  no   said he   i must step up again to mrs delvile  and then  be gone  to morrow morning i shall but call to see how she is  and leave  some directions  and set off  mr mortimer delvile accompanies me back   but he means to return hither in a week  in order to travel with his  mother to bristol  mean time  i purpose to bring about a reconciliation  between him and his father  whose prejudices are more intractable than  any man s i ever met with       it will be strange indeed   said cecilia   should a reconciliation   now  be difficult       true  but it is long since he was young himself  and the softer  affections he never was acquainted with  and only regards them in his  son as derogatory to his whole race  however  if there were not some few  such men  there would hardly be a family in the kingdom that could count  a great grand father  i am not  i must own  of his humour myself  but  i think it rather peculiarly stranger  than peculiarly worse than most  other peoples  and how  for example  was that of  your  uncle a whit the  better  he was just as fond of  his  name  as if  like mr delvile  he  could trace it from the time of the saxons      cecilia strongly felt the truth of this observation  but not chusing to  discuss it  made not any answer  and dr lyster  after a few good natured  apologies  both for his friends the delviles and himself  went up  stairs      what continual disturbance   cried she  when left alone   keeps me  thus for ever from rest  no sooner is one wound closed  but another is  opened  mortification constantly succeeds distress  and when my heart is  spared  my pride is attacked  that not a moment of tranquility may ever  be allowed me  had the lowest of women won the affections of mr delvile   could his father with less delicacy or less decency have acquainted her  with his inflexible disapprobation  to send with so little ceremony a  message so contemptuous and so peremptory   but perhaps it is better   for had he  too  like mrs delvile  joined kindness with rejection  i  might still more keenly have felt the perverseness of my destiny          chapter vii     a parting     the next morning dr lyster called early  and having visited mrs delvile   and again met the two gentlemen of the faculty in whose care she was to  remain  he took his leave  but not without contriving first to speak a  few words to cecilia in private  in which he charged her to be careful  of her health  and re animate her spirits   don t suppose   said he    that because i am a friend of the delvile family  i am either blind to  your merits  or to their foibles  far from it  but then why should  they interfere with one another  let them keep their prejudices  which   though different  are not worse than their neighbours  and do you retain  your excellencies  and draw from them the happiness they ought to give  you  people reason and refine themselves into a thousand miseries  by  chusing to settle that they can only be contented one way  whereas   there are fifty ways  if they would but look about them  that would  commonly do as well       i believe  indeed  you are right   answered cecilia   and i thank you  for the admonition  i will do what i can towards studying your scheme of  philosophy  and it is always one step to amendment  to be convinced that  we want it       you are a sensible and charming girl   said dr lyster   and mr delvile   should he find a daughter in law descended in a right line from egbert   first king of all england  won t be so well off as if he had satisfied  himself with you  however  the old gentleman has a fair right  after  all  to be pleased his own way  and let us blame him how we will  we  shall find  upon sifting  it is for no other reason but because his  humour happens to clash with our own       that  indeed   said cecilia  smiling   is a truth incontrovertible  and  a truth to which  for the future  i will endeavour to give more weight   but will you permit me now to ask one question   can you tell me  from whom  how  or when the intelligence which has caused all this  disturbance        she hesitated  but  comprehending her readily  he answered  how they got  at it  i never heard  for i never thought it worth while to enquire  as  it is so generally known  that nobody i meet with seems ignorant of it      this was another  and a cruel shock to cecilia  and dr lyster   perceiving it  again attempted to comfort her   that the affair is  somewhat spread   said he   is now not to be helped  and therefore  little worth thinking of  every body will agree that the choice of  both does honour to both  and nobody need be ashamed to be successor to  either  whenever the course of things leads mr mortimer and yourself  to make another election  he wisely intends to go abroad  and will not  return till he is his own man again  and as to you  my good young  lady  what  after a short time given to vexation  need interrupt your  happiness  you have the whole world before you  with youth  fortune   talents  beauty and independence  drive  therefore  from your head  this unlucky affair  and remember there can hardly be a family in the  kingdom  this one excepted  that will not rejoice in a connection with  you      he then good humouredly shook hands with her  and went into his chaise     cecilia  though not slow in remarking the ease and philosophy with  which every one can argue upon the calamities  and moralize upon the  misconduct of others  had still the candour and good sense to see that  there was reason in what he urged  and to resolve upon making the best  use in her power of the hints for consolation she might draw from his  discourse     during the following week  she devoted herself almost wholly to mrs  delvile  sharing with the maid  whom she had brought with her from the  castle  the fatigue of nursing her  and leaving to the miss charltons  the chief care of their grandmother  for mrs delvile appeared every hour  more sensible of her attention  and more desirous of her presence  and  though neither of them spoke  each was endeared to the other by the  tender offices of friendship which were paid and received     when this week was expired  dr lyster was prevailed upon to return again  to bury  in order to travel himself with mrs delvile to bristol   well    cried he  taking cecilia by the first opportunity aside   how are you   have you studied my scheme of philosophy  as you promised me       o yes   said she   and made  i flatter myself  no little proficiency       you are a good girl   cried he   a very extraordinary girl  i am sure  you are  and upon my honour i pity poor mortimer with all my soul  but  he is a noble young fellow  and behaves with a courage and spirit that  does me good to behold  to have obtained you  he would have moved heaven  and earth  but finding you out of his reach  he submits to his fate like  a man      cecilia s eyes glistened at this speech   yes   said she   he long since  said  tis suspence   tis hope  that make the misery of life   for there  the passions have all power  and reason has none  but when evils are  irremediable  and we have neither resources to plan  nor castle building  to delude us  we find time for the cultivation of philosophy  and  flatter ourselves  perhaps  that we have found inclination       why you have considered this matter very deeply   said he   but i must  not have you give way to these serious reflections  thought  after all   has a cruel spite against happiness  i would have you  therefore  keep  as much as you conveniently can  out of its company  run about and  divert yourself   tis all you have for it  the true art of happiness in  this most whimsical world  seems nothing more nor less than this  let  those who have leisure  find employment  and those who have business   find leisure      he then told her that mr delvile senior was much better  and no longer  confined to his room  and that he had had the pleasure of seeing an  entire reconciliation take place between him and his son  of whom he was  more fond and more proud than any other father in the universe      think of him  however  my dear young lady   he continued   no more   for the matter i see is desperate  you must pardon my being a little  officious  when i confess to you i could not help proposing to the old  gentleman an expedient of my own  for as i could not drive you out of  my head  i employed myself in thinking what might be done by way of  accommodation  now my scheme was really a very good one  only when  people are prejudiced  all reasoning is thrown away upon them  i  proposed sinking  both  your names  since they are so at variance  with one another  and so adopting a third  by means of a title  but mr  delvile angrily declared  that though such a scheme might do very  well for the needy lord ernolf  a peer of twenty years  his own noble  ancestors should never  by his consent  forfeit a name which so many  centuries had rendered honourable  his son mortimer  he added  must  inevitably inherit the title of his grandfather  his uncle being old  and unmarried  but yet he would rather see him a beggar  than lose his  dearest hope that  delvile   lord  delvile   would descend  both name  and title  from generation to generation unsullied and uninterrupted       i am sorry  indeed   said cecilia   that such a proposal was made  and  i earnestly entreat that none of any sort may be repeated       well  well   said he   i would not for the world do any mischief  but  who would not have supposed such a proposal would have done good       mr mortimer   he then added   is to meet us at  for he would not  he  said  come again to this place  upon such terms as he was here last  week  for the whole worth of the king s dominions      the carriage was now ready  and mrs delvile was prepared to depart   cecilia approached to take leave of her  but dr lyster following  said   no talking  no thanking  no compliments of any sort  i shall carry off  my patient without permitting one civil speech  and for all the rudeness  i make her guilty of  i am willing to be responsible      cecilia would then have retreated  but mrs delvile  holding out both her  hands  said  to every thing else  dr lyster  i am content to submit  but  were i to die while uttering the words  i cannot leave this inestimable  creature without first saying how much i love her  how i honour  and  how i thank her  without entreating her to be careful of her health  and  conjuring her to compleat the greatness of her conduct  by not suffering  her spirits to sink from the exertion of her virtue  and now my love   god bless you      she then embraced her  and went on  cecilia  at a motion of dr lyster s   forbearing to follow her      and thus   cried she  when they were gone   thus ends all my connection  with this family  which it seems as if i was only to have known for the  purpose of affording a new proof of the insufficiency of situation to  constitute happiness  who looks not upon mine as the perfection of  human felicity   and so  perhaps  it is  for it may be that felicity and  humanity are never permitted to come nearer      and thus  in philosophic sadness  by reasoning upon the universality  of misery  she restrained  at least  all violence of sorrow  though her  spirits were dejected  and her heart was heavy     but the next day brought with it some comfort that a little lightened  her sadness  mrs charlton  almost wholly recovered  was able to go down  stairs  and cecilia had at least the satisfaction of seeing an happy  conclusion to an illness of which  with the utmost concern and regret   she considered herself as the cause  she attended her with the most  unremitting assiduity  and being really very thankful  endeavoured  to appear happy  and flattered herself that  by continual effort  the  appearance in a short time would become reality     mrs charlton retired early  and cecilia accompanied her up stairs   and while she was with her  was informed that mr monckton was in the  parlour     the various  afflicting  and uncommon scenes in which she had been  engaged since she last saw him  had almost wholly driven him from her  remembrance  or when at any time he recurred to it  it was only to  attribute the discontinuance of his visits to the offence she had  given him  in refusing to follow his advice by relinquishing her london  expedition     full  therefore  of the mortifying transactions which had passed since  their parting  and fearful of his enquiries into disgraces he had nearly  foretold  she heard him announced with chagrin  and waited upon him in  the most painful confusion     far different were the feelings of mr monckton  he read in her  countenance the dejection of disappointment  which impressed upon his  heart the vivacity of hope  her evident shame was to him secret triumph   her ill concealed sorrow revived all his expectations     she hastily began a conversation by mentioning her debt to him  and  apologising for not paying it the moment she was of age  he knew but  too well how her time had been occupied  and assured her the delay was  wholly immaterial     he then led to an enquiry into the present situation of her affairs   but unable to endure a disquisition  which could only be productive of  censure and mortification  she hastily stopt it  exclaiming   ask me  not  i entreat you  sir  any detail of what has passed   the event has  brought me sufferings that may well make blame be dispensed with   i  acknowledge all your wisdom  i am sensible of my own error  but the  affair is wholly dropt  and the unhappy connection i was forming is  broken off for ever      little now was mr monckton s effort in repressing his further curiosity   and he started other subjects with readiness  gaiety and address  he  mentioned mrs charlton  for whom he had not the smallest regard  he  talked to her of mrs harrel  whose very existence was indifferent to  him  and he spoke of their common acquaintance in the country  for not  one of whom he would have grieved  if assured of meeting no more  his  powers of conversation were enlivened by his hopes  and his exhilarated  spirits made all subjects seem happy to him  a weight was removed from  his mind which had nearly borne down even his remotest hopes  the object  of his eager pursuit seemed still within his reach  and the rival into  whose power he had so lately almost beheld her delivered  was totally  renounced  and no longer to be dreaded  a revolution such as this   raised expectations more sanguine than ever  and in quitting the house   he exultingly considered himself released from every obstacle to his  views  till  just as he arrived home  he recollected his wife         chapter viii     a tale     a week passed  during which cecilia  however sad  spent her time as  usual with the family  denying to herself all voluntary indulgence of  grief  and forbearing to seek consolation from solitude  or relief from  tears  she never named delvile  she begged mrs charlton never to mention  him  she called to her aid the account she had received from dr lyster  of his firmness  and endeavoured  by an emulous ambition  to fortify her  mind from the weakness of depression and regret     this week  a week of struggle with all her feelings  was just elapsed   when she received by the post the following letter from mrs delvile      to miss beverley      bristol   oct          my sweet young friend will not  i hope  be sorry to hear of my safe  arrival at this place  to me every account of her health and welfare   will ever be the intelligence i shall most covet to receive  yet i mean  not to ask for it in return  to chance i will trust for information  and  i only write now to say i shall write no more     too much for thanks is what i owe you  and what i think of you is beyond  all power of expression  do not  then  wish me ill  ill as i have seemed  to merit of you  for my own heart is almost broken by the tyranny i have  been compelled to practise upon yours  and now let me bid a long adieu  to you  my admirable cecilia  you shall not be tormented with a useless  correspondence  which can only awaken painful recollections  or give  rise to yet more painful new anxieties  fervently will i pray for  the restoration of your happiness  to which nothing can so greatly  contribute as that wise  that uniform command  so feminine  yet so  dignified  you maintain over your passions  which often i have admired   though never so feelingly as at this conscious moment  when my own  health is the sacrifice of emotions most fatally unrestrained     send to me no answer  even if you have the sweetness to wish it  every  new proof of the generosity of your nature is to me but a new wound   forget us  therefore  wholly   alas  you have only known us for sorrow   forget us  dear and invaluable cecilia  though  ever  as you have  nobly deserved  must you be fondly and gratefully remembered by augusta  delvile     the attempted philosophy  and laboured resignation of cecilia  this  letter destroyed  the struggle was over  the apathy was at an end  and  she burst into an agony of tears  which finding the vent they had  long sought  now flowed unchecked down her cheeks  sad monitors of the  weakness of reason opposed to the anguish of sorrow     a letter at once so caressing  yet so absolute  forced its way to her  heart  in spite of the fortitude she had flattered herself was its  guard  in giving up delvile she was satisfied of the propriety of seeing  him no more  and convinced that even to talk of him would be folly  and imprudence  but to be told that for the future they must remain  strangers to the existence of each other  there seemed in this a  hardship  a rigour  that was insupportable      oh what   cried she   is human nature  in its best state how imperfect   that a woman such as this  so noble in character  so elevated in  sentiment  with heroism to sacrifice to her sense of duty the happiness  of a son  whom with joy she would die to serve  can herself be thus  governed by prejudice  thus enslaved  thus subdued by opinion   yet  never  even when miserable  unjust or irrational  her grief was unmixed  with anger  and her tears streamed not from resentment  but affliction   the situation of mrs delvile  however different  she considered to be  as wretched as her own  she read  therefore  with sadness  but not  bitterness  her farewell  and received not with disdain  but with  gratitude  her sympathy  yet though her indignation was not irritated   her sufferings were doubled  by a farewell so kind  yet so despotic  a  sympathy so affectionate  yet so hopeless     in this first indulgence of grief which she had granted to her  disappointment  she was soon interrupted by a summons down stairs to a  gentleman     unfit and unwilling to be seen  she begged that he might leave his name   and appoint a time for calling again     her maid brought for answer  that he believed his name was unknown to  her  and desired to see her now  unless she was employed in some matter  of moment  she then put up her letter  and went into the parlour  and  there  to her infinite amazement  beheld mr albany      how little  sir   she cried   did i expect this pleasure       this pleasure   repeated he   do you call it   what strange abuse of  words  what causeless trifling with honesty  is language of no purpose  but to wound the ear with untruths  is the gift of speech only granted  us to pervert the use of understanding  i can give you no pleasure   i have no power to give it any one  you can give none to me the whole  world could not invest you with the means       well  sir   said cecilia  who had little spirit to defend herself   i  will not vindicate the expression  but of this i will unfeignedly assure  you  i am at least as glad to see you just now  as i should be to see  anybody       your eyes   cried he   are red  your voice is inarticulate   young   rich  and attractive  the world at your feet  that world yet untried   and its falsehood unknown  how have you thus found means to anticipate  misery  which way have you uncovered the cauldron of human woes  fatal  and early anticipation  that cover once removed  can never be replaced   those woes  those boiling woes  will pour out upon you continually   and only when your heart ceases to beat  will their ebullition cease to  torture you       alas   cried cecilia  shuddering   how cruel  yet how true       why went you   cried he   to the cauldron  it came not to you  misery  seeks not man  but man misery  he walks out in the sun  but stops  not for a cloud  confident  he pursues his way  till the storm which   gathering  he might have avoided  bursts over his devoted head  scared  and amazed  he repents his temerity  he calls  but it is then too late   he runs  but it is thunder which follows him  such is the presumption  of man  such at once is the arrogance and shallowness of his nature  and  thou  simple and blind  hast thou  too  followed whither fancy has led  thee  unheeding that thy career was too vehement for tranquility   nor missing that lovely companion of youth s early innocence  till   adventurous and unthinking  thou hast lost her for ever      in the present weak state of cecilia s spirits  this attack was too much  for her  and the tears she had just  and with difficulty restrained   again forced their way down her cheeks  as she answered   it is but too  true   i have lost her for ever       poor thing   said he  while the rigour of his countenance was  softened into the gentlest commiseration   so young   looking  too  so  innocent   tis hard   and is nothing left thee  no small remaining hope   to cheat  humanely cheat thy yet not wholly extinguished credulity      cecilia wept without answering      let me not   said he   waste my compassion upon nothing  compassion is  with me no effusion of affectation  tell me  then  if thou deservest it   or if thy misfortunes are imaginary  and thy grief is factitious       factitious   repeated she   good heaven       answer me  then  these questions  in which i shall comprise the only  calamities for which sorrow has no controul  or none from human motives   tell me  then  have you lost by death the friend of your bosom       no       is your fortune dissipated by extravagance  and your power of relieving  the distressed at an end       no  the power and the will are i hope equally undiminished       o then  unhappy girl  have you been guilty of some vice  and hangs  remorse thus heavy on your conscience       no  no  thank heaven  to that misery  at least  i am a stranger      his countenance now again resumed its severity  and  in the sternest  manner   whence then   he said   these tears  and what is this caprice  you dignify with the name of sorrow   strange wantonness of indolence  and luxury  perverse repining of ungrateful plenitude   oh hadst thou  known what  i  have suffered         could i lessen what you have suffered   said cecilia   i should  sincerely rejoice  but heavy indeed must be your affliction  if mine in  its comparison deserves to be styled caprice       caprice   repeated he    tis joy   tis extacy compared with mine   thou  hast not in licentiousness wasted thy inheritance  thou hast not by  remorse barred each avenue to enjoyment  nor yet has the cold grave  seized the beloved of thy soul       neither   said cecilia   i hope  are the evils you have yourself  sustained so irremediable       yes  i have borne them all    have  borne  i bear them still  i shall  bear them while i breathe  i may rue them  perhaps  yet longer       good god   cried cecilia  shrinking   what a world is this  how full of  woe and wickedness       yet thou  too  canst complain   cried he   though happy in life s only  blessing  innocence  thou  too  canst murmur  though stranger to death s  only terror  sin  oh yet if thy sorrow is unpolluted with guilt  be  regardless of all else  and rejoice in thy destiny       but who   cried she  deeply sighing   shall teach me such a lesson of  joy  when all within rises to oppose it       i   cried he   will teach it thee  for i will tell thee my own sad  story  then wilt thou find how much happier is thy lot  then wilt thou  raise thy head in thankful triumph       o no  triumph comes not so lightly  yet if you will venture to trust  me with some account of yourself  i shall be glad to hear it  and much  obliged by the communication       i will   he answered   whatever i may suffer  to awaken thee from this  dream of fancied sorrow  i will open all my wounds  and thou shalt probe  them with fresh shame       no  indeed   cried cecilia with quickness   i will not hear you  if the  relation will be so painful       upon  me  this humanity is lost   said he   since punishment and  penitence alone give me comfort  i will tell thee  therefore  my crimes   that thou mayst know thy own felicity  lest  ignorant it means nothing  but innocence  thou shouldst lose it  unconscious of its value  listen  then to me  and learn what misery is  guilt is alone the basis of  lasting unhappiness   guilt is the basis of mine  and therefore i am a  wretch for ever      cecilia would again have declined hearing him  but he refused to be  spared  and as her curiosity had long been excited to know something of  his history  and the motives of his extraordinary conduct  she was glad  to have it satisfied  and gave him the utmost attention      i will not speak to you of my family   said he   historical accuracy  would little answer to either of us  i am a native of the west indies   and i was early sent hither to be educated  while i was yet at the  university  i saw  i adored  and i pursued the fairest flower that ever  put forth its sweet buds  the softest heart that ever was broken by  ill usage  she was poor and unprotected  the daughter of a villager   she was untaught and unpretending  the child of simplicity  but fifteen  summers had she bloomed  and her heart was an easy conquest  yet  once  made mine  it resisted all allurement to infidelity  my fellow students  attacked her  she was assaulted by all the arts of seduction  flattery   bribery  supplication  all were employed  yet all failed  she was wholly  my own  and with sincerity so attractive  i determined to marry her in  defiance of all worldly objections      the sudden death of my father called me hastily to jamaica  i feared  leaving this treasure unguarded  yet in decency could neither marry nor  take her directly  i pledged my faith  therefore  to return to her   as soon as i had settled my affairs  and i left to a bosom friend the  inspection of her conduct in my absence      to leave her was madness   to trust in man was madness   oh hateful  race  how has the world been abhorrent to me since that time  i have  loathed the light of the sun  i have shrunk from the commerce of my  fellow creatures  the voice of man i have detested  his sight i have  abominated   but oh  more than all should i be abominated myself      when i came to my fortune  intoxicated with sudden power  i forgot this  fair blossom  i revelled in licentiousness and vice  and left it exposed  and forlorn  riot succeeded riot  till a fever  incurred by my own  intemperance  first gave me time to think  then was she revenged  for  then first remorse was my portion  her image was brought back to my mind  with frantic fondness  and bitterest contrition  the moment i recovered   i returned to england  i flew to claim her   but she was lost  no one  knew whither she was gone  the wretch i had trusted pretended to know  least of all  yet  after a furious search  i traced her to a cottage   where he had concealed her himself      when she saw me  she screamed and would have flown  i stopt her  and  told her i came faithfully and honourably to make her my wife   her  own faith and honour  though sullied  were not extinguished  for she  instantly acknowledged the fatal tale of her undoing      did i recompense this ingenuousness  this unexampled  this beautiful  sacrifice to intuitive integrity  yes  with my curses   i loaded her  with execrations  i reviled her in language the most opprobrious  i  insulted her even for her confession  i invoked all evil upon her  from the bottom of my heart  she knelt at my feet  she implored  my forgiveness and compassion  she wept with the bitterness of  despair   and yet i spurned her from me   spurned   let me not hide  my shame  i barbarously struck her   nor single was the blow   it was  doubled  it was reiterated   oh wretch  unyielding and unpitying   where shall hereafter be clemency for thee   so fair a form  so young a  culprit  so infamously seduced  so humbly penitent      in this miserable condition  helpless and deplorable  mangled by these  savage hands  and reviled by this inhuman tongue  i left her  in search  of the villain who had destroyed her  but  cowardly as treacherous   he had absconded  repenting my fury  i hastened to her again  the  fierceness of my cruelty shamed me when i grew calmer  the softness of  her sorrow melted me upon recollection  i returned  therefore  to soothe  her   but again she was gone  terrified with expectation of insult  she  hid herself from all my enquiries  i wandered in search of her two long  years to no purpose  regardless of my affairs  and of all things but  that pursuit  at length  i thought i saw her  in london  alone  and  walking in the streets at midnight   i fearfully followed her   and  followed her into an house of infamy      the wretches by whom she was surrounded were noisy and drinking  they  heeded me little   but she saw and knew me at once  she did not speak   nor did i   but in two moments she fainted and fell      yet did i not help her  the people took their own measures to recover  her  and when she was again able to stand  would have removed her to  another apartment      i then went forward  and forcing them away from her with all the  strength of desperation  i turned to the unhappy sinner  who to chance  only seemed to leave what became of her  and cried  from this scene of  vice and horror let me yet rescue you  you look still unfit for such  society  trust yourself  therefore  to me  i seized her hand  i drew   i almost dragged her away  she trembled  she could scarce totter  but  neither consented nor refused  neither shed a tear  nor spoke a word   and her countenance presented a picture of affright  amazement  and  horror      i took her to a house in the country  each of us silent the whole way   i gave her an apartment and a female attendant  and ordered for her  every convenience i could suggest  i stayed myself in the same house   but distracted with remorse for the guilt and ruin into which i had  terrified her  i could not bear her sight      in a few days her maid assured me the life she led must destroy her   that she would taste nothing but bread and water  never spoke  and never  slept      alarmed by this account  i flew into her apartment  pride and  resentment gave way to pity and fondness  and i besought her to take  comfort  i spoke  however  to a statue  she replied not  nor seemed to  hear me  i then humbled myself to her as in the days of her innocence  and first power  supplicating her notice  entreating even her  commiseration  all was to no purpose  she neither received nor repulsed  me  and was alike inattentive to exhortation and to prayer      whole hours did i spend at her feet  vowing never to arise till she  spoke to me   all  all  in vain  she seemed deaf  mute  insensible  her  face unmoved  a settled despair fixed in her eyes   those eyes that had  never looked at me but with dove like softness and compliance   she sat  constantly in one chair  she never changed her dress  no persuasions  could prevail with her to lie down  and at meals she just swallowed so  much dry bread as might save her from dying for want of food      what was the distraction of my soul  to find her bent upon this course  to her last hour   quick came that hour  but never will it be forgotten   rapidly it was gone  but eternally it will be remembered      when she felt herself expiring  she acknowledged she had made a  vow  upon entering the house  to live speechless and motionless  as a  pennance for her offences      i kept her loved corpse till my own senses failed me   it was then only  torn from me   and i have lost all recollection of three years of my  existence      cecilia shuddered at this hint  yet was not surprised by it  mr gosport  had acquainted her he had been formerly confined  and his flightiness   wildness  florid language  and extraordinary way of life  bad long led  her to suspect his reason had been impaired      the scene to which my memory first leads me back   he continued   is  visiting her grave  solemnly upon it i returned her vow  though not by  one of equal severity  to her poor remains did i pledge myself  that  the day should never pass in which i would receive nourishment  nor the  night come in which i would take rest  till i had done  or zealously  attempted to do  some service to a fellow creature      for this purpose have i wandered from city to city  from the town to  the country  and from the rich to the poor  i go into every house where  i can gain admittance  i admonish all who will hear me  i shame even  those who will not  i seek the distressed where ever they are hid   i follow the prosperous to beg a mite to serve them  i look for the  dissipated in public  where  amidst their licentiousness  i check them   i pursue the unhappy in private  where i counsel and endeavour to  assist them  my own power is small  my relations  during my sufferings   limiting me to an annuity  but there is no one i scruple to solicit  and  by zeal i supply ability      oh life of hardship and pennance  laborious  toilsome  and restless   but i have merited no better  and i will not repine at it  i have vowed  that i will endure it  and i will not be forsworn      one indulgence alone from time to time i allow myself    tis music   which has power to delight me even to rapture  it quiets all anxiety  it  carries me out of myself  i forget through it every calamity  even the  bitterest anguish      now then  that thou hast heard me  tell me  hast  thou  cause of  sorrow       alas   cried cecilia   this indeed is a picture of misery to make  my   lot seem all happiness       art thou thus open to conviction   cried he  mildly   and dost thou not  fly the voice of truth  for truth and reproof are one       no  i would rather seek it  i feel myself wretched  however inadequate  may be the cause  i wish to be more resigned  and if you can instruct me  how  i shall thankfully attend to you       oh yet uncorrupted creature   cried he   with joy will i be thy  monitor   joy long untasted  many have i wished to serve  all  hitherto   have rejected my offices  too honest to flatter them  they had not the  fortitude to listen to me  too low to advance them  they had not the  virtue to bear with me  you alone have i yet found pure enough not to  fear inspection  and good enough to wish to be better  yet words alone  will not content me  i must also have deeds  nor will your purse   however readily opened  suffice  you must give to me also your time  and your thoughts  for money sent by others  to others only will afford  relief  to enlighten your own cares  you must distribute it yourself       you shall find me   said she   a docile pupil  and most glad to be  instructed how my existence may be useful       happy then   cried he   was the hour that brought me to this country   yet not in search of you did i come  but of the mutable and ill fated  belfield  erring  yet ingenious young man  what a lesson to the vanity  of talents  to the gaiety  the brilliancy of wit  is the sight of that  green fallen plant  not sapless by age  nor withered by disease   but destroyed by want of pruning  and bending  breaking by its own  luxuriance       and where  sir  is he now      labouring wilfully in the field  with those who labour compulsatorily   such are we all by nature  discontented  perverse  and changeable   though all have not courage to appear so  and few  like belfield  are  worth watching when they do  he told me he was happy  i knew it could  not be  but his employment was inoffensive  and i left him without  reproach  in this neighbourhood i heard of you  and found your name was  coupled with praise  i came to see if you deserved it  i have seen  and  am satisfied       you are not  then  very difficult  for i have yet done nothing  how are  we to begin these operations you propose  you have awakened me by them  to an expectation of pleasure  which nothing else  i believe  could just  now have given me       we will work   cried he   together  till not a woe shall remain upon  your mind  the blessings of the fatherless  the prayers of little  children  shall heal all your wounds with balm of sweetest fragrance   when sad  they shall cheer  when complaining  they shall soothe you  we  will go to their roofless houses  and see them repaired  we will exclude  from their dwellings the inclemency of the weather  we will clothe them  from cold  we will rescue them from hunger  the cries of distress shall  be changed to notes of joy  your heart shall be enraptured  mine  too   shall revive  oh whither am i wandering  i am painting an elysium   and while i idly speak  some fainting object dies for want of succour   farewell  i will fly to the abodes of wretchedness  and come to you  to morrow to render them the abodes of happiness      he then went away     this singular visit was for cecilia most fortunately timed  it almost  surprised her out of her peculiar grief  by the view which it opened  to her of general calamity  wild  flighty  and imaginative as were  his language and his counsels  their morality was striking  and their  benevolence was affecting  taught by him to compare her state with that  of at least half her species  she began more candidly to weigh what was  left with what was withdrawn  and found the balance in her favour   the plan he had presented to her of good works was consonant to her  character and inclinations  and the active charity in which he proposed  to engage her  re animated her fallen hopes  though to far different  subjects from those which had depressed them  any scheme of worldly  happiness would have sickened and disgusted her  but her mind was just  in the situation to be impressed with elevated piety  and to adopt any  design in which virtue humoured melancholy         chapter ix     a shock     cecelia passed the rest of the day in fanciful projects of beneficence   she determined to wander with her romantic new ally whither so ever  he would lead her  and to spare neither fortune  time  nor trouble  in  seeking and relieving the distressed  not all her attempted philosophy  had calmed her mind like this plan  in merely refusing indulgence  to grief  she had only locked it up in her heart  where eternally  struggling for vent  she was almost overpowered by restraining it  but  now her affliction had no longer her whole faculties to itself  the hope  of doing good  the pleasure of easing pain  the intention of devoting  her time to the service of the unhappy  once more delighted her  imagination   that source of promissory enjoyment  which though often  obstructed  is never  in youth  exhausted     she would not give mrs charlton the unnecessary pain of hearing the  letter with which she had been so  much affected  but she told her of  the visit of albany  and pleased her with the account of their scheme     at night  with less sadness than usual  she retired to rest  in her  sleep she bestowed riches  and poured plenty upon the land  she  humbled the oppressor  she exalted the oppressed  slaves were raised to  dignities  captives restored to liberty  beggars saw smiling abundance   and wretchedness was banished the world  from a cloud in which she was  supported by angels  cecilia beheld these wonders  and while enjoying  the glorious illusion  she was awakened by her maid  with news that mrs  charlton was dying     she started up  and  undressed  was running to her apartment   when the  maid  calling to stop her  confessed she was already dead     she had made her exit in the night  but the time was not exactly known   her own maid  who slept in the room with her  going early to her bedside  to enquire how she did  found her cold and motionless  and could only  conclude that a paralytic stroke had taken her off     happily and in good time had cecilia been somewhat recruited by one  night of refreshing slumbers and flattering dreams  for the shock she  now received promised her not soon another     she lost in mrs charlton a friend  whom nearly from her infancy she  had considered as a mother  and by whom she had been cherished with  tenderness almost unequalled  she was not a woman of bright parts  or  much cultivation  but her heart was excellent  and her disposition was  amiable  cecilia had known her longer than her memory could look back   though the earliest circumstances she could trace were kindnesses  received from her  since she had entered into life  and found the  difficulty of the part she had to act  to this worthy old lady alone had  she unbosomed her secret cares  though little assisted by her counsel   she was always certain of her sympathy  and while her own superior  judgment directed her conduct  she had the relief of communicating her  schemes  and weighing her perplexities  with a friend to whom nothing  that concerned her was indifferent  and whose greatest wish and chief  pleasure was the enjoyment of her conversation     if left to herself  in the present period of her life  mrs charlton had  certainly not been the friend of her choice  the delicacy of her mind   and the refinement of her ideas  had now rendered her fastidious   and she would have looked out for elegancies and talents to which mrs  charlton had no pretensions  but those who live in the country have  little power of selection  confined to a small circle  they must be  content with what it offers  and however they may idolize extraordinary  merit when they meet with it  they must not regard it as essential to  friendship  for in their circumscribed rotation  whatever may be their  discontent  they can make but little change     such had been the situation to which mrs charlton and mrs harrel owed  the friendship of cecilia  greatly their superior in understanding and  intelligence  had the candidates for her favour been more numerous  the  election had not fallen upon either of them  but she became known to  both before discrimination made her difficult  and when her enlightened  mind discerned their deficiencies  they had already an interest in her  affections  which made her see them with lenity  and though sometimes   perhaps  conscious she should not have chosen them from many  she  adhered to them with sincerity  and would have changed them for none     mrs harrel  however  too weak for similar sentiments  forgot her  when out of sight  and by the time they met again  was insensible to  everything but shew and dissipation  cecilia  shocked and surprised   first grieved from disappointed affection  and then lost that affection  in angry contempt  but her fondness for mrs charlton had never known  abatement  as the kindness which had excited it had never known  allay  she had loved her first from childish gratitude  but that love   strengthened and confirmed by confidential intercourse  was now as  sincere and affectionate as if it had originated from sympathetic  admiration  her loss  therefore  was felt with the utmost severity  and  neither seeing nor knowing any means of replacing it  she considered it  as irreparable  and mourned it with bitterness     when the first surprize of this cruel stroke was somewhat lessened  she  sent an express to mr monckton with the news  and entreated to see him  immediately  he came without delay  and she begged his counsel what step  she ought herself to take in consequence of this event  her own house  was still unprepared for her  she had of late neglected to hasten the  workmen  and almost forgotten her intention of entering it  it was  necessary  however  to change her abode immediately  she was no  longer in the house of mrs charlton  but of her grand daughters and  co heiresses  each of whom she disliked  and upon neither of whom she  had any claim     mr monckton then  with the quickness of a man who utters a thought at  the very moment of its projection  mentioned a scheme upon which  during his whole ride he had been ruminating  which was that she would  instantly remove to his house  and remain there till settled to her  satisfaction     cecilia objected her little right of surprising lady margaret  but   without waiting to discuss it  lest new objections should arise  he  quitted her  to fetch himself from her ladyship an invitation he meant  to insist upon her sending     cecilia  though heartily disliking this plan  knew not at present what  better to adopt  and thought anything preferable to going again to  mrs harrel  since that only could be done by feeding the anxiety of mr  arnott     mr monckton soon returned with a message of his own fabrication  for  his lady  though obliged to receive whom he pleased  took care to guard  inviolate the independence of speech  sullenly persevering in refusing  to say anything  or perversely saying only what he least wished to hear     cecilia then took a hasty leave of miss charltons  who  little affected  by what they had lost  and eager to examine what they had gained  parted  from her gladly  and  with a heavy heart and weeping eyes  borrowed for  the last time the carriage of her late worthy old friend  and for ever  quitting her hospitable house  sorrowfully set out for the grove         book ix         chapter i     a cogitation     lady margaret monckton received cecilia with the most gloomy coldness   she apologised for the liberty she had taken in making use of her  ladyship s house  but  meeting no return of civility  she withdrew  to the room which had been prepared for her  and resolved as much as  possible to keep out of her sight     it now became necessary without further delay to settle her plan of  life  and fix her place of residence  the forbidding looks of lady  margaret made her hasten her resolves  which otherwise would for a while  have given way to grief for her recent misfortune     she sent for the surveyor who had the superintendance of her estates  to  enquire how soon her own house would be fit for her reception  and heard  there was yet work for near two months     this answer made her very uncomfortable  to continue two months under  the roof with lady margaret was a penance she could not enjoin herself   nor was she at all sure lady margaret would submit to it any better  she  determined  therefore  to release herself from the conscious burthen of  being an unwelcome visitor  by boarding with some creditable family at  bury  and devoting the two months in which she was to be kept from her  house  to a general arrangement of her affairs  and a final settling  with her guardians     for these purposes it would be necessary she should go to london   but with whom  or in what manner  she could not decide  she desired   therefore  another conference with mr monckton  who met her in the  parlour     she then communicated to him her schemes  and begged his counsel in her  perplexities     he was delighted at the application  and extremely well pleased with her  design of boarding at bury  well knowing  he could then watch and visit  her at his pleasure  and have far more comfort in her society than even  in his own house  where all the vigilance with which he observed her   was short of that with which he was himself observed by lady margaret   he endeavoured  however  to dissuade her from going to town  but her  eagerness to pay the large sum she owed him  was now too great to be  conquered  of age  her fortune wholly in her power  and all attendance  upon mrs charlton at an end  she had no longer any excuse for having a  debt in the world  and would suffer no persuasion to make her begin her  career in life  with a negligence in settling her accounts which she had  so often censured in others  to go to london therefore she was fixed   and all that she desired was his advice concerning the journey     he then told her that in order to settle with her guardians  she must  write to them in form  to demand an account of the sums that had been  expended during her minority  and announce her intention for the future  to take the management of her fortune into her own hands     she immediately followed his directions  and consented to remain at the  grove till their answers arrived     being now  therefore  unavoidably fixed for some time at the house  she  thought it proper and decent to attempt softening lady margaret in her  favour  she exerted all her powers to please and to oblige her  but the  exertion was necessarily vain  not only from the disposition  but the  situation of her ladyship  since every effort made for this conciliatory  purpose  rendered her doubly amiable in the eyes of her husband  and  consequently to herself more odious than ever  her jealousy  already but  too well founded  received every hour the poisonous nourishment of fresh  conviction  which so much soured and exasperated a temper naturally  harsh  that her malignity and ill humour grew daily more acrimonious   nor would she have contented herself with displaying this irascibility  by general moroseness  had not the same suspicious watchfulness which  discovered to her the passion of her husband  served equally to make  manifest the indifference and innocence of cecilia  to reproach her  therefore  she had not any pretence  though her knowledge how much she  had to dread her  past current in her mind for sufficient reason to  hate her  the angry and the violent use little discrimination  whom  they like  they enquire not if they approve  but whoever  no matter  how unwittingly  stands in their way  they scruple not to ill use  and  conclude they may laudably detest     cecilia  though much disgusted  gave not over her attempt  which she  considered but as her due while she continued in her house  her general  character  also  for peevishness and haughty ill breeding  skilfully   from time to time  displayed  and artfully repined at by mr monckton   still kept her from suspecting any peculiar animosity to herself  and  made her impute all that passed to the mere rancour of ill humour  she  confined herself  however  as much as possible to her own apartment   where her sorrow for mrs charlton almost hourly increased  by the  comparison she was forced upon making of her house with the grove     that worthy old lady left her grand daughters her co heiresses and sole  executrixes  she bequeathed from them nothing considerable  though  she left some donations for the poor  and several of her friends were  remembered by small legacies  among them cecilia had her picture  and  favourite trinkets  with a paragraph in her will  that as there was no  one she so much loved  had her fortune been less splendid  she should  have shared with her grand daughters whatever she had to bestow     cecilia was much affected by this last and solemn remembrance  she more  than ever coveted to be alone  that she might grieve undisturbed  and  she lamented without ceasing the fatigue and the illness which  in so  late a period  as it proved  of her life  she had herself been the means  of occasioning to her     mr monckton had too much prudence to interrupt this desire of solitude   which indeed cost him little pain  as he considered her least in  danger when alone  she received in about a week answers from both her  guardians  mr delvile s letter was closely to the purpose  without a  word but of business  and couched in the haughtiest terms  as he had  never  he said  acted  he had no accounts to send in  but as he was  going to town in a few days  he would see her for a moment in the  presence of mr briggs  that a joint release might be signed  to prevent  any future application to him     cecilia much lamented there was any necessity for her seeing him at all   and looked forward to the interview as the greatest mortification she  could suffer     mr briggs  though still more concise  was far kinder in his language   but he advised her to defer her scheme of taking the money into her own  hands  assuring her she would be cheated  and had better leave it to  him     when she communicated these epistles to mr monckton  he failed not to  read  with an emphasis  by which his arrogant meaning was still more  arrogantly enforced  the letter of mr delvile aloud  nor was he sparing  in comments that might render it yet more offensive  cecilia neither  concurred in what he said  nor opposed it  but contented herself  when  he was silent  with producing the other letter     mr monckton read not this with more favour  he openly attacked the  character of briggs  as covetous  rapacious  and over reaching  and  warned her by no means to abide by his counsel  without first taking the  opinion of some disinterested person  he then stated the various arts  which might be practised upon her inexperience  enumerated the dangers  to which her ignorance of business exposed her  and annotated upon  the cheats  double dealings  and tricks of stock jobbing  to which  he assured her mr briggs owed all he was worth  till  perplexed and  confounded  she declared herself at a loss how to proceed  and earnestly  regretted that she could not have his counsel upon the spot     this was his aim  to draw the wish from her  drew all suspicion of  selfish views from himself  and he told her that he considered her  present situation as so critical  the future confusion or regularity  of her money transactions seeming to depend upon it  that he would  endeavour to arrange his affairs for meeting her in london     cecilia gave him many thanks for the kind intention  and determined to  be totally guided by him in the disposal and direction of her fortune     mean time he had now another part to act  he saw that with cecilia  nothing more remained to be done  and that  harbouring not a doubt of  his motives  she thought his design in her favour did her nothing but  honour  but he had too much knowledge of the world to believe it would  judge him in the same manner  and too much consciousness of duplicity to  set its judgment at defiance     to parry  therefore  the conjectures which might follow his attending  her  he had already prepared lady margaret to wish herself of the party   for however disagreeable to him was her presence and her company  he had  no other means to be under the same roof with cecilia     miss bennet  the wretched tool of his various schemes  and the mean  sycophant of his lady  had been employed by him to work upon her  jealousy  by secretly informing her of his intention to go to town   at the same time that cecilia went thither to meet her guardians   she pretended to have learned this intelligence by accident  and to  communicate it from respectful regard  and advised her to go to london  herself at the same time  that she might see into his designs  and be  some check upon his pleasure     the encreasing infirmities of lady margaret made this counsel by no  means palatable  but miss bennet  following the artful instructions  which she received  put in her way so strong a motive  by assuring her  how little her company was wished  that in the madness of her spite  she determined upon the journey  and little heeding how she tormented  herself while she had any view of tormenting mr monckton  she was led on  by her false confident to invite cecilia to her own house     mr monckton  in whom by long practice  artifice was almost nature  well  knowing his wife s perverseness  affected to look much disconcerted at  the proposal  while cecilia  by no means thinking it necessary to extend  her compliance to such a punishment  instantly made an apology  and  declined the invitation     lady margaret  little versed in civility  and unused to the arts of  persuasion  could not  even for a favourite project  prevail upon  herself to use entreaty  and therefore  thinking her scheme defeated   looked gloomily disappointed  and said nothing more     mr monckton saw with delight how much this difficulty inflamed her   though the moment he could speak alone with cecilia he made it his care  to remove it     he represented to her that  however privately she might live  she was  too young to be in london lodgings by herself  and gave an hint which  she could not but understand  that in going or in staying with only  servants  suspicions might soon be raised  that the plan and motive of  her journey were different to those given out     she knew he meant to insinuate that it would be conjectured she  designed to meet delvile  and though colouring  vext and provoked at the  suggestion  the idea was sufficient to frighten her into his plan     in a few days  therefore  the matter was wholly arranged  mr monckton   by his skill and address  leading every one whither he pleased  while   by the artful coolness of his manner  he appeared but to follow himself   he  set  out the day before  though earnestly wishing to accompany  them  but having as yet in no single instance gone to town in the same  carriage with lady margaret  he dared trust neither the neighbourhood  nor the servants with so dangerous a subject for their comments     cecilia  compelled thus to travel with only her ladyship and miss  bennet  had a journey the most disagreeable  and determined  if  possible  to stay in london but two days  she had already fixed upon a  house in which she could board at bury when she returned  and there she  meant quietly to reside till she could enter her own     lady margaret herself  exhilarated by a notion of having outwitted her  husband  was in unusual good spirits  and almost in good humour   the idea of thwarting his designs  and being in the way of his  entertainment  gave to her a delight she had seldom received from any  thing  and the belief that this was effected by the superiority of her  cunning  doubled her contentment  and raised it to exultation  she owed  him  indeed  much provocation and uneasiness  and was happy in this  opportunity of paying her arrears     mean while that consummate master in every species of hypocrisy   indulged her in this notion  by the air of dissatisfaction with which he  left the house  it was not that she meant by her presence to obviate any  impropriety  early and long acquainted with the character of cecilia   she well knew  that during her life the passion of her husband must be  confined to his own breast  but conscious of his aversion to herself   which she resented with the bitterest ill will  and knowing how little   at any time  he desired her company  she consoled herself for her  inability to give pleasure by the power she possessed of giving pain   and bore with the fatigue of a journey disagreeable and inconvenient  to her  with no other view than the hope of breaking into his plan of  avoiding her  little imagining that the whole time she was forwarding  his favourite pursuit  and only acting the part which he had appointed  her to perform         chapter ii     a surprize     lady margaret s town house was in soho square  and scarcely had cecilia  entered it  before her desire to speed her departure  made her send  a note to each of her guardians  acquainting them of her arrival  and  begging  if possible  to see them the next day     she had soon the two following answers      to miss cecilia beverley     these november           miss   received  yours of the same date  can t come tomorrow  will  wednesday the    th   am   c   jno  briggs     miss cecilia beverley     to miss beverley      mr delvile has too many affairs of importance upon his hands  to make  any appointment till he has deliberated how to arrange them  mr delvile  will acquaint miss beverley when it shall be in his power to see her     st james s square   nov        these characteristic letters  which at another time might have diverted  cecilia  now merely served to torment her  she was eager to quit town   she was more eager to have her meeting with mr delvile over  who   oppressive to her even when he meant to be kind  she foresaw  now he  was in wrath  would be imperious even to rudeness  desirous  however   to make one interview suffice for both  and to settle whatever business  might remain unfinished by letters  she again wrote to mr briggs   whom she had not spirits to encounter without absolute necessity  and  informing him of mr delvile s delay  begged he would not trouble himself  to call till he heard from her again     two days passed without any message from them  they were spent chiefly  alone  and very uncomfortably  mr monckton being content to see little  of her  while he knew she saw nothing of any body else  on the  third morning  weary of her own thoughts  weary of lady margaret s  ill humoured looks  and still more weary of miss bennet s parasitical  conversation  she determined  for a little relief to the heaviness of  her mind  to go to her bookseller  and look over and order into the  country such new publications as seemed to promise her any pleasure     she sent therefore  for a chair  and glad to have devised for herself  any amusement  set out in it immediately     upon entering the shop  she saw the bookseller engaged in close  conference with a man meanly dressed  and much muffled up  who  seemed talking to him with uncommon earnestness  and just as she was  approaching  said   to terms i am indifferent  for writing is no  labour to me  on the contrary  it is the first delight of my life  and  therefore  and not for dirty pelf  i wish to make it my profession      the speech struck cecilia  but the voice struck her more  it was  belfield s  and her amazement was so great  that she stopt short to look  at him  without heeding a man who attended her  and desired to know her  commands     the bookseller now perceiving her  came forward  and belfield  turning  to see who interrupted them  started as if a spectre had crossed his  eyes  slapped his hat over his face  and hastily went out of the shop     cecilia checking her inclination to speak to him  from observing his  eagerness to escape her  soon recollected her own errand  and employed  herself in looking over new books     her surprize  however  at a change so sudden in the condition of this  young man  and at a declaration of a passion for writing  so opposite to  all the sentiments which he had professed at their late meeting in  the cottage  awakened in her a strong curiosity to be informed of his  situation  and after putting aside some books which she desired to have  packed up for her  she asked if the gentleman who had just left the  shop  and who  she found by what he had said  was an author  had written  anything that was published with his name      no  ma am   answered the bookseller   nothing of any consequence  he  is known  however  to have written several things that have appeared as  anonymous  and i fancy  now  soon  we shall see something considerable  from him       he is about some great work  then       why no  not exactly that  perhaps  at present  we must feel our way   with some little smart  jeu d esprit  before we undertake a great work   but he is a very great genius  and i doubt not will produce something  extraordinary       whatever he produces   said cecilia   as i have now chanced to see him   i shall be glad you will  at any time  send to me       certainly  ma am  but it must be among other things  for he does not  chuse  just now to be known  and it is a rule in our business never to  tell people s names when they desire to be secret  he is a little out  of cash  just now  as you may suppose by his appearance  so instead of  buying books  he comes to sell them  however  he has taken a very good  road to bring himself home again  for we pay very handsomely for things  of any merit  especially if they deal smartly in a few touches of the  times      cecilia chose not to risk any further questions  lest her knowledge of  him should be suspected  but got into her chair  and returned to lady  margaret s     the sight of belfield reminded her not only of himself  the gentle  henrietta again took her place in her memory  whence her various  distresses and suspences had of late driven from it everybody but  delvile  and those whom delvile brought into it  but her regard for  that amiable girl  though sunk in the busy scenes of her calamitous  uncertainties  was only sunk in her own bosom  and ready  upon their  removal  to revive with fresh vigour  she was now indeed more unhappy  than even in the period of her forgetfulness  yet her mind  was no  longer filled with the restless turbulence of hope  which still more  than despondency unfitted it for thinking of others     this remembrance thus awakened  awakened also a desire of renewing the  connection so long neglected  all scruples concerning delvile had now  lost their foundation  since the doubts from which they arose were both  explained and removed  she was certain alike of his indifference to  henrietta  and his separation from herself  she knew that nothing was  to be feared from painful or offensive rivalry  and she resolved   therefore  to lose no time in seeking the first pleasure to which since  her disappointment she had voluntarily looked forward     early in the evening  she told lady margaret she was going out for  an hour or two  and sending again for a chair  was carried to  portland street     she enquired for miss belfield  and was shewn into a parlour  where she  found her drinking tea with her mother  and mr hobson  their landlord     henrietta almost screamed at her sight  from a sudden impulse of joy  and surprize  and  running up to her  flung her arms round her neck   and embraced her with the most rapturous emotion  but then  drawing  back with a look of timidity and shame  she bashfully apologized for  her freedom  saying   indeed  dearest miss beverley  it is no want  of respect  but i am so very glad to see you it makes me quite forget  myself      cecilia  charmed at a reception so ingenuously affectionate  soon  satisfied her doubting diffidence by the warmest thanks that she had  preserved so much regard for her  and by doubling the kindness with  which she returned her caresses      mercy on me  madam   cried mrs belfield  who during this time had  been busily employed in sweeping the hearth  wiping some slops upon the  table  and smoothing her handkerchief and apron   why the girl s enough  to smother you  henny  how can you be so troublesome  i never saw you  behave in this way before       miss beverley  madam   said henrietta  again retreating   is so kind as  to pardon me  and i was so much surprised at seeing her  that i hardly  knew what i was about       the young ladies  ma am   said mr hobson   have a mighty way of  saluting one another till such time as they get husbands  and then  i ll warrant you they can meet without any salutation at all  that s my  remark  at least  and what i ve seen of the world has set me upon making  it      this speech led cecilia to check  however artless  the tenderness of  her fervent young friend  whom she was much teized by meeting in such  company  but who seemed not to dare understand the frequent looks which  she gave her expressive of a wish to be alone with her      come  ladies   continued the facetious mr hobson   what if we were all  to sit down  and have a good dish of tea  and suppose  mrs belfield   you was to order us a fresh round of toast and butter  do you think the  young ladies here would have any objection  and what if we were to have  a little more water in the tea kettle  not forgetting a little more tea  in the teapot  what i say is this  let us all be comfortable  that s my  notion of things       and a very good notion too   said mrs belfield   for you who have  nothing to vex you  ah  ma am  you have heard  i suppose  about my son   gone off  nobody knows where  left that lord s house  where he might  have lived like a king  and gone out into the wide world nobody knows  for what       indeed   said cecilia  who  from seeing him in london concluded he was  again with his family   and has he not acquainted you where he is       no  ma am  no   cried mrs belfield   he s never once told me where  he is gone  nor let me know the least about the matter  for if i did i  would not taste a dish of tea again for a twelvemonth till i saw him get  back again to that lord s  and i believe in my heart there s never such  another in the three kingdoms  for he has sent here after him i dare say  a score of times  and no wonder  for i will take upon me to say he won t  find his fellow in a hurry  lord as he is       as to his being a lord   said mr hobson   i am one of them that lay no  great stress upon that  unless he has got a good long purse of his own   and then  to be sure  a lord s no bad thing  but as to the matter of  saying lord such a one  how d ye do  and lord such a one  what do you  want  and such sort of compliments  why in my mind  it s a mere nothing   in comparison of a good income  as to your son  ma am  he did not go  the right way to work  he should have begun with business  and gone into  pleasure afterwards and if he had but done that  i ll be bold to say we  might have had him at this very minute drinking tea with us over this  fireside       my son  sir   said mrs belfield  rather angrily   was another sort of  a person than a person of business  he always despised it from a child   and come of it what may  i am sure he was born to be a gentleman       as to his despising business   said mr hobson  very contemptuously    why so much the worse  for business is no such despiseable thing  and  if he had been brought up behind a counter  instead of dangling after  these same lords  why he might have had a house of his own over his  head  and been as good a man as myself       a house over his head   said mrs belfield   why he might have had what  he would  and have done what he would  if he had but followed my advice   and put himself a little forward  i have told him a hundred times to ask  some of those great people he lived amongst for a place at court  for i  know they ve so many they hardly know what to do with them  and it was  always my design from the beginning that he should be something of a  great man  but i never could persuade him  though  for anything i know   as i have often told him  if he had but had a little courage he might  have been an ambassador by this time  and now  all of a sudden  to be  gone nobody knows where         i am sorry  indeed   said cecilia  who knew not whether most to pity or  wonder at her blind folly   but i doubt not you will hear of him soon       as to being an ambassador  ma am   said mr hobson   it s talking quite  out of character  those sort of great people keep things of that kind  for their own poor relations and cousins  what i say is this  a man s  best way is to take care of himself  the more those great people see you  want them  the less they like your company  let every man be brought up  to business  and then when he s made his fortune  he may walk with his  hat on  why now there was your friend  ma am   turning to cecilia   that  shot out his brains without paying any body a souse  pray how was that  being more genteel than standing behind a counter  and not owing a  shilling       do you think a young lady   cried mrs belfield warmly   can bear to  hear of such a thing as standing behind a counter  i am sure if my son  had ever done it  i should not expect any lady would so much as look at  him  and yet  though i say it  she might look a good while  and not see  many such persons  let her look where she pleased  and then he has such  a winning manner into the bargain  that i believe in my heart there s  never a lady in the land could say no to him  and yet he has such a  prodigious shyness  i never could make him own he had so much as asked  the question  and what lady can begin first       why no   said mr hobson   that would be out of character another way   now my notion is this  let every man be agreeable  and then he may ask  what lady he pleases  and when he s a mind of a lady  he should look  upon a frown or two as nothing  for the ladies frown in courtship as a  thing of course  it s just like a man swearing at a coachman  why he s  not a bit more in a passion  only he thinks he sha n t be minded without  it       well  for my part   said mrs belfield   i am sure if i was a young  lady  and most especially if i was a young lady of fortune  and all  that  i should like a modest young gentleman  such as my son  for  example  better by half than a bold swearing young fellow  that would  make a point to have me whether i would or no       ha  ha  ha   cried mr hobson   but the young ladies are not of that  way of thinking  they are all for a little life and spirit  don t i say  right  young ladies      cecilia  who could not but perceive that these speeches was levelled at  herself  felt offended and tired  and finding she had no chance of any  private conversation with henrietta  arose to take leave  but while  she stopped in the passage to enquire when she could see her alone  a  footman knocked at the door  who  having asked if mr belfield lodged  there  and been answered in the affirmative  begged to know whether miss  beverley was then in the house     cecilia  much surprised  went forward  and told him who she was      i have been  madam   said he   with a message to you at mr monckton s   in soho square  but nobody knew where you was  and mr monckton came out  and spoke to me himself  and said that all he could suppose was that you  might be at this house  so he directed me to come here       and from whom  sir  is your message       from the honourable mr delvile  madam  in st james s square  he desires  to know if you shall be at home on saturday morning  the day after  to morrow  and whether you can appoint mr briggs to meet him by twelve  o clock exactly  as he sha n t be able to stay above three minutes      cecilia gave an answer as cold as the message  that she would be in  soho square at the time he mentioned  and acquaint mr briggs of his  intention     the footman then went away  and henrietta told her  that if she could  call some morning she might perhaps contrive to be alone with her  and  added   indeed i wish much to see you  if you could possibly do me so  great an honour  for i am very miserable  and have nobody to tell so   ah  miss beverley  you that have so many friends  and that deserve as  many again  you little know what a hard thing it is to have none   but  my brother s strange disappearing has half broke our hearts      cecilia was beginning a consolatory speech  in which she meant to  give her private assurances of his health and safety  when she was  interrupted by mr albany  who came suddenly into the passage     henrietta received him with a look of pleasure  and enquired why he  had so long been absent  but  surprised by the sight of cecilia  he  exclaimed  without answering her   why didst thou fail me  why  appoint me to a place thou wert quitting thyself   thou thing of fair  professions  thou inveigler of esteem  thou vain  delusive promiser of  pleasure       you condemn me too hastily   said cecilia   if i failed in my promise   it was not owing to caprice or insincerity  but to a real and bitter  misfortune which incapacitated me from keeping it  i shall soon   however   nay  i am already at your disposal  if you have any commands  for me       i have always   answered he   commands for the rich  for i have always  compassion for the poor       come to me  then  at mr monckton s in soho square   cried she  and  hastened into her chair  impatient to end a conference which she saw  excited the wonder of the servants  and which also now drew out from  the parlour mr hobson and mrs belfield  she then kissed her hand to  henrietta  and ordered the chairmen to carry her home     it had not been without difficulty that she had restrained herself from  mentioning what she knew of belfield  when she found his mother and  sister in a state of such painful uncertainty concerning him  but her  utter ignorance of his plans  joined to her undoubted knowledge of his  wish of concealment  made her fear doing mischief by officiousness   and think it wiser not to betray what she had seen of him  till better  informed of his own views and intentions  yet  willing to shorten a  suspence so uneasy to them  she determined to entreat mr monckton would  endeavour to find him out  and acquaint him with their anxiety     that gentleman  when she returned to his house  was in a state of mind  by no means enviable  missing her at tea  he had asked miss bennet where  she was  and hearing she had not left word  he could scarce conceal his  chagrin  knowing  however  how few were her acquaintances in town   he soon concluded she was with miss belfield  but  not satisfied with  sending mr delvile s messenger after her  he privately employed one  in whom he trusted for himself  to make enquiries at the house without  saying whence he came     but though this man was returned  and he knew her safety  he still felt  alarmed  he had flattered himself  from the length of time in which she  had now done nothing without consulting him  she would scarce even think  of any action without his previous concurrence  and he had hoped  by a  little longer use  to make his counsel become necessary  which he knew  to be a very short step from rendering it absolute     nor was he well pleased to perceive  by this voluntary excursion   a struggle to cast off her sadness  and a wish to procure herself  entertainment  it was not that he desired her misery  but he was earnest  that all relief from it should spring from himself  and though far from  displeased that delvile should lose his sovereignty over her thoughts   he was yet of opinion that  till his own liberty was restored  he had  less to apprehend from grief indulged  than grief allayed  one could  but lead her to repining retirement  the other might guide her to a  consolatory rival     he well knew  however  it was as essential to his cause to disguise his  disappointments as his expectations  and  certain that by pleasing  alone he had any chance of acquiring power  he cleared up when cecilia  returned  who as unconscious of feeling  as of owing any subjection to  him  preserved uncontrolled the right of acting for herself  however  desirous and glad of occasional instruction     she told him where she had been  and related her meeting belfield  and  the unhappiness of his friends  and hinted her wish that he could be  informed what they suffered  mr monckton  eager to oblige her  went  instantly in search of him  and returning to supper  told her he had  traced him through the bookseller  who had not the dexterity to parry  his artful enquiries  and had actually appointed him to breakfast in  soho square the next morning     he had found him  he said  writing  but in high spirits and good humour   he had resisted  for a while  his invitation on account of his dress   all his clothes but the very coat which he had on being packed up and  at his mother s  but  when laughed at by mr monckton for still  retaining some foppery  he gaily protested what remained of it should  be extinguished  and acknowledging that his shame was no part of his  philosophy  declared he would throw it wholly aside  and  in spite of  his degradation  renew his visits at his house      i would not tell him   mr monckton continued   of the anxiety of his  family  i thought it would come more powerfully from yourself  who   having seen  can better enforce it      cecilia was very thankful for this compliance with her request  and  anticipated the pleasure she hoped soon to give henrietta  by the  restoration of a brother so much loved and so regretted     she sent  mean time  to mr briggs the message she had received from mr  delvile  and had the satisfaction of an answer that he would observe the  appointment         chapter iii     a confabulation     the next morning  while the family was at breakfast  belfield  according  to his promise  made his visit     a high colour overspread his face as he entered the room  resulting from  a sensation of grief at his fallen fortune  and shame at his altered  appearance  which though he endeavoured to cover under an air of  gaiety and unconcern  gave an awkwardness to his manners  and a visible  distress to his countenance  mr monckton received him with pleasure  and  cecilia  who saw the conflict of his philosophy with his pride  dressed  her features once more in smiles  which however faint and heartless   shewed her desire to reassure him  miss bennet  as usual when not called  upon by the master or lady of the house  sat as a cypher  and lady  margaret  always disagreeable and repulsive to the friends of her  husband  though she was not now more than commonly ungracious  struck  the quick feeling and irritable belfield  to wear an air of rude  superiority meant to reproach him with his disgrace     this notion  which strongly affected him  made him  for one instant   hesitate whether he should remain another in the same room with her  but  the friendliness of mr monckton  and the gentleness and good breeding of  cecilia  seemed so studious to make amends for her moroseness  that he  checked his too ready indignation  and took his seat at the table  yet  was it some time before he could recover even the assumed vivacity which  this suspected insult had robbed him of  sufficiently to enter into  conversation with any appearance of ease or pleasure  but  after  a while  soothed by the attentions of cecilia and mr monckton  his  uneasiness wore off  and the native spirit and liveliness of his  character broke forth with their accustomed energy      this good company  i hope   said he  addressing himself  however  only  to cecilia   will not so much  mistake the thing  as to criticise my  dress of this morning  since it is perfectly according to rule  and to  rule established from time immemorial  but lest any of you should  so much err as to fancy shabby what is only characteristic  i must  endeavour to be beforehand with the malice of conjecture  and have the  honour to inform you  that i am enlisted in the grub street regiment  of  the third story  and under the tattered banner of scribbling volunteers   a race which  if it boasts not the courage of heroes  at least equals  them in enmity  this coat  therefore  is merely the uniform of my  corps  and you will all  i hope  respect it as emblematical of wit and  erudition       we must at least respect you   said cecilia   who thus gaily can sport  with it       ah  madam   said he  more seriously   it is not from you i ought  to look for respect  i must appear to you the most unsteady and  coward hearted of beings  but lately i blushed to see you from poverty   though more worthily employed than when i had been seen by you in  affluence  that shame vanquished  another equally narrow took its place   and yesterday i blushed again that you detected me in a new pursuit   though i had only quitted my former one from a conviction it was ill  chosen  there seems in human nature a worthlessness not to be conquered   yet i will struggle with it to the last  and either die in the attempt   or dare seem that which i am  without adding to the miseries of life   the sting  the envenomed sting of dastardly false shame       your language is wonderfully altered within this twelvemonth   said mr  monckton    the worthlessness of human nature   the  miseries of  life   this from you  so lately the champion of human nature  and the  panegyrist of human life       soured by personal disappointment   answered he   i may perhaps speak  with too much acrimony  yet  ultimately  my opinions have not much  changed  happiness is given to us with more liberality than we are  willing to confess  it is judgment only that is dealt us sparingly  and  of that we have so little  that when felicity is before us  we turn  to the right or left  or when at the right or left  we proceed strait  forward  it has been so with me  i have sought it at a distance  amidst  difficulty and danger  when all that i could wish has been immediately  within my grasp       it must be owned   said mr monckton   after what you have suffered from  this world you were wont to defend  there is little reason to wonder at  some change in your opinion       yet whatever have been my sufferings   he answered   i have generally  been involved in them by my own rashness or caprice  my last enterprise  especially  from which my expectations were highest  was the most  ill judged of any  i considered not how little my way of life had fitted  me for the experiment i was making  how irreparably i was enervated  by long sedentary habits  and how insufficient for bodily strength  was mental resolution  we may fight against partial prejudices  and by  spirit and fortitude we may overcome them  but it will not do to war  with the general tenor of education  we may blame  despise  regret as we  please  but customs long established  and habits long indulged  assume  an empire despotic  though their power is but prescriptive  opposing  them is vain  nature herself  when forced aside  is not more elastic in  her rebound       will you not then   said cecilia   since your experiment has failed   return again to your family  and to the plan of life you formerly  settled       you speak of them together   said he  with a smile   as if you thought  them inseparable  and indeed my own apprehension they would be  deemed so  has made me thus fear to see my friends  since i love not  resistance  yet cannot again attempt the plan of life they would have me  pursue  i have given up my cottage  but my independence is as dear to me  as ever  and all that i have gathered from experience  is to maintain  it by those employments for which my education has fitted me  instead of  seeking it injudiciously by the very road for which it has unqualified  me       and what is this independence   cried mr monckton   which has thus  bewitched your imagination  a mere idle dream of romance and enthusiasm   without existence in nature  without possibility in life  in uncivilised  countries  or in lawless times  independence  for a while  may perhaps  stalk abroad  but in a regular government   tis only the vision of a  heated brain  one part of a community must inevitably hang upon another   and  tis a farce to call either independent  when to break the chain by  which they are linked would prove destruction to both  the soldier wants  not the officer more than the officer the soldier  nor the tenant  the landlord  more than the landlord the tenant  the rich owe their  distinction  their luxuries  to the poor  as much as the poor owe their  rewards  their necessaries  to the rich       man treated as an automaton   answered belfield   and considered merely  with respect to his bodily operations  may indeed be called dependent   since the food by which he lives  or  rather  without which he  dies  cannot wholly be cultivated and prepared by his own hands  but  considered in a nobler sense  he deserves not the degrading epithet   speak of him  then  as a being of feeling and understanding  with pride  to alarm  with nerves to tremble  with honour to satisfy  and with a  soul to be immortal   as such  may he not claim the freedom of his own  thoughts  may not that claim be extended to the liberty of speaking   and the power of being governed by them  and when thoughts  words  and  actions are exempt from controul  will you brand him with dependency  merely because the grazier feeds his meat  and the baker kneads his  bread       but who is there in the whole world   said mr monckton   extensive  as it is  and dissimilar as are its inhabitants  that can pretend to  assert  his thoughts  words  and actions  are exempt from controul  even  where interest  which you so much disdain  interferes not   though where  that is i confess i cannot tell   are we not kept silent where we wish  to reprove by the fear of offending  and made speak where we wish to be  silent by the desire of obliging  do we not bow to the scoundrel as low  as to the man of honour  are we not by mere forms kept standing when  tired  made give place to those we despise  and smiles to those we hate   or if we refuse these attentions  are we not regarded as savages  and  shut out of society       all these   answered belfield   are so merely matters of ceremony  that  the concession can neither cost pain to the proud  nor give pleasure to  the vain  the bow is to the coat  the attention is to the rank  and the  fear of offending ought to extend to all mankind  homage such as this  infringes not our sincerity  since it is as much a matter of course as  the dress that we wear  and has as little reason to flatter a man as the  shadow which follows him  i no more  therefore  hold him deceitful for  not opposing this pantomimical parade  than i hold him to be dependent  for eating corn he has not sown       where  then  do you draw the line  and what is the boundary beyond  which your independence must not step       i hold that man   cried he  with energy   to be independent  who treats  the great as the little  and the little as the great  who neither exults  in riches nor blushes in poverty  who owes no man a groat  and who  spends not a shilling he has not earned       you will not  indeed  then  have a very numerous acquaintance  if this  is the description of those with whom you purpose to associate  but is  it possible you imagine you can live by such notions  why the carthusian  in his monastery  who is at least removed from temptation  is not  mortified so severely as a man of spirit living in the world  who would  prescribe himself such rules       not merely have i prescribed   returned belfield   i have already put  them in practice  and far from finding any pennance  i never before  found happiness  i have now adopted  though poor  the very plan of life  i should have elected if rich  my pleasure  therefore  is become my  business  and my business my pleasure       and is this plan   cried monckton   nothing more than turning  knight errant to the booksellers        tis a knight errantry   answered belfield  laughing   which  however  ludicrous it may seem to you  requires more soul and more brains than  any other  our giants may  indeed  be only windmills  but they must be  attacked with as much spirit  and conquered with as much bravery  as  any fort or any town  in time of war  to  be demolished  and though the  siege  i must confess  may be of less national utility  the assailants  of the quill have their honour as much at heart as the assailants of the  sword       i suppose then   said monckton  archly   if a man wants a biting  lampoon  or an handsome panegyric  some newspaper scandal  or a sonnet  for a lady        no  no   interrupted belfield eagerly   if you imagine me a hireling  scribbler for the purposes of defamation or of flattery  you as little  know my situation as my character  my subjects shall be my own  and my  satire shall be general  i would as much disdain to be personal with an  anonymous pen  as to attack an unarmed man in the dark with a dagger i  had kept concealed      a reply of rallying incredulity was rising to the lips of mr monckton   when reading in the looks of cecilia an entire approbation of this  sentiment  he checked his desire of ridicule  and exclaimed   spoken  like a man of honour  and one whose works may profit the world       from my earliest youth to the present hour   continued belfield    literature has been the favourite object of my pursuit  my recreation  in leisure  and my hope in employment  my propensity to it  indeed   has been so ungovernable  that i may properly call it the source of my  several miscarriages throughout life  it was the bar to my preferment   for it gave me a distaste to other studies  it was the cause of my  unsteadiness in all my undertakings  because to all i preferred it   it has sunk me to distress  it has involved me in difficulties  it  has brought me to the brink of ruin by making me neglect the means  of living  yet never  till now  did i discern it might itself be my  support       i am heartily glad  sir   said cecilia   your various enterprizes and  struggles have at length ended in a project which promises you so much  satisfaction  but you will surely suffer your sister and your mother  to partake of it  for who is there that your prosperity will make so  happy       you do them infinite honour  madam  by taking any interest in their  affairs  but to own to you the truth  what to me appears prosperity   will to them wear another aspect  they have looked forward to my  elevation with expectations the most improbable  and thought everything  within my grasp  with a simplicity incredible  but though their hopes  were absurd  i am pained by their disappointment  and i have not courage  to meet their tears  which i am sure will not be spared when they see  me        tis from tenderness  then   said cecilia  half smiling   that you are  cruel  and from affection to your friends that you make them believe you  have forgotten them      there was a delicacy in this reproach exactly suited to work upon  belfield  who feeling it with quickness  started up  and cried   i  believe i am wrong   i will go to them this moment      cecilia felt eager to second the generous impulse  but mr monckton   laughing at his impetuosity  insisted he should first finish his  breakfast      your friends   said cecilia   can have no mortification so hard to bear  as your voluntary absence  and if they see but that you are happy  they  will soon be reconciled to whatever situation you may chuse       happy   repeated he  with animation   oh i am in paradise  i am come  from a region in the first rude state of nature  to civilization and  refinement  the life i led at the cottage was the life of a savage  no  intercourse with society  no consolation from books  my mind locked up   every source dried of intellectual delight  and no enjoyment in my power  but from sleep and from food  weary of an existence which thus levelled  me with a brute  i grew ashamed of the approximation  and listening to  the remonstrance of my understanding  i gave up the precipitate plan  to  pursue one more consonant to reason  i came to town  hired a room  and  sent for pen  ink and paper  what i have written are trifles  but the  bookseller has not rejected them  i was settled  therefore  in a moment   and comparing my new occupation with that i had just quitted  i seemed  exalted on the sudden from a mere creature of instinct  to a rational  and intelligent being  but when first i opened a book  after so long  an abstinence from all mental nourishment   oh it was rapture  no  half famished beggar regaled suddenly with food  ever seized on his  repast with more hungry avidity       let fortune turn which way it will   cried monckton   you may defy all  its malice  while possessed of a spirit of enjoyment which nothing can  subdue       but were you not  sir   said cecilia   as great an enthusiast the other  day for your cottage  and for labour       i was  madam  but there my philosophy was erroneous  in my ardour  to fly from meanness and from dependence  i thought in labour and  retirement i should find freedom and happiness  but i forgot that my  body was not seasoned for such work  and considered not that a  mind which had once been opened by knowledge  could ill endure the  contraction of dark and perpetual ignorance  the approach  however  of  winter  brought me acquainted with my mistake  it grew cold  it grew  bleak  little guarded against the inclemency of the       i felt its  severity in every limb  and missed a thousand indulgencies which in  possession i had never valued  to rise at break of day  chill  freezing   and comfortless  no sun abroad  no fire at home  to go out in all  weather to work  that work rough  coarse  and laborious   unused to such  hardships  i found i could not bear them  and  however unwillingly  was  compelled to relinquish the attempt      breakfast now being over  he again arose to take leave      you are going  then  sir   said cecilia   immediately to your friends       no  madam   answered he hesitating   not just this moment  to morrow  morning perhaps   but it is now late  and i have business for the rest  of the day       ah  mr monckton   cried cecilia   what mischief have you done by  occasioning this delay       this goodness  madam   said belfield   my sister can never sufficiently  acknowledge  but i will own  that though  just now  in a warm moment  i  felt eager to present myself to her and my mother  i rather wish  now i  am cooler  to be saved the pain of telling them in person my situation   i mean  therefore  first to write to them       you will not fail  then  to see them to morrow       certainly  i think not       nay  but certainly you  must  not  for i shall call upon them to day   and assure them they may expect you  can i soften your task of writing  by giving them any message from you       ah  madam  have a care   cried he   this condescension to a poor author  may be more dangerous than you have any suspicion  and before you have  power to help yourself  you may see your name prefixed to the dedication  of some trumpery pamphlet       i will run   cried she   all risks  remember  therefore  you will be  responsible for the performance of my promise       i will be sure   answered he   not to forget what reflects so much  honour upon myself      cecilia was satisfied by this assent  and he then went away      a strange flighty character   cried mr monckton   yet of uncommon  capacity  and full of genius  were he less imaginative  wild and  eccentric  he has abilities for any station  and might fix and  distinguish himself almost where ever he pleased       i knew not   said cecilia   the full worth of steadiness and prudence  till i knew this young man  for he has every thing else  talents the  most striking  a love of virtue the most elevated  and manners the most  pleasing  yet wanting steadiness and prudence  he can neither act with  consistency nor prosper with continuance       he is well enough   said lady margaret  who had heard the whole  argument in sullen taciturnity   he is well enough  i say  and there  comes no good from young women s being so difficult      cecilia  offended by a speech which implied a rude desire to dispose  of her  went up stairs to her own room  and mr monckton  always enraged  when young men and cecilia were alluded to in the same sentence  retired  to his library     she then ordered a chair  and went to portland street  to fulfil what  she had offered to belfield  and to revive his mother and sister by the  pleasure of the promised interview     she found them together  and her intelligence being of equal consequence  to both  she did not now repine at the presence of mrs belfield   she made her communication with the most cautious attention to their  characters  softening the ill she had to relate with respect to  belfield s present way of living  by endeavouring to awaken affection  and joy from the prospect of the approaching meeting  she counselled  them as much as possible to restrain their chagrin at his misfortunes   which he would but construe into reproach of his ill management  and  she represented that when once he was restored to his family  he might  almost imperceptibly be led into some less wild and more profitable  scheme of business     when she had told all she thought proper to relate  kindly interspersing  her account with the best advice and best comfort she could suggest   she made an end of her visit  for the affliction of mrs belfield  upon hearing the actual situation of her son  was so clamorous and  unappeaseable  that  little wondering at belfield s want of courage to  encounter it  and having no opportunity in such a storm to console the  soft henrietta  whose tears flowed abundantly that her brother should  thus be fallen  she only promised before she left town to see her again   and beseeching mrs belfield to moderate her concern  was glad to leave  the house  where her presence had no power to quiet their distress     she passed the rest of the day in sad reflections upon the meeting  she was herself to have the next morning with mr delvile  she wished  ardently to know whether his son was gone abroad  and whether mrs  delvile was recovered  whose health  in her own letter  was mentioned in  terms the most melancholy  yet neither of these enquiries could she even  think of making  since reasonably  without them  apprehensive of some  reproach         chapter iv     a wrangling     mr monckton  the next day  as soon as breakfast was over  went out   to avoid showing  even to cecilia  the anxiety he felt concerning the  regulation of her fortune  and arrangement of her affairs  he strongly   however  advised her not to mention her large debt  which  though  contracted in the innocence of the purest benevolence  would incur  nothing but reproof and disapprobation  from all who only heard of it   when they heard of its inutility     at eleven o clock  though an hour before the time appointed  while  cecilia was sitting in lady margaret s dressing room   with sad civility  and an aching head   she was summoned to mr briggs in the parlour     he immediately began reproaching her with having eloped from him  in the  summer  and with the various expences she had caused him from useless  purchases and spoilt provisions  he then complained of mr delvile  whom  he charged with defrauding him of his dues  but observing in the midst  of his railing her dejection of countenance  he suddenly broke off  and  looking at her with some concern  said   what s the matter  ducky  a n t  well  look as if you could not help it       o yes   cried cecilia   i thank you  sir  i am very well       what do you look so blank for  then   said he   bay  what are fretting  for   crossed in love   lost your sweetheart       no  no  no   cried she  with quickness      never mind  my chick  never mind   said he  pinching her cheek  with  resumed good humour   more to be had  if one won t snap  another will   put me in a passion by going off from me with that old grandee  or would  have got one long ago  hate that old don  used me very ill  wish i could  trounce him  thinks more of a fusty old parchment than the price of  stocks  fit for nothing but to be stuck upon an old monument for a  death s head      he then told her that her accounts were all made out  and he was ready  at any time to produce them  he approved much of her finishing wholly  with the  old don   who had been a mere cypher in the executorship  but  he advised her not to think of taking her money into her own hands  as  he was willing to keep the charge of it himself till she was married     cecilia  thanking him for the offer  said she meant now to make her  acknowledgments for all the trouble he had already taken  but by no  means purposed to give him any more     he debated the matter with her warmly  told her she had no chance to  save herself from knaves and cheats  but by trusting to nobody but  himself  and informing her what interest he had already made of her  money  enquired how she would set about getting more     cecilia  though prejudiced against him by mr monckton  knew not how to  combat his arguments  yet conscious that scarce any part of the money  to which he alluded was in fact her own  she could not yield to them   he was  however  so stubborn and so difficult to deal with  that she at  length let him talk without troubling herself to answer  and privately  determined to beg mr monckton would fight her battle     she was not  therefore  displeased by his interruption  though very much  surprised by the sight of his person  when  in the midst of mr briggs s  oratory  mr hobson entered the parlour      i ask pardon  ma am   cried he   if i intrude  but i made free to call  upon the account of two ladies that are acquaintances of yours  that are  quite  as one may say  at their wit s ends       what is the matter with them  sir       why  ma am  no great matter  but mothers are soon frightened  and when  once they are upon the fret  one may as well talk to the boards  they  know no more of reasoning and arguing  than they do of a shop ledger   however  my maxim is this  every body in their way  one has no more  right to expect courageousness from a lady in them cases  than one has  from a child in arms  for what i say is  they have not the proper use of  their heads  which makes it very excusable       but what has occasioned any alarm  nothing  i hope  is the matter with  miss belfield       no  ma am  thank god  the young lady enjoys her health very well  but  she is taking on just in the same way as her mamma  as what can be more  natural  example  ma am  is apt to be catching  and one lady s crying  makes another think she must do the same  for a little thing serves for  a lady s tears  being they can cry at any time  but a man is quite of  another nature  let him but have a good conscience  and be clear of the  world  and i ll engage he ll not wash his face without soap  that s what  i say       will  will   cried mr briggs   do it myself  never use soap  nothing  but waste  take a little sand  does as well       let every man have his own proposal   answered hobson   for my part  i  take every morning a large bowl of water  and souse my whole head in it   and then when i ve rubbed it dry  on goes my wig  and i am quite fresh  and agreeable  and then i take a walk in tottenham court road as far as  the tabernacle  or thereabouts  and snuff in a little fresh country  air  and then i come back  with a good wholesome appetite  and in a fine  breathing heat  asking the young lady s pardon  and i enjoy my pot of  fresh tea  and my round of hot toast and butter  with as good a relish  as if i was a prince       pot of fresh tea   cried briggs   bring a man to ruin  toast and  butter  never suffer it in my house  breakfast on water gruel  sooner  done  fills one up in a second  give it my servants  can t eat much of  it  bob  em there   nodding significantly      water gruel   exclaimed mr hobson   why i could not get it down if i  might have the world for it  it would make me quite sick  asking the  young lady s pardon  by reason i should always think i was preparing for  the small pox  my notion is quite of another nature  the first thing i  do is to have a good fire  for what i say is this  if a man is cold in  his fingers  it s odds if ever he gets warm in his purse  ha  ha  warm   you take me  sir  i mean a pun  though i ought to ask pardon  for i  suppose the young lady don t know what i am a saying       i should indeed be better pleased  sir   said cecilia   to hear what  you have to say about miss belfield       why  ma am  the thing is this  we have been expecting the young   squire  as i call him  all the morning  and he has never come  so mrs  belfield  not knowing where to send after him  was of opinion he might  be here  knowing your kindness to him  and that       you make the enquiry at the wrong place  sir   said cecilia  much  provoked by the implication it conveyed   if mr belfield is in this  house  you must seek him with mr monckton       you take no offence  i hope  ma am  at my just asking of the question   for mrs belfield crying  and being in that dilemma  i thought i could  do no less than oblige her by coming to see if the young gentleman was  here       what s this  what s this   cried mr briggs eagerly   who are talking  of  hay   who do mean  is this the sweet heart  eh  duck       no  no  sir   cried cecilia      no tricks  won t be bit  who is it  will know  tell me  i say        i ll  tell sir   cried mr hobson   it s a very handsome young  gentleman  with as fine a person  and as genteel a way of behaviour  and  withal  as pretty a manner of dressing himself  and that  as any lady  need desire  he has no great head for business  as i am told  but the  ladies don t stand much upon that topic  being they know nothing of it  themselves       has got the ready   cried mr briggs  impatiently   can cast an account   that s the point  can come down handsomely  eh       why as to that  sir  i m not bound to speak to a gentleman s private  affairs  what s my own  is my own  and what is another person s  is  another person s  that s my way of arguing  and that s what i call  talking to the purpose       dare say he s a rogue  don t have him  chick  bet a wager i n t  worth two shillings  and that will go for powder and pomatum  hate a  plaistered pate  commonly a numscull  love a good bob jerom       why this is talking quite wide of the mark   said mr hobson   to  suppose a young lady of fortunes would marry a man with a bob jerom   what i say is  let every body follow their nature  that s the way to be  comfortable  and then if they pay every one his own  who s a right to  call  em to account  whether they wear a bob jerom  or a pig tail down  to the calves of their legs       ay  ay   cried briggs  sneeringly   or whether they stuff their gullets  with hot rounds of toast and butter       and what if they do  sir   returned hobson  a little angrily   when a  man s got above the world  where s the harm of living a little genteel   as to a round of toast and butter  and a few oysters  fresh opened  by  way of a damper before dinner  no man need be ashamed of them  provided  he pays as he goes  and as to living upon water gruel  and scrubbing  one s flesh with sand  one might as well be a galley slave at once  you  don t understand life  sir  i see that       do  do   cried briggs  speaking through his shut teeth   you re out  there  oysters   come to ruin  tell you  bring you to jail       to jail  sir   exclaimed hobson   this is talking quite ungenteel  let  every man be civil  that s what i say  for that s the way to make every  thing agreeable but as to telling a man he ll go to jail  and that  it s  tantamount to affronting him      a rap at the street door gave now a new relief to cecilia  who began to  grow very apprehensive lest the delight of spending money  thus warmly  contested with that of hoarding it  should give rise to a quarrel   which  between two such sturdy champions for their own opinions  might  lead to a conclusion rather more rough and violent than she desired to  witness  but when the parlour door opened  instead of mr delvile  whom  she now fully expected  mr albany made his entrance     this was rather distressing  as her real business with her guardians  made it proper her conference with them should be undisturbed  and  albany was not a man with whom a hint that she was engaged could be  risked  but she had made no preparation to guard against interruption   as her little acquaintance in london had prevented her expecting any  visitors     he advanced with a solemn air to cecilia  and  looking as if hardly  determined whether to speak with severity or gentleness  said   once  more i come to prove thy sincerity  now wilt thou go with me where  sorrow calls thee  sorrow thy charity can mitigate       i am very much concerned   she answered   but indeed at present it is  utterly impossible       again   cried he  with a look at once stern and disappointed   again  thou failest me  what wanton trifling  why shouldst thou thus elate a  worn out mind  only to make it feel its lingering credulity  or why   teaching me to think i had found an angel  so unkindly undeceive me       indeed   said cecilia  much affected by this reproof   if you knew how  heavy a loss i had personally suffered        i do know it   cried he   and i grieved for thee when i heard it  thou  hast lost a faithful old friend  a loss which with every setting sun  thou mayst mourn  for the rising sun will never repair it  but was that  a reason for shunning the duties of humanity  was the sight of death a  motive for neglecting the claims of benevolence  ought it not rather to  have hastened your fulfilling them  and should not your own suffering  experience of the brevity of life  have taught you the vanity of all  things but preparing for its end       perhaps so  but my grief at that time made me think only of myself       and of what else dost thou think now       most probably of the same person still   said she  half smiling   but  yet believe me  i have real business to transact       frivolous  unmeaning  ever ready excuses  what business is so important  as the relief of a fellow creature       i shall not  i hope  there   answered she  with alacrity   be backward   but at least for this morning i must beg to make you my almoner      she then took out her purse     mr briggs and mr hobson  whose quarrel had been suspended by the  appearance of a third person  and who had stood during this short  dialogue in silent amazement  having first lost their anger in their  mutual consternation  now lost their consternation in their mutual  displeasure mr  hobson felt offended to hear business spoken of  slightly  and mr briggs felt enraged at the sight of cecilia s ready  purse  neither of them  however  knew which way to interfere  the  stem gravity of albany  joined to a language too lofty for their  comprehension  intimidating them both  they took  however  the relief of  communing with one another  and mr hobson said in a whisper  this  you  must know  is  i am told  a very particular old gentleman  quite what i  call a genius  he comes often to my house  to see my lodger miss henny  belfield  though i never happen to light upon him myself  except once in  the passage  but what i hear of him is this  he makes a practice  as  one may say  of going about into people s houses  to do nothing but find  fault       shan t get into mine   returned briggs   promise him that  don t half  like him  be bound he s an old sharper      cecilia  mean time  enquired what he desired to have      half a guinea   he answered      will that do       for those who have nothing   said he   it is much  hereafter  you may  assist them again  go but and see their distresses  and you will wish to  give them every thing      mr briggs now  when actually between her fingers he saw the half  guinea  could contain no longer  he twitched the sleeve of her gown  and  pinching her arm  with a look of painful eagerness  said in a whisper   don t give it  don t let him have it  chouse him  chouse him  nothing  but an old bite       pardon me  sir   said cecilia  in a low voice   his character is very  well known to me   and then  disengaging her arm from him  she presented  her little offering     at this sight  mr briggs was almost outrageous  and losing in his wrath   all fear of the stranger  he burst forth with fury into the following  outcries   be ruined  see it plainly  be fleeced  be stript  be robbed   won t have a gown to your back  won t have a shoe to your foot  won t  have a rag in the world  be a beggar in the street  come to the parish   rot in a jail   half a guinea at a time   enough to break the great  mogul       inhuman spirit of selfish parsimony   exclaimed albany   repinest thou  at this loan  given from thousands to those who have worse than nothing   who pay to day in hunger for bread they borrowed yesterday from pity   who to save themselves from the deadly pangs of famine  solicit but what  the rich know not when they possess  and miss not when they give       anan   cried briggs  recovering his temper from the perplexity of  his understanding  at a discourse to which his ears were wholly  unaccustomed   what d ye say       if to thyself distress may cry in vain   continued albany   if thy own  heart resists the suppliant s prayer  callous to entreaty  and hardened  in the world  suffer  at least  a creature yet untainted  who melts  at sorrow  and who glows with charity  to pay from her vast wealth a  generous tax of thankfulness  that fate has not reversed her doom  and  those whom she relieves  relieve not her       anan   was again all the wondering mr briggs could say      pray  ma am   said mr hobson  to cecilia   if it s no offence  was the  gentleman ever a player       i fancy not  indeed       i ask pardon  then  ma am  i mean no harm  but my notion was the  gentleman might be speaking something by heart       is it but on the stage  humanity exists   cried albany  indignantly    oh thither hasten  then  ye monopolizers of plenty  ye selfish   unfeeling engrossers of wealth  which ye dissipate without enjoying   and of abundance  which ye waste while ye refuse to distribute  thither   thither haste  if there humanity exists       as to engrossing   said mr hobson  happy to hear at last a word with  which he was familiar   it s what i never approved myself  my maxim is  this  if a man makes a fair penny  without any underhand dealings  why  he has as much a title to enjoy his pleasure as the chief justice  or  the lord chancellor  and it s odds but he s as happy as a greater man   though what i hold to be best of all  is a clear conscience  with a neat  income of   or      a year  that s my notion  and i don t think it s a  bad one       weak policy of short sighted ignorance   cried albany   to wish for  what  if used  brings care  and if neglected  remorse  have you not now  beyond what nature craves  why then still sigh for more       why   cried mr briggs  who by dint of deep attention began now better  to comprehend him   why to buy in  to be sure  ever hear of stocks  eh   know any thing of money       still to make more and more   cried albany   and wherefore  to spend in  vice and idleness  or hoard in chearless misery  not to give succour  to the wretched  not to support the falling  all is for self   however little wanted  all goes to added stores  or added luxury  no  fellow creature served  nor even one beggar relieved       glad of it   cried briggs   glad of it  would not have  em relieved   don t like  em  hate a beggar  ought to be all whipt  live upon  spunging       why as to a beggar  i must needs say   cried mr hobson   i am by no  means an approver of that mode of proceeding  being i take  em all for  cheats  for what i say is this  what a man earns  he earns  and it s no  man s business to enquire what he spends  for a free born englishman is  his own master by the nature of the law  and as to his being a subject   why a duke is no more  nor a judge  nor the lord high chancellor  and  the like of those  which makes it tantamount to nothing  being he is  answerable to nobody by the right of magna charta  except in cases of  treason  felony  and that  but as to a beggar  it s quite another thing   he comes and asks me for money  but what has he to shew for it  what  does he bring me in exchange  why a long story that he i n t worth a  penny  what s that to me  nothing at all  let every man have his own   that s my way of arguing       ungentle mortals   cried albany   in wealth exulting  even in  inhumanity  think you these wretched outcasts have less sensibility  than yourselves  think you  in cold and hunger  they lose those feelings  which even in voluptuous prosperity from time to time disturb you  you  say they are all cheats   tis but the niggard cant of avarice  to lure  away remorse from obduracy  think you the naked wanderer begs from  choice  give him your wealth and try       give him a whip   cried briggs   sha n t have a souse  send him to  bridewell  nothing but a pauper  hate  em  hate  em all  full of tricks   break their own legs  put out their arms  cut off their fingers  snap  their own ancles   all for what  to get at the chink  to chouse us of  cash  ought to be well flogged  have  em all sent to the thames  worse  than the convicts       poor subterfuge of callous cruelty  you cheat yourselves  to shun the  fraud of others  and yet  how better do you use the wealth so guarded   what nobler purpose can it answer to you  than even a chance to snatch  some wretch from sinking  think less how  much  ye save  and more  for  what   and then consider how thy full coffers may hereafter make  reparation  for the empty catalogue of thy virtues       anan   said mr briggs  again lost in perplexity and wonder      oh yet   continued albany  turning towards cecilia   preach not here  the hardness which ye practice  rather amend yourselves than corrupt  her  and give with liberality what ye ought to receive with gratitude       this is not my doctrine   cried hobson   i am not a near man  neither   but as to giving at that rate  it s quite out of character  i have as  good a right to my own savings  as to my own gettings  and what i say  is this  who ll give to  me   let me see that  and it s quite another  thing  and begin who will  i ll be bound to go on with him  pound for  pound  or pence for pence  but as to giving to them beggars  it s what  i don t approve  i pay the poor s rate  and that s what i call charity  enough for any man  but for the matter of living well  and spending  one s money handsomely  and having one s comforts about one  why it s a  thing of another nature  and i can say this for myself  and that is   i never grudged myself any thing in my life  i always made myself  agreeable  and lived on the best  that s my way       bad way too   cried briggs   never get on with it  never see beyond  your nose  won t be worth a plum while your head wags   then  taking  cecilia apart   hark ee  my duck   he added  pointing to albany   who is  that mr bounce  eh  what is he       i have known him but a short time  sir  but i think of him very  highly       is he a  good  man  that s the point  is he a  good  man       indeed he appears to me uncommonly benevolent and charitable       but that i n t the thing  is he  warm   that s the point  is he   warm        if you mean  passionate    said cecilia   i believe the energy of his  manner is merely to enforce what he says       don t take me  don t take me   cried he  impatiently   can come down  with the ready  that s the matter  can chink the little gold boys  eh       why i rather fear not by his appearance  but i know nothing of his  affairs       what does come for  eh  come a courting       mercy on me  no       what for then  only a spunging       no  indeed  he seems to have no wish but to assist and plead for  others       all fudge  think he i n t touched  ay  ay  nothing but a trick  only to  get at the chink  see he s as poor as a rat  talks of nothing but giving  money  a bad sign  if he d got any  would not do it  wanted to make  us come down  warrant thought to bam us all  out there  a n t so soon  gulled      a knock at the street door gave now a new interruption  and mr delvile  at length appeared     cecilia  whom his sight could not fail to disconcert  felt doubly  distressed by the unnecessary presence of albany and hobson  she  regretted the absence of mr monckton  who could easily have taken them  away  for though without scruple she could herself have acquainted mr  hobson she had business  she dreaded offending albany  whose esteem she  was ambitious of obtaining     mr delvile entered the room with an air stately and erect  he took off  his hat  but deigned not to make the smallest inclination of his head   nor offered any excuse to mr briggs for being past the hour of his  appointment  but having advanced a few paces  without looking either  to the right or left  said   as i have never acted  my coming may not   perhaps  be essential  but as my name is in the dean s will  and i have  once or twice met the other executors mentioned in it  i think it a duty  i owe to my own heirs to prevent any possible future enquiry or trouble  to them      this speech was directly addressed to no one  though meant to be  attended to by every one  and seemed proudly uttered as a mere apology  to himself for not having declined the meeting     cecilia  though she recovered from her confusion by the help of her  aversion to this self sufficiency  made not any answer  albany retired  to a corner of the room  mr hobson began to believe it was time for him  to depart  and mr briggs thinking only of the quarrel in which he had  separated with mr delvile in the summer  stood swelling with venom   which he longed for an opportunity to spit out     mr delvile  who regarded this silence as the effect of his awe inspiring  presence  became rather more complacent  but casting his eyes round the  room  and perceiving the two strangers  he was visibly surprised  and  looking at cecilia for some explanation  seemed to stand suspended from  the purpose of his visit till he heard one     cecilia  earnest to have the business concluded  turned to mr briggs   and said   sir  here is pen and ink  are you to write  or am i  or what  is to be done       no  no   said he  with a sneer   give it t other  all in our turn   don t come before his grace the right honourable mr vampus       before whom  sir   said mr delvile  reddening      before my lord don pedigree   answered briggs  with a spiteful grin    know him  eh  ever hear of such a person      mr delvile coloured still deeper  but turning contemptuously from him   disdained making any reply     mr briggs  who now regarded him as a defeated man  said exultingly to mr  hobson   what do stand here for   hay   fall o  your marrowbones  don t  see  squire high and mighty       as to falling on my marrowbones   answered mr hobson   it s what i  shall do to no man  except he was the king himself  or the like of that   and going to make me chancellor of the exchequer  or commissioner of  excise  not that i mean the gentleman any offence  but a man s a man   and for one man to worship another is quite out of law       must  must   cried briggs   tell all his old grand dads else  keeps  em  in a roll  locks  em in a closet  says his prayers to  em  can t live  without  em  likes  em better than cash   wish had  em here  pop  em all  in the sink       if your intention  sir   cried mr delvile  fiercely   is only to insult  me  i am prepared for what measures i shall take  i declined seeing you  in my own house  that i might not be under the same restraint as when it  was my unfortunate lot to meet you last       who cares   cried briggs  with an air of defiance   what can do  eh   poke me into a family vault  bind me o  top of an old monument  tie  me to a stinking carcase  make a corpse of me  and call it one of your  famous cousins         for heaven s sake  mr briggs   interrupted cecilia  who saw that mr  delvile  trembling with passion  scarce refrained lifting up his stick    be appeased  and let us finish our business      albany now  hearing in cecilia s voice the alarm with which she was  seized  came forward and exclaimed   whence this unmeaning dissension   to what purpose this irritating abuse  oh vain and foolish  live ye so  happily  last ye so long  that time and peace may thus be trifled with       there  there   cried briggs  holding up his finger at mr delvile   have  it now  got old mr bounce upon you  give you enough of it  promise you  that       restrain   continued albany   this idle wrath  and if ye have ardent  passions  employ them to nobler uses  let them stimulate acts of virtue   let them animate deeds of beneficence  oh waste not spirits that may  urge you to good  lead you to honour  warm you to charity  in poor and  angry words  in unfriendly  unmanly debate      mr delvile  who from the approach of albany  had given him his whole  attention  was struck with astonishment at this address  and almost  petrified with wonder at his language and exhortations      why i must own   said mr hobson   as to this matter i am much of the  same mind myself  for quarreling s a thing i don t uphold  being it  advances one no way  for what i say is this  if a man gets the better   he s only where he was before  and if he gets worsted  why it s odds but  the laugh s against him  so  if i may make bold to give my verdict  i  would have one of these gentlemen take the other by the hand  and so  put an end to bad words  that s my maxim  and that s what i call being  agreeable      mr delvile  at the words  one of these gentlemen take the other by the  hand   looked scornfully upon mr hobson  with a frown that expressed his  highest indignation  at being thus familiarly coupled with mr briggs   and then  turning from him to cecilia  haughtily said   are these  two persons   pointing towards albany and hobson   waiting here to be  witnesses to any transaction       no  sir  no   cried hobson   i don t mean to intrude  i am going  directly  so you can give me no insight  ma am   addressing cecilia   as  to where i might light upon mr belfield       me  no   cried she  much provoked by observing that mr delvile suddenly  looked at her      well  ma am  well  i mean no harm  only i hold it that the right way to  hear of a young gentleman  is to ask for him of a young lady  that s my  maxim  come  sir   to mr briggs   you and i had like to have fallen out   but what i say is this  let no man bear malice  that s my way  so i hope  we part without ill blood       ay  ay   said mr briggs  giving him a nod      well  then   added hobson   i hope the good will may go round  and that  not only you and i  but these two good old gentlemen will also lend a  hand      mr delvile now was at a loss which way to turn for very rage  but after  looking at every one with a face flaming with ire  he said to cecilia    if you have collected together these persons for the purpose of  affronting me  i must beg you to remember i am not one to be affronted  with impunity      cecilia  half frightened  was beginning an answer that disclaimed any  such intention  when albany  with the most indignant energy  called out    oh pride of heart  with littleness of soul  check this vile arrogance   too vain for man  and spare to others some part of that lenity thou  nourishest for thyself  or justly bestow on thyself that contempt thou  nourishest for others      and with these words he sternly left the house     the thunderstruck mr delvile began now to fancy that all the demons  of torment were designedly let loose upon him  and his surprise and  resentment operated so powerfully that it was only in broken sentences  he could express either   very extraordinary   a new method of  conduct   liberties to which i am not much used   impertinences i shall  not hastily forget   treatment that would scarce be pardonable to a  person wholly unknown         why indeed  sir   said hobson   i can t but say it was rather a cut up   but the old gentleman is what one may call a genius  which makes it a  little excusable  for he does things all his own way  and i am told it s  the same thing who he speaks to  so he can but find fault  and that       sir   interrupted the still more highly offended mr delvile   what   you  may be told is extremely immaterial to  me   and i must take the  liberty to hint to you  a conversation of this easy kind is not what i  am much in practice in hearing       sir  i ask pardon   said hobson   i meant nothing but what was  agreeable  however  i have done  and i wish you good day  your humble  servant  ma am  and i hope  sir   to mr briggs   you won t begin bad  words again       no  no   said briggs   ready to make up  all at end  only don t much  like  spain   that s all   winking significantly   nor a n t over fond  of a  skeleton       mr hobson now retired  and mr delvile and mr briggs  being both wearied  and both in haste to have done  settled in about five minutes all for  which they met  after passing more than an hour in agreeing what that  was     mr briggs then  saying he had an engagement upon business  declined  settling his own accounts till another time  but promised to see cecilia  again soon  and added   be sure take care of that old mr bounce  cracked  in the noddle  see that with half an eye  better not trust him  break  out some day  do you a mischief      he then went away  but while the parlour door was still open  to the no  little surprise of cecilia  the servant announced mr belfield  he hardly  entered the room  and his countenance spoke haste and eagerness   i have  this moment  madam   he said   been informed a complaint has been lodged  against me here  and i could not rest till i had the honour of assuring  you  that though i have been rather dilatory  i have not neglected my  appointment  nor has the condescension of your interference been thrown  away      he then bowed  shut the door  and ran off cecilia  though happy to  understand by this speech that he was actually restored to his family   was sorry at these repeated intrusions in the presence of mr delvile   who was now the only one that remained     she expected every instant that he would ring for his chair  which he  kept in waiting  but  after a pause of some continuance  to her equal  surprise and disturbance  he made the following speech   as it is  probable i am now for the last time alone with you  ma am  and as it is  certain we shall meet no more upon business  i cannot  in justice to my  own character  and to the respect i retain for the memory of the dean   your uncle  take a final leave of the office with which he was pleased  to invest me  without first fulfilling my own ideas of the duty it  requires from me  by giving you some counsel relating to your future  establishment      this was not a preface much to enliven cecilia  it prepared her for such  speeches as she was least willing to hear  and gave to her the mixt and  painful sensation of spirits depressed  with ride alarmed      my numerous engagements   he continued   and the appropriation of my  time  already settled  to their various claims  must make me brief in  what i have to represent  and somewhat  perhaps  abrupt in coming to the  purpose  but that you will excuse      cecilia disdained to humour this arrogance by any compliments or  concessions  she was silent  therefore  and when they were both seated   he went on      you are now at a time of life when it is natural for young women to  wish for some connection  and the largeness of your fortune will remove  from you such difficulties as prove bars to the pretensions  in this  expensive age  of those who possess not such advantages  it would have  been some pleasure to me  while i yet considered you as my ward  to have  seen you properly disposed of  but as that time is past  i can only give  you some general advice  which you may follow or neglect as you think  fit  by giving it  i shall satisfy myself  for the rest  i am not  responsible      he paused  but cecilia felt less and less inclination to make use of the  opportunity by speaking in her turn      yet though  as i just now hinted  young women of large fortunes may  have little trouble in finding themselves establishments  they ought  not  therefore  to trifle when proper ones are in their power  nor to  suppose themselves equal to any they may chance to desire      cecilia coloured high at this pointed reprehension  but feeling her  disgust every moment encrease  determined to sustain herself with  dignity  and at least not suffer him to perceive the triumph of his  ostentation and rudeness      the proposals   he continued   of the earl of ernolf had always my  approbation  it was certainly an ill judged thing to neglect such an  opportunity of being honourably settled  the clause of the name was  to   him   immaterial  since his own name half a century ago was unheard of   and since he is himself only known by his title  he is still  however   i have authority to acquaint you  perfectly well disposed to renew his  application to you       i am sorry  sir   said cecilia coldly   to hear it       you have  perhaps  some other better offer in view       no  sir   cried she  with spirit   nor even in desire       am i  then  to infer that some inferior offer has more chance of your  approbation       there is no reason  sir  to infer any thing  i am content with my  actual situation  and have  at present  neither prospect nor intention  of changing it       i perceive  but without surprise  your unwillingness to discuss  the subject  nor do i mean to press it  i shall merely offer to your  consideration one caution  and then relieve you from my presence  young  women of ample fortunes  who are early independent  are sometimes apt  to presume they may do every thing with impunity  but they are mistaken   they are as liable to censure as those who are wholly unprovided for       i hope  sir   said cecilia  staring   this at least is a caution rather  drawn from my situation than my behaviour       i mean not  ma am  narrowly to go into  or investigate the subject   what i have said you may make your own use of  i have only to observe  further  that when young women  at your time of life  are at all  negligent of so nice a thing as reputation  they commonly live to repent  it      he then arose to go  but cecilia  not more offended than amazed  said    i must beg  sir  you will explain yourself       certainly this matter   he answered   must be immaterial to  me   yet   as i have once been your guardian by the nomination of the dean  your uncle  i cannot forbear making an effort towards preventing any  indiscretion  and frequent visits to a young man        good god  sir   interrupted cecilia   what is it you mean       it can certainly  as i said before  be nothing to  me   though i should  be glad to see you in better hands  but i cannot suppose you have been  led to take such steps without some serious plan  and i would advise  you  without loss of time  to think better of what you are about       should i think  sir  to eternity   cried cecilia   i could never  conjecture what you mean       you may not chuse   said he  proudly   to understand me  but i have  done  if it had been in my power to have interfered in your service with  my lord derford  notwithstanding my reluctance to being involved in any  fresh employment  i should have made a point of not refusing it  but  this young man is nobody   a very imprudent connection        what young man  sir       nay   i  know nothing of him  it is by no means likely i should  but as  i had already been informed of your attention to him  the corroborating  incidents of my servant s following you to his house  his friend s  seeking him at yours  and his own waiting upon you this morning  were  not well calculated to make me withdraw my credence to it       is it  then  mr belfield  sir  concerning whom you draw these  inferences  from circumstances the most accidental and unmeaning       it is by no means my practice   cried he  haughtily  and with evident  marks of high displeasure at this speech   to believe any thing lightly   or without even unquestionable authority  what once  therefore  i have  credited  i do not often find erroneous  mistake not  however  what i  have said into supposing i have any objection to your marrying  on the  contrary  it had been for the honour of my family had you been married a  year ago i should not then have suffered the degradation of seeing a son  of the first expectations in the kingdom upon the point of renouncing  his birth  nor a woman of the first distinction ruined in her health   and broken for ever in her constitution      the emotions of cecilia at this speech were too powerful for  concealment  her colour varied  now reddening with indignation  now  turning pale with apprehension  she arose  she trembled and sat down   she arose again  but not knowing what to say or what to do  again sat  down     mr delvile then  making a stiff bow  wished her good morning      go not so  sir   cried she  in faltering accents   let me at least  convince you of the mistake with regard to mr belfield        my mistakes  ma am   said he  with a contemptuous smile   are perhaps  not easily convicted  and i may possibly labour under others that  would give you no less trouble  it may therefore be better to avoid any  further disquisition       no  not better   answered she  again recovering her courage from this  fresh provocation   i fear no disquisition  on the contrary  it is my  interest to solicit one       this intrepidity in a young woman   said he  ironically   is certainly  very commendable  and doubtless  as you are your own mistress  your  having run out great part of your fortune  is nothing beyond what you  have a right to do       me   cried cecilia  astonished   run out great part of my fortune       perhaps that is another  mistake   i have not often been so  unfortunate  and you are not  then  in debt       in debt  sir       nay  i have no intention to inquire into your affairs  good morning to  you  ma am       i beg  i entreat  sir  that you will stop   make me  at least   understand what you mean  whether you deign to hear my justification or  not       o  i am mistaken  it seems  misinformed  deceived  and you have neither  spent more than you have received  nor taken up money of jews  your  minority has been clear of debts  and your fortune  now you are of age   will be free from incumbrances      cecilia  who now began to understand him  eagerly answered   do you  mean  sir  the money which i took up last spring       o no  by no means  i conceive the whole to be a  mistake       and he went to the door      hear me but a moment  sir   cried she hastily  following him   since  you know of that transaction  do not refuse to listen to its occasion  i  took up the money for mr harrel  it was all  and solely for him       for mr harrel  was it   said he  with an air of supercilious  incredulity   that was rather an unlucky step  your servant  ma am      and he opened the door      you will not hear me  then  you will not credit me   cried she in the  cruellest agitation      some other time  ma am  at present my avocations are too numerous to  permit me      and again  stiffly bowing  he called to his servants  who were waiting  in the hall  and put himself into his chair         chapter v     a suspicion     cecilia was now left in a state of perturbation that was hardly to be  endured  the contempt with which she had been treated during the whole  visit was nothing short of insult  but the accusations with which it was  concluded did not more irritate than astonish her     that some strange prejudice had been taken against her  even more than  belonged to her connection with young delvile  the message brought her  by dr lyster had given her reason to suppose  what that prejudice was  she now knew  though how excited she was still ignorant  but she found  mr delvile had been informed she had taken up money of a jew  without  having heard it was for mr harrel  and that he had been acquainted with  her visits in portland street  without seeming to know mr belfield had  a sister  two charges such as these  so serious in their nature  and so  destructive of her character  filled her with horror and consternation   and even somewhat served to palliate his illiberal and injurious  behaviour     but how reports thus false and thus disgraceful should be raised  and by  what dark work of slander and malignity they had been spread  remained a  doubt inexplicable  they could not  she was certain  be the mere rumour  of chance  since in both the assertions there was some foundation of  truth  however cruelly perverted  or basely over charged     this led her to consider how few people there were not only who had  interest  but who had power to propagate such calumnies  even her  acquaintance with the belfields she remembered not ever mentioning   for she knew none of their friends  and none of her own knew them  how   then  should it be circulated  that she  visited often at the house    however be invented that it was from her  attention to the young man    henrietta  she was sure  was too good and too innocent to be guilty of  such perfidy  and the young man himself had always shewn a modesty and  propriety that manifested his total freedom from the vanity of such a  suspicion  and an elevation of sentiment that would have taught him to  scorn the boast  even if he believed the partiality     the mother  however  had neither been so modest nor so rational  she had  openly avowed her opinion that cecilia was in love with her son  and as  that son  by never offering himself  had never been refused  her opinion  had received no check of sufficient force  for a mind so gross and  literal  to change it     this part  therefore  of the charge she gave to mrs belfield  whose  officious and loquacious forwardness she concluded had induced her to  narrate her suspicions  till  step by step  they had reached mr delvile     but though able  by the probability of this conjecture  to account for  the report concerning belfield  the whole affair of the debt remained a  difficulty not to be solved  mr harrel  his wife  mr arnott  the jew and  mr monckton  were the only persons to whom the transaction was known   and though from five  a secret  in the course of so many months  might  easily be supposed likely to transpire  those five were so particularly  bound to silence  not only for her interest but their own  that it was  not unreasonable to believe it as safe among them all  as if solely  consigned to one  for herself  she had revealed it to no creature but mr  monckton  not even to delvile  though  upon her consenting to marry him   he had an undoubted right to be acquainted with the true state of  her affairs  but such had been the hurry  distress  confusion and  irresolution of her mind at that period  that this whole circumstance  had been driven from it entirely  and she had  since  frequently  blamed herself for such want of recollection  mr harrel  for a thousand  reasons  she was certain had never named it  and had the communication  come from his widow or from mr arnott  the motives would have been  related as well as the debt  and she had been spared the reproach of  contracting it for purposes of her own extravagance  the jew  indeed   was  to her  under no obligation of secrecy  but he had an obligation  far more binding   he was tied to himself     a suspicion now arose in her mind which made it thrill with horror    good god  she exclaimed  can mr monckton        she stopt  even to herself   she checked the idea   she drove it hastily  from her   she was certain it was false and cruel   she hated herself  for having started it      no   cried she   he is my friend  the confirmed friend of many years   my well wisher from childhood  my zealous counsellor and assistant  almost from my birth to this hour   such perfidy from him would not even  be human      yet still her perplexity was undiminished  the affair was undoubtedly  known  and it only could be known by the treachery of some one entrusted  with it  and however earnestly her generosity combated her rising  suspicions  she could not wholly quell them  and mr monckton s strange  aversion to the delviles  his earnestness to break off her connexion  with them  occurred to her remembrance  and haunted her perforce with  surmises to his disadvantage     that gentleman  when he came home  found her in this comfortless and  fluctuating state  endeavouring to form conjectures upon what had  happened  yet unable to succeed  but by suggestions which one moment  excited her abhorrence of him  and the next of herself     he enquired  with his usual appearance of easy friendliness  into what  had passed with her two guardians  and how she had settled her affairs   she answered without hesitation all his questions  but her manner was  cold and reserved  though her communication was frank     this was not unheeded by mr monckton  who  after a short time  begged to  know if any thing had disturbed her     cecilia  ashamed of her doubts  though unable to get rid of them  then  endeavoured to brighten up  and changed the subject to the difficulties  she had had to encounter from the obstinacy of mr briggs     mr monckton for a while humoured this evasion  but when  by her  own exertion  her solemnity began to wear off  he repeated his  interrogatory  and would not be satisfied without an answer     cecilia  earnest that surmises so injurious should be removed  then  honestly  but without comments  related the scene which had just past  between mr delvile and herself     no comments were  however  wanting to explain to mr monckton the change  of her behaviour   i see   he cried hastily   what you cannot but  suspect  and i will go myself to mr delvile  and insist upon his  clearing me      cecilia  shocked to have thus betrayed what was passing within her   assured him his vindication required not such a step  and begged he  would counsel her how to discover this treachery  without drawing from  her concern at it a conclusion so offensive to himself     he was evidently  however  and greatly disturbed  he declared his own  wonder equal to hers how the affair had been betrayed  expressed the  warmest indignation at the malevolent insinuations against her conduct   and lamented with mingled acrimony and grief  that there should exist  even the possibility of casting the odium of such villainy upon himself     cecilia  distressed  perplexed  and ashamed at once  again endeavoured  to appease him  and though a lurking doubt obstinately clung to her  understanding  the purity of her own principles  and the softness of her  heart  pleaded strongly for his innocence  and urged her to detest her  suspicion  though to conquer it they were unequal      it is true   said he  with an air ingenuous though mortified   i  dislike the delviles  and have always disliked them  they appear to me  a jealous  vindictive  and insolent race  and i should have thought i  betrayed the faithful regard i professed for you  had i concealed my  opinion when i saw you in danger of forming an alliance with them  i  spoke to you  therefore  with honest zeal  thoughtless of any enmity i  might draw upon myself  but though it was an interference from which i  hoped  by preventing the connection  to contribute to your happiness   it was not with a design to stop it at the expence of your character   a  design black  horrible  and diabolic  a design which must be formed by a  daemon  but which even a daemon could never  i think  execute      the candour of this speech  in which his aversion to the delviles was  openly acknowledged  and rationally justified  somewhat quieted the  suspicions of cecilia  which far more anxiously sought to be confuted  than confirmed  she began  therefore  to conclude that some accident   inexplicable as unfortunate  had occasioned the partial discovery to mr  delvile  by which her own goodness proved the source of her defamation   and though something still hung upon her mind that destroyed that firm  confidence she had hitherto felt in the friendship of mr monckton  she  held it utterly unjust to condemn him without proof  which she was not  more unable to procure  than to satisfy herself with any reason why so  perfidiously he should calumniate her     comfortless  however  and tormented with conjectures equally vague and  afflicting  she could only clear him to be lost in perplexity  she could  only accuse him to be penetrated with horror  she endeavoured to suspend  her judgment till time should develop the mystery  and only for the  present sought to finish her business and leave london     she renewed  therefore  again  the subject of mr briggs  and told him  how vain had been her effort to settle with him  mr monckton instantly  offered his services in assisting her  and the next morning they went  together to his house  where  after an obstinate battle  they gained  a complete victory  mr briggs gave up all his accounts  and  in a few  days  by the active interference of mr monckton  her affairs were wholly  taken out of his hands  he stormed  and prophesied all ill to cecilia   but it was not to any purpose  he was so disagreeable to her  by his  manners  and so unintelligible to her in matters of business  that  she was happy to have done with him  even though  upon inspecting his  accounts  they were all found clear and exact  and his desire to retain  his power over her fortune  proved to have no other motive than a love  of money so potent  that to manage it  even for another  gave him a  satisfaction he knew not how to relinquish     mr monckton  who  though a man of pleasure  understood business  perfectly well  now instructed and directed her in making a general  arrangement of her affairs  the estate which devolved to her from her  uncle  and which was all in landed property  she continued to commit to  the management of the steward who was employed in his life time  and  her own fortune from her father  which was all in the stocks  she now  diminished to nothing by selling out to pay mr monckton the principal  and interest which she owed him  and by settling with her bookseller     while these matters were transacting  which  notwithstanding her  eagerness to leave town  could not be brought into such a train as to  permit her absence in less than a week  she passed her time chiefly  alone  her wishes all inclined her to bestow it upon henrietta  but  the late attack of mr delvile had frightened her from keeping up  that connection  since however carefully she might confine it to the  daughter  mrs belfield  she was certain  would impute it all to the son     that attack rested upon her mind  in defiance of all her endeavours  to banish it  the contempt with which it was made seemed intentionally  offensive  as if he had been happy to derive from her supposed ill  conduct  a right to triumph over as well as reject her  she concluded   also  that delvile would be informed of these calumnies  yet she judged  his generosity by her own  and was therefore convinced he would not  credit them  but what chiefly at this time encreased her sadness and  uneasiness  was the mention of mrs delvile s broken constitution  and ruined health  she had always preserved for that lady the most  affectionate respect  and could not consider herself as the cause of her  sufferings  without feeling the utmost concern  however conscious she  had not wilfully occasioned them     nor was this scene the only one by which her efforts to forget this  family were defeated  her watchful monitor  albany  failed not again to  claim her promise  and though mr monckton earnestly exhorted her not to  trust herself out with him  she preferred a little risk to the keenness  of his reproaches  and the weather being good on the morning that he  called  she consented to accompany him in his rambles  only charging her  footman to follow where ever they went  and not to fail enquiring for  her if she stayed long out of his sight  these precautions were rather  taken to satisfy mr monckton than herself  who  having now procured  intelligence of the former disorder of his intellects  was fearful of  some extravagance  and apprehensive for her safety     he took her to a miserable house in a court leading into piccadilly   where  up three pair of stairs  was a wretched woman ill in bed  while a  large family of children were playing in the room      see here   cried he   what human nature can endure  look at that poor  wretch  distracted with torture  yet lying in all this noise  unable to  stir in her bed  yet without any assistant  suffering the pangs of acute  disease  yet wanting the necessaries of life      cecilia went up to the bed side  and enquired more particularly into the  situation of the invalid  but finding she could hardly speak from pain   she sent for the woman of the house  who kept a green grocer s shop on  the ground floor  and desired her to hire a nurse for her sick lodger   to call all the children down stairs  and to send for an apothecary   whose bill she promised to pay  she then gave her some money to get what  necessaries might be wanted  and said she would come again in two days  to see how they went on     albany  who listened to these directions with silent  yet eager  attention  now clasped both his hands with a look of rapture  and  exclaimed  virtue yet lives   and i have found her      cecilia  proud of such praise  and ambitious to deserve it  chearfully  said   where  sir  shall we go now       home   answered he with an aspect the most benign   i will not wear out  thy pity by rendering woe familiar to it      cecilia  though at this moment more disposed for acts of charity than  for business or for pleasure  remembered that her fortune however large  was not unlimited  and would not press any further bounty for objects  she knew not  certain that occasions and claimants  far beyond her  ability of answering  would but too frequently arise among those with  whom she was more connected  she therefore yielded herself to his  direction  and returned to soho square     again  however  he failed not to call the time she had appointed for  re visiting the invalid  to whom  with much gladness  he conducted her     the poor woman  whose disease was a rheumatic fever  was already much  better  she had been attended by an apothecary who had given her some  alleviating medicine  she had a nurse at her bedside  and the room being  cleared of the children  she had had the refreshment of some sleep     she was now able to raise her head  and make her acknowledgments to her  benefactress  but not a little was the surprise of cecilia  when  upon  looking in her face  she said   ah  madam  i have seen you before      cecilia  who had not the smallest recollection of her  in return desired  to know when  or where      when you were going to be married  madam  i was the pew opener at       church      cecilia started with secret horror  and involuntarily retreated from the  bed  while albany with a look of astonishment exclaimed   married   why   then  is it unknown       ask me not   cried she  hastily   it is all a mistake       poor thing   cried he   this  then  is the string thy nerves endure not  to have touched  sooner will i expire than a breath of mine shall make  it vibrate  oh sacred be thy sorrow  for thou canst melt at that of the  indigent      cecilia then made a few general enquiries  and heard that the poor  woman  who was a widow  had been obliged to give up her office  from  the frequent attacks which she suffered of the rheumatism  that she had  received much assistance both from the rector and the curate of       church  but her continual illness  with the largeness of her family   kept her distressed in spite of all help     cecilia promised to consider what she could do for her  and then giving  her more money  returned to lady margaret s     albany  who found that the unfortunate recollection of the pew opener  had awakened in his young pupil a melancholy train of reflections   seemed now to compassionate the sadness which hitherto he had reproved   and walking silently by her side till she came to soho square  said  in accents of kindness   peace light upon thy head  and dissipate thy  woes   and left her      ah when   cried she to herself   if thus they are to be revived  for ever      mr monckton  who observed that something had greatly affected her  now  expostulated warmly against albany and his wild schemes   you trifle  with your own happiness   he cried   by witnessing these scenes of  distress  and you will trifle away your fortune upon projects you can  never fulfil  the very air in those miserable houses is unwholesome for  you to breathe  you will soon be affected with some of the diseases to  which you so uncautiously expose yourself  and while not half you give  in charity will answer the purpose you wish  you will be plundered by  cheats and sharpers till you have nothing left to bestow  you must be  more considerate for yourself  and not thus governed by albany  whose  insanity is but partially cured  and whose projects are so boundless   that the whole capital of the east india company would not suffice to  fulfil them      cecilia  though she liked not the severity of this remonstrance   acknowledged there was some truth in it  and promised to be discreet   and take the reins into her own hands     there remained for her  however  no other satisfaction  and the path  which had thus been pointed out to her  grew more and more alluring  every step  her old friends  the poor hills  now occurred to her memory   and she determined to see herself in what manner they went on     the scene which this enquiry presented to her  was by no means  calculated to strengthen mr monckton s doctrine  for the prosperity in  which she found this little family  amply rewarded the liberality she  had shewn to it  and proved an irresistible encouragement to similar  actions  mrs hill wept for joy in recounting how well she succeeded   and cecilia  delighted by the power of giving such pleasure  forgot all  cautions and promises in the generosity which she displayed  she paid  mrs roberts the arrears that were due to her  she discharged all that  was owing for the children who had been put to school  desired they  might still be sent to it solely at her expense  and gave the mother a  sum of money to be laid out in presents for them all     to perform her promise with the pew opener was however more difficult   her ill health  and the extreme youth of her children making her utterly  helpless  but these were not considerations for cecilia to desert her   but rather motives for regarding her as more peculiarly an object  of charity  she found she had once been a clear starcher  and was a  tolerable plain work woman  she resolved  therefore  to send her into  the country  where she hoped to be able to get her some business  and  knew that at least  she could help her  if unsuccessful  and see that  her children were brought up to useful employments  the woman herself  was enchanted at the plan  and firmly persuaded the country air would  restore her health  cecilia told her only to wait till she was well  enough to travel  and promised  in the mean time  to look out some  little habitation for her  she then gave her money to pay her bills  and  for her journey  and writing a full direction where she would hear of  her at bury  took leave of her till that time     these magnificent donations and designs  being communicated to albany   seemed a renovation to him of youth  spirit  and joy  while their effect  upon mr monckton resembled an annihilation of all three  to see money  thus sported away  which he had long considered as his own  to behold  those sums which he had destined for his pleasures  thus lavishly  bestowed upon beggars  excited a rage he could with difficulty conceal   and an uneasiness he could hardly endure  and he languished  he sickened  for the time  when he might put a period to such romantic proceedings     such were the only occupations which interrupted the solitude of  cecilia  except those which were given to her by actual business  and  the moment her affairs were in so much forwardness that they could be  managed by letters  she prepared for returning into the country  she  acquainted lady margaret and mr monckton with her design  and gave  orders to her servants to be ready to set off the next day     mr monckton made not any opposition  and refused himself the  satisfaction of accompanying her  and lady margaret  whose purpose was  now answered  and who wished to be in the country herself  determined to  follow her         chapter vi     a disturbance     this matter being settled at breakfast  cecilia  having but one day more  to spend in london  knew not how to let it pass without taking leave of  henrietta  though she chose not again to expose herself to the forward  insinuations of her mother  she sent her  therefore  a short note   begging to see her at lady margaret s  and acquainting her that the next  day she was going out of town     henrietta returned the following answer      to miss beverley      madam   my mother is gone to market  and i must not go out without her  leave  i have run to the door at every knock this whole week in hopes  you were coming  and my heart has jumpt at every coach that has gone  through the street  dearest lady  why did you tell me you would come  i  should not have thought of such a great honour if you had not put it in  my head  and now i have got the use of a room where i can often be alone  for two or three hours together  and so i shall this morning  if it  was possible my dear miss beverley could come  but i don t mean to be  teasing  and i would not be impertinent or encroaching for the world   but only the thing is i have a great deal to say to you  and if you was  not so rich a lady  and so much above me  i am sure i should love you  better than any body in the whole world  almost  and now i dare say i  shan t see you at all  for it rains very hard  and my mother  i know   will be sadly angry if i ask to go in a coach  o dear  i don t know  what i can do  for it will half break my heart  if my dear miss beverley  should go out of town  and i not see her   i am  madam  with the  greatest respectfulness  your most humble servant     henrietta belfield     this artless remonstrance  joined to the intelligence that she could  see her alone  made cecilia instantly order a chair  and go herself to  portland street  for she found by this letter there was much doubt if  she could otherwise see her  and the earnestness of henrietta made her  now not endure to disappoint her   she has much   cried she   to say to  me  and i will no longer refuse to hear her  she shall unbosom to me  her gentle heart  for we have now nothing to fear from each other  she  promises herself pleasure from the communication  and doubtless it must  be some relief to her  oh were there any friendly bosom  in which i  might myself confide   happier henrietta  less fearful of thy pride   less tenacious of thy dignity  thy sorrows at least seek the consolation  of sympathy   mine  alas  fettered by prudence  must fly it      she was shewn into the parlour  which she had the pleasure to find  empty  and  in an instant  the warm hearted henrietta was in her arms    this is sweet of you indeed   cried she   for i did not know how to ask  it  though it rains so hard i could not have walked to you  and i don t  know what i should have done  if you had gone away and quite forgot me      she then took her into the back parlour  which she said they had lately  hired  and  as it was made but little use of  she had it almost entirely  to herself     there had passed a sad scene  she told her  at the meeting with her  brother  though now they were a little more comfortable  yet  her  mother  she was sure  would never be at rest till he got into some  higher way of life   and  indeed  i have some hopes   she continued    that we shall be able by and bye to do something better for him  for  he has got one friend in the world  yet  thank god  and such a noble  friend   indeed i believe he can do whatever he pleases for him   that  is i mean i believe if he was to ask any thing for him  there s nobody  would deny him  and this is what i wanted to talk to you about        cecilia  who doubted not but she meant delvile  scarce knew how to press  the subject  though she came with no other view  henrietta  however  too  eager to want solicitation  went on      but the question is whether we shall be able to prevail upon my brother  to accept any thing  for he grows more and more unwilling to be obliged   and the reason is  that being poor  he is afraid  i believe  people  should think he wants to beg of them  though if they knew him as well  as i do  they would not long think that  for i am sure he would a great  deal rather be starved to death  but indeed  to say the truth  i am  afraid he has been sadly to blame in this affair  and quarrelled when  there was no need to be affronted  for i have seen a gentleman who knows  a great deal better than my brother what people should do  and he says  he took every thing wrong that was done  all the time he was at lord  vannelt s       and how does this gentleman know it       o because he went himself to enquire about it  for he knows lord  vannelt very well  and it was by his means my brother came acquainted  with him  and this gentleman would not have wished my brother to be used  ill any more than i should myself  so i am sure i may believe what he  says  but my poor brother  not being a lord himself  thought every body  meant to be rude to him  and because he knew he was poor  he suspected  they all behaved disrespectfully to him  but this gentleman gave me his  word that every body liked him and esteemed him  and if he would not  have been so suspicious  they would all have done any thing for him in  the world       you know this gentleman very well  then       o no  madam   she answered hastily   i don t know him at all  he only  comes here to see my brother  it would be very impertinent for me to  call him an acquaintance of mine       was it before your brother  then  he held this conversation with you       o no  my brother would have been affronted with him  too  if he had   but he called here to enquire for him at the time when he was lost to  us  and my mother quite went down upon her knees to him to beg him to  go to lord vannelt s  and make excuses for him  if he had not behaved  properly  but if my brother was to know this  he would hardly speak to  her again  so when this gentleman came next  i begged him not to mention  it  for my mother happened to be out  and so i saw him alone       and did he stay with you long       no  ma am  a very short time indeed  but i asked him questions all the  while  and kept him as long as i could  that i might hear all he had to  say about my brother       have you never seen him since       no  ma am  not once  i suppose he does not know my brother is come back  to us  perhaps when he does  he will call       do you wish him to call       me   cried she  blushing   a little   sometimes i do   for my brother s  sake       for your brother s sake  ah my dear henrietta  but tell me   or  don t   tell me if you had rather not   did i not once see you kissing a letter   perhaps it was from this same noble friend       it was not a letter  madam   said she  looking down   it was only the  cover of one to my brother       the cover of a letter only   and that to your brother   is it possible  you could so much value it       ah madam   you   who are always used to the good and the wise  who see  no other sort of people but those in high life   you  can have no notion  how they strike those that they are new to   but i who see them seldom   and who live with people so very unlike them  oh you cannot guess how  sweet to  me  is every thing that belongs to them  whatever has but  once been touched by their hands  i should like to lock up  and keep for  ever  though if i was used to them  as you are  perhaps i might think  less of them      alas  thought cecilia  who by  them  knew she only meant  him   little  indeed would further intimacy protect you      we are all over ready   continued henrietta   to blame others  and that  is the way i have been doing all this time myself  but i don t blame my  poor brother now for living so with the great as i used to do  for now  i have seen a little more of the world  i don t wonder any longer at his  behaviour  for i know how it is  and i see that those who have had good  educations  and kept great company  and mixed with the world   o it  is another thing   they seem quite a different species   they are so  gentle  so soft mannered  nothing comes from them but what is meant  to oblige  they seem as if they only lived to give pleasure to other  people  and as if they never thought at all of themselves       ah henrietta   said cecilia  shaking her head   you have caught the  enthusiasm of your brother  though you so long condemned it  oh have a  care lest  like him also  you find it as pernicious as it is alluring       there  is no danger for  me   madam   answered she   for the people i  so much admire are quite out of my reach  i hardly ever even see them   and perhaps it may so happen i may see them no more       the people   said cecilia  smiling   are there  then  many you so much  distinguish       oh no indeed   cried she  eagerly   there is only one  there  can   be  i mean there are only a few    she checked herself  and stopt      whoever you admire   cried cecilia   your admiration cannot but honour   yet indulge it not too far  lest it should wander from your heart to  your peace  and make you wretched for life       ah madam   i see you know who is the particular person i was thinking  of  but indeed you are quite mistaken if you suppose any thing bad of  me       bad of you   cried cecilia  embracing her   i scarce think so well of  any one       but i mean  madam  if you think i forget he is so much above me  but  indeed i never do  for i only admire him for his goodness to my brother   and never think of him at all  but just by way of comparing him   sometimes  to the other people that i see  because he makes me hate them  so  that i wish i was never to see them again       his acquaintance  then   said cecilia   has done you but an ill office   and happy it would be for you could you forget you had ever made it       o  i shall never do that  for the more i think of him  the more i  am out of humour with every body else  o miss beverley  we have a sad  acquaintance indeed  i m sure i don t wonder my brother was so ashamed  of them  they are all so rude  and so free  and put one so out of  countenance   o how different is this person you are thinking of  he  would not distress anybody  or make one ashamed for all the world   you   only are like him  always gentle  always obliging   sometimes i think  you must be his sister  once  too  i heard  but that was contradicted      a deep sigh escaped cecilia at this speech  she guessed too well  what she might have heard  and she knew too well how it might be  contradicted      surely   you  cannot be unhappy  miss beverley   said henrietta  with a  look of mingled surprise and concern      i have much  i own   cried cecilia  assuming more chearfulness   to be  thankful for  and i endeavour not to forget it       o how often do i think   cried henrietta   that you  madam  are  the happiest person in the world  with every thing at your own  disposal   with every body in love with you  with all the money that you  can wish for  and so much sweetness that nobody can envy you it  with  power to keep just what company you please  and every body proud to be  one of the number   oh if i could chuse who i would be  i should sooner  say miss beverley than any princess in the world      ah  thought cecilia  if such is my situation   how cruel that by one  dreadful blow all its happiness should be thrown away      were i a rich lady  like you   continued henrietta   and quite in my  own power  then  indeed  i might soon think of nothing but those people  that i admire  and that makes me often wonder that  you   madam  who are  just such another as himself  but then  indeed  you may see so many of  the same sort  that just this one may not so much strike you  and for  that reason i hope with all my heart that he will never be married as  long as he lives  for as he must take some lady in just such high life  as his own  i should always be afraid that she would never love him as  she ought to do      he need not now be single  thought cecilia  were that all he had cause  to apprehend      i often think   added henrietta   that the rich would be as much  happier for marrying the poor  as the poor for marrying the rich  for  then they would take somebody that would try to deserve their kindness   and now they only take those that know they have a right to it  often  and often have i thought so about this very gentleman  and sometimes  when i have been in his company  and seen his civility and his  sweetness  i have fancied i was rich and grand myself  and it has quite  gone out of my head that i was nothing but poor henrietta belfield       did he  then   cried cecilia a little alarmed   ever seek to ingratiate  himself into your favour       no  never  but when treated with so much softness   tis hard always  to remember one s meanness  you  madam  have no notion of that task  no  more had i myself till lately  for i cared not who was high  nor who was  low  but now  indeed  i must own i have some times wished myself richer   yet he assumes so little  that at other times  i have almost forgot all  distance between us  and even thought  oh foolish thought        tell it  sweet henrietta  however       i will tell you  madam  every thing  for my heart has been bursting to  open itself  and nobody have i dared trust  i have thought  then  i have  sometimes thought   my true affection  my faithful fondness  my glad  obedience   might make him  if he did but know them  happier in me than  in a greater lady       indeed   cried cecilia  extremely affected by this plaintive  tenderness   i believe it  and were i him  i could not  i think   hesitate a moment in my choice      henrietta now  hearing her mother coming in  made a sign to her to be  silent  but mrs belfield had not been an instant in the passage  before  a thundering knocking at the street door occasioned it to be instantly  re opened  a servant then enquired if mrs belfield was at home  and  being answered by herself in the affirmative  a chair was brought into  the house     but what was the astonishment of cecilia  when  in another moment  she  heard from the next parlour the voice of mr delvile senior  saying    your servant  ma am  mrs belfield  i presume      there was no occasion  now  to make a sign to her of silence  for her  own amazement was sufficient to deprive her of speech      yes  sir   answered mrs belfield   but i suppose  sir  you are some  gentleman to my son       no  madam   he returned   my business is with yourself      cecilia now recovering from her surprise  determined to hasten unnoticed  out of the house  well knowing that to be seen in it would be regarded  as a confirmation of all that he had asserted  she whispered  therefore   to henrietta  that she must instantly run away  but  upon softly opening  the door leading to the passage  she found mr delvile s chairmen  and a  footman there in waiting     she closed it again  irresolute what to do  but after a little  deliberation  she concluded to out stay him  as she was known to all  his servants  who would not fail to mention seeing her  and a retreat so  private was worse than any other risk  a chair was also in waiting for  herself  but it was a hackney one  and she could not be known by it   and her footman she had fortunately dismissed  as he had business to  transact for her journey next day     mean while the thinness of the partition between the two parlours made  her hearing every word that was said unavoidable      i am sure  sir  i shall be very willing to oblige you   mrs belfield  answered   but pray  sir  what s your name       my name  ma am   he replied  in a rather elevated voice   i am seldom  obliged to announce myself  nor is there any present necessity i should  make it known  it is sufficient i assure you  you are speaking to no  very common person  and probably to one you will have little chance to  meet with again       but how can i tell your business  sir  if i don t so much as know your  name       my business  madam  i mean to tell myself  your affair is only to hear  it  i have some questions  indeed  to ask  which i must trouble you to  answer  but they will sufficiently explain themselves to prevent  any difficulty upon your part  there is no need  therefore  of any  introductory ceremonial       well  sir   said mrs belfield  wholly insensible of this ambiguous  greatness   if you mean to make your name a secret       few names  i believe  ma am   cried he  haughtily   have less the  advantage of secrecy than mine  on the contrary  this is but one among  a very few houses in this town to which my person would not immediately  announce it  that  however  is immaterial  and you will be so good as to  rest satisfied with my assurances  that the person with whom you are now  conversing  will prove no disgrace to your character      mrs belfield  overpowered  though hardly knowing  with what  only said   he was very welcome   and begged him to sit down      excuse me  ma am   he answered   my business is but of a moment  and my  avocations are too many to suffer my infringing that time  you say you  have a son  i have heard of him  also  somewhere before  pray will you  give me leave to enquire  i don t mean to go deep into the matter   but  particular family occurrences make it essential for me to know   whether  there is not a young person of rather a capital fortune  to whom he is  supposed to make proposals       lack a day  no  sir   answered mrs belfield  to the infinite relief of  cecilia  who instantly concluded this question referred to herself      i beg your pardon  then  good morning to you  ma am   said mr delvile   in a tone that spoke his disappointment  but added  and there is no such  young person  you say  who favours his pretensions       dear sir   cried she   why there s nobody he ll so much as put the  question to  there s a young lady at this very time  a great fortune   that has as much a mind to him  i tell him  as any man need desire to  see  but there s no making him think it  though he has been brought up  at the university  and knows more about all the things  or as much  as  any body in the king s dominions       o  then   cried mr delvile  in a voice of far more complacency   it is  not on the side of the young woman that the difficulty seems to rest       lord  no  sir  he might have had her again and again only for asking   she came after him ever so often  but being brought up  as i said  at  the university  he thought he knew better than me  and so my preaching  was all as good as lost upon him      the consternation of cecilia at these speeches could by nothing be  equalled but by the shame of henrietta  who  though she knew not to  whom her mother made them  felt all the disgrace and the shock of them  herself      i suppose  sir   continued mrs belfield   you know my son       no  ma am  my acquaintance is  not very universal       then  sir  you are no judge how well he might make his own terms  and  as to this young lady  she found him out  sir  when not one of his own  natural friends could tell where in the world he was gone  she was the  first  sir  to come and tell me news of him though i was his own mother   love  sir  is prodigious for quickness  it can see  i sometimes  think  through bricks and mortar  yet all this would not do  he was so  obstinate not to take the hint      cecilia now felt so extremely provoked  she was upon the point of  bursting in upon them to make her own vindication  but as her passions   though they tried her reason never conquered it  she restrained herself  by considering that to issue forth from a room in that house  would do  more towards strengthening what was thus boldly asserted  than all her  protestations could have chance to destroy      and as to young ladies themselves   continued mrs belfield   they know  no more how to make their minds known than a baby does  so i suppose  he ll shilly shally till somebody else will cry snap  and take her  it  is but a little while ago that it was all the report she was to have  young mr delvile  one of her guardian s sons       i am sorry report was so impertinent   cried mr delvile  with much  displeasure   young mr delvile is not to be disposed of with so little  ceremony  he knows better what is due to his family      cecilia here blushed from indignation  and henrietta sighed from  despondency      lord  sir   answered mrs belfield   what should his family do better   i never heard they were any so rich  and i dare say the old gentleman   being her guardian  took care to put his son enough in her way  however  it came about that they did not make a match of it  for as to old mr  delvile  all the world says         all the world takes a very great liberty   angrily interrupted  mr delvile   in saying any thing about him  and you will excuse my  informing you that a person of his rank and consideration  is not  lightly to be mentioned upon every little occasion that occurs       lord  sir   cried mrs belfield  somewhat surprised at this unexpected  prohibition   i don t care for my part if i never mention the old  gentleman s name again  i never heard any good of him in my life  for  they say he s as proud as lucifer  and nobody knows what it s of  for  they say         they  say   cried he  firing with rage   and who are  they   be so  good as inform me that       lord  every body  sir  it s his common character       then every body is extremely indecent   speaking very loud   to pay  no more respect to one of the first families in england  it is a  licentiousness that ought by no means to be suffered with impunity      here  the street door being kept open by the servants in waiting  a  new step was heard in the passage  which henrietta immediately knowing   turned  with uplifted hands to cecilia  and whispered   how unlucky   it s my brother  i thought he would not have returned till night       surely he will not come in here   re whispered cecilia     but  at the same moment  he opened the door  and entered the room  he  was immediately beginning an apology  and starting back  but henrietta  catching him by the arm  told him in a low voice  that she had made use  of his room because she had thought him engaged for the day  but begged  him to keep still and quiet  as the least noise would discover them     belfield then stopt  but the embarrassment of cecilia was extreme   to find herself in his room after the speeches she had heard from his  mother  and to continue with him in it by connivance  when she knew she  had been represented as quite at his service  distressed and provoked  her immeasurably  and she felt very angry with henrietta for not sooner  informing her whose apartment she had borrowed  yet now to remove  and  to be seen  was not to be thought of  she kept  therefore  fixed to  her seat  though changing colour every moment from the variety of her  emotions     during this painful interruption she lost mrs belfield s next answer   and another speech or two from mr delvile  to whose own passion and  loudness was owing belfield s entering his room unheard  but the next  voice that called their attention was that of mr hobson  who just then  walked into the parlour      why what s to do here   cried he  facetiously   nothing but chairs and  livery servants  why  ma am  what is this your rout day  sir your most  humble servant  i ask pardon  but i did not know you at first  but come   suppose we were all to sit down  sitting s as cheap as standing  and  what i say is this  when a man s tired  it s more agreeable       have you any thing further  ma am   said mr delvile  with great  solemnity   to communicate to me       no  sir   said mrs belfield  rather angrily   it s no business of mine  to be communicating myself to a gentleman that i don t know the name of   why  mr hobson  how come you to know the gentleman       to know  me    repeated mr delvile  scornfully      why i can t say much  ma am   answered mr hobson   as to my knowing the  gentleman  being i have been in his company but once  and what i say is   to know a person if one leaves but a quart in a hogshead  it s two pints  too much  that s my notion  but  sir  that was but an ungain business  at  squire monckton s t other morning  every body was no how  as one may  say  but  sir  if i may be so free  pray what is your private opinion of  that old gentleman that talked so much out of the way       my private opinion  sir       yes  sir  i mean if it s no secret  for as to a secret  i hold it s  what no man has a right to enquire into  being of its own nature it s  a thing not to be told  now as to what i think myself  my doctrine is  this  i am quite of the old gentleman s mind about some things  and  about others i hold him to be quite wide of the mark  but as to talking  in such a whisky frisky manner that nobody can understand him  why  its tantamount to not talking at all  being he might as well hold his  tongue  that s what  i  say  and then as to that other article  of  abusing a person for not giving away all his lawful gains to every  cripple in the streets  just because he happens to have but one leg  or  one eye  or some such matter  why it s knowing nothing of business  it s  what  i  call talking at random       when you have finished  sir   said mr delvile   you will be so good to  let me know       i don t mean to intrude  sir  that s not my way  so if you are upon  business        what else  sir  could you suppose brought me hither  however  i by no  means purpose any discussion  i have only a few words more to say to  this gentlewoman  and as my time is not wholly inconsequential  i should  not be sorry to have an early opportunity of being heard       i shall leave you with the lady directly  sir  for i know business  better than to interrupt it  but seeing chairs in the entry  my notion  was i should see ladies in the parlour  not much thinking of gentlemen s  going about in that manner  being i never did it myself  but i have  nothing to offer against that  let every man have his own way  that s  what  i  say  only just let me ask the lady before i go  what s the  meaning of my seeing two chairs in the entry  and only a person for one  in the parlour  the gentleman  i suppose  did not come in  both   ha   ha  ha       why now you put me in mind   said mrs belfield   i saw a chair as  soon as i come in  and i was just going to say who s here  when this  gentleman s coming put it out of my head       why this is what i call hocus pocus work   said mr hobson   but i shall  make free to ask the chairmen who they are waiting for      mrs belfield  however  anticipated him  for running into the passage   she angrily called out   what do you do here  misters  do you only come  to be out of the rain  i ll have no stand made of my entry  i can tell  you       why we are waiting for the lady   cried one of them      waiting for a fiddlestick   said mrs belfield   here s no lady here   nor no company  so if you think i ll have my entry filled up by two  hulking fellows for nothing  i shall shew you the difference  one s dirt  enough of one s own  without taking people out of the streets to help  one  who do you think s to clean after you       that s no business of ours  the lady bid us wait   answered the man     cecilia at this dispute could with pleasure have cast herself out of the  window to avoid being discovered  but all plan of escape was too late   mrs belfield called aloud for her daughter  and then  returning to the  front parlour  said   i ll soon know if there s company come to my house  without my knowing it   and opened a door leading to the next room     cecilia  who had hitherto sat fixed to her chair  now hastily arose  but  in a confusion too cruel for speech  belfield  wondering even at his own  situation  and equally concerned and surprised at her evident distress   had himself the feeling of a culprit  though without the least knowledge  of any cause  and henrietta  terrified at the prospect of her mother s  anger  retreated as much as possible out of sight     such was the situation of the discovered  abashed  perplexed  and  embarrassed  while that of the discoverers  far different  was bold   delighted  and triumphant      so   cried mrs belfield   why here s miss beverley   in my son s back  room   winking at mr delvile      why here s a lady  sure enough   said mr hobson   and just where she  should be  and that is with a gentleman  ha  ha  that s the right way   according to my notion  that s the true maxim for living agreeable       i came to see miss belfield   cried cecilia  endeavouring  but vainly   to speak with composure   and she brought me into this room       i am but this moment   cried belfield  with eagerness   returned home   and unfortunately broke into the room  from total ignorance of the  honour which miss beverley did my sister      these speeches  though both literally true  sounded  in the  circumstances which brought them out  so much as mere excuses  that  while mr delvile haughtily marked his incredulity by a motion of his  chin  mrs belfield continued winking at him most significantly  and mr  hobson  with still less ceremony  laughed aloud      i have nothing more  ma am   said mr delvile to mrs belfield   to  enquire  for the few doubts with which i came to this house are now  entirely satisfied  good morning to you  ma am       give me leave  sir   said cecilia  advancing with more spirit   to  explain  in presence of those who can best testify my veracity  the real  circumstances        i would by no means occasion you such unnecessary trouble  ma am    answered he  with an air at once exulting and pompous   the situation in  which i see you abundantly satisfies my curiosity  and saves me from the  apprehension i was under of being again convicted of a  mistake       he then made her a stiff bow  and went to his chair     cecilia  colouring deeply at this contemptuous treatment  coldly took  leave of henrietta  and courtsying to mrs belfield  hastened into the  passage  to get into her own     henrietta was too much intimidated to speak  and belfield was too  delicate to follow her  mr hobson only said  the young lady seems quite  dashed   but mrs belfield pursued her with entreaties she would stay     she was too angry  however  to make any answer but by a distant bow of  the head  and left the house with a resolution little short of a vow  never again to enter it     her reflections upon this unfortunate visit were bitter beyond measure   the situation in which she had been surprised   clandestinely concealed  with only belfield and his sister  joined to the positive assertions of  her partiality for him made by his mother  could not  to mr delvile  but  appear marks irrefragable that his charge in his former conversation  was rather mild than over strained  and that the connection he had  mentioned  for whatever motives denied  was incontestably formed     the apparent conviction of this part of the accusation  might also  authorise  to one but too happy in believing ill of her  an implicit  faith in that which regarded her having run out her fortune  his  determination not to hear her shewed the inflexibility of his character   and it was evident  notwithstanding his parading pretensions of wishing  her welfare  that his inordinate pride was inflamed  at the very  supposition he could be mistaken or deceived for a moment     even delvile himself  if gone abroad  might now hear this account with  exaggerations that would baffle all his confidence  his mother   too  greatly as she esteemed and loved her  might have the matter so  represented as to stagger her good opinion   these were thoughts the  most afflicting she could harbour  though their probability was such  that to banish them was impossible     to apply again to mr delvile to hear her vindication  was to subject  herself to insolence  and almost to court indignity  she disdained  even to write to him  since his behaviour called for resentment  not  concession  and such an eagerness to be heard  in opposition to all  discouragement  would be practising a meanness that would almost merit  repulsion     her first inclination was to write to mrs delvile  but what now  to her   was either her defence or accusation  she had solemnly renounced all  further intercourse with her  she had declared against writing again   and prohibited her letters  and  therefore  after much fluctuation of  opinion  her delicacy concurred with her judgment  to conclude it would  be most proper  in a situation so intricate  to leave the matter to  chance  and commit her character to time     in the evening  while she was at tea with lady margaret and miss bennet   she was suddenly called out to speak to a young woman  and found  to her  great surprise  she was no other than henrietta      ah madam   she cried   how angrily did you go away this morning  it  has made me miserable ever since  and if you go out of town without  forgiving me  i shall fret myself quite ill  my mother is gone out to  tea  and i have run here all alone  and in the dark  and in the wet   to beg and pray you will forgive me  for else i don t know what i shall  do       sweet  gentle girl   cried cecilia  affectionately embracing her   if  you had excited all the anger i am capable of feeling  such softness as  this would banish it  and make me love you more than ever      henrietta then said  in her excuse  that she had thought herself quite  sure of her brother s absence  who almost always spent the whole day at  the bookseller s  as in writing himself he perpetually wanted to consult  other authors  and had very few books at their lodgings  but she would  not mention that the room was his  lest cecilia should object to  making use of it  and she knew she had no other chance of having the  conversation with her she had so very long wished for  she then again  begged her pardon  and hoped the behaviour of her mother would not  induce her to give her up  as she was shocked at it beyond measure  and  as her brother  she assured her  was as innocent of it as herself     cecilia heard her with pleasure  and felt for her an encreasing regard   the openness of her confidence in the morning had merited all her  affection  and she gave her the warmest protestations of a friendship  which she was certain would be lasting as her life     henrietta then  with a countenance that spoke the lightness of her  heart  hastily took her leave  saying she did not dare be out longer   lest her mother should discover her excursion  cecilia insisted   however  upon her going in a chair  which she ordered her servant to  attend  and take care himself to discharge     this visit  joined to the tender and unreserved conversation of the  morning  gave cecilia the strongest desire to invite her to her house in  the country  but the terror of mrs belfield s insinuations  added to  the cruel interpretations she had to expect from mr delvile  forbid her  indulging this wish  though it was the only one that just now she could  form         chapter vii     a calm     cecilia took leave over night of the family  as she would not stay their  rising in the morning  mr monckton  though certain not to sleep when she  was going  forbearing to mark his solicitude by quitting his apartment  at any unusual hour  lady margaret parted from her with her accustomed  ungraciousness  and miss bennet  because in her presence  in a manner  scarcely less displeasing     the next morning  with only her servants  the moment it was light  she  set out  her journey was without incident or interruption  and she went  immediately to the house of mrs bayley  where she had settled to board  till her own was finished     mrs bayley was a mere good sort of woman  who lived decently well with  her servants  and tolerably well with her neighbours  upon a small  annuity  which made her easy and comfortable  though by no means  superior to such an addition to her little income as an occasional  boarder might produce     here cecilia continued a full month  which time had no other  employment than what she voluntarily gave to herself by active deeds of  benevolence     at christmas  to the no little joy of the neighbourhood  she took  possession of her own house  which was situated about three miles from  bury     the better sort of people were happy to see her thus settled amongst  them  and the poorer  who by what they already had received  knew  well what they still might expect  regarded the day in which she  fixed herself in her mansion  as a day to themselves of prosperity and  triumph     as she was no longer  as hitherto  repairing to a temporary habitation   which at pleasure she might quit  and to which  at a certain period  she  could have no possible claim  but to a house which was her own for  ever  or  at least  could solely by her own choice be transferred   she determined  as much as was in her power  in quitting her desultory  dwellings  to empty her mind of the transactions which had passed in  them  and upon entering a house where she was permanently to reside   to make the expulsion of her past sorrows  the basis upon which to  establish her future serenity     and this  though a work of pain and difficulty  was not impracticable   her sensibility  indeed  was keen  and she had suffered from it the  utmost torture  but her feelings were not more powerful than her  understanding was strong  and her fortitude was equal to her trials   her calamities had saddened  but not weakened her mind  and the words  of delvile in speaking of his mother occurred to her now with all  the conviction of experience  that  evils inevitable are always best  supported  because known to be past amendment  and felt to give defiance  to struggling    footnote  see vol  ii  p           a plan by which so great a revolution was to be wrought in her mind  was  not to be effected by any sudden effort of magnanimity  but by a regular  and even tenour of courage mingled with prudence  nothing  therefore   appeared to her so indispensable as constant employment  by which a  variety of new images might force their way in her mind to supplant  the old ones  and by which no time might be allowed for brooding over  melancholy retrospections     her first effort  in this work of mental reformation  was to part with  fidel  whom hitherto she had almost involuntarily guarded  but whom she  only could see to revive the most dangerous recollections  she sent him   therefore  to the castle  but without any message  mrs delvile  she was  sure  would require none to make her rejoice in his restoration     her next step was writing to albany  who had given her his direction  to  acquaint him she was now ready to put in practice their long concerted  scheme  albany instantly hastened to her  and joyfully accepted the  office of becoming at once her almoner and her monitor  he made it his  business to seek objects of distress  and always but too certain to find  them  of conducting her himself to their habitations  and then leaving  to her own liberality the assistance their several cases demanded  and   in the overflowing of his zeal upon these occasions  and the rapture  of his heart in thus disposing  almost at his pleasure  of her noble  fortune  he seemed  at times  to feel an extasy that  from its novelty  and its excess  was almost too exquisite to be borne  he joined with the  beggars in pouring blessings upon her head  he prayed for her with the  poor  and he thanked her with the succoured     the pew opener and her children failed not to keep their appointment   and cecilia presently contrived to settle them in her neighbourhood   where the poor woman  as she recovered her strength  soon got a little  work  and all deficiencies in her power of maintaining herself were  supplied by her generous patroness  the children  however  she ordered  to be coarsely brought up  having no intention to provide for them but  by helping them to common employments     the promise  also  so long made to mrs harrel of an apartment in  her house  was now performed  that lady accepted it with the utmost  alacrity  glad to make any change in her situation  which constant  solitude had rendered wholly insupportable  mr arnott accompanied her to  the house  and spent one day there  but receiving from cecilia   though extremely civil and sweet to him  no hint of any invitation for  repeating his visit  he left it in sadness  and returned to his own in  deep dejection  cecilia saw with concern how he nourished his hopeless  passion  but knew that to suffer his visits would almost authorise  his feeding it  and while she pitied unaffectedly the unhappiness she  occasioned  she resolved to double her own efforts towards avoiding  similar wretchedness     this action  however  was a point of honour  not of friendship  the time  being long since past that the society of mrs harrel could afford her  any pleasure  but the promises she had so often made to mr harrel in  his distresses  though extorted from her merely by the terrors of the  moment  still were promises  and  therefore  she held herself bound to  fulfil them     yet far from finding comfort in this addition to her family  mrs harrel  proved to her nothing more than a trouble and an incumbrance  with  no inherent resources  she was continually in search of occasional  supplies  she fatigued cecilia with wonder at the privacy of her life   and tormented her with proposals of parties and entertainments  she  was eternally in amazement that with powers so large  she had wishes so  confined  and was evidently disappointed that upon coming to so ample an  estate  she lived  with respect to herself and her family  with no more  magnificence or shew than if heiress to only u    a year     but cecilia was determined to think and to live for herself  without  regard to unmeaning wonder or selfish remonstrances  she had neither  ambition for splendour  nor spirits for dissipation  the recent sorrow  of her heart had deadened it for the present to all personal taste of  happiness  and her only chance for regaining it  seemed through the  medium of bestowing it upon others  she had seen  too  by mr harrel   how wretchedly external brilliancy could cover inward woe  and she  had learned at delvile castle to grow sick of parade and grandeur  her  equipage  therefore  was without glare  though not without elegance  her  table was plain  though hospitably plentiful  her servants were for use   though too numerous to be for labour  the system of her oeconomy  like  that of her liberality  was formed by rules of reason  and her own ideas  of right  and not by compliance with example  nor by emulation with the  gentry in her neighbourhood     but though thus deviating in her actions from the usual customs of  the young and rich  she was peculiarly careful not to offend them  by singularity of manners  when she mixed with them  she was easy   unaffected  and well bred  and though she saw them but seldom  her good  humour and desire of obliging kept them always her friends  the plan  she had early formed at mrs harrel s she now studied daily to put in  practice  but that part by which the useless or frivolous were to be  excluded her house  she found could only be supported by driving from  her half her acquaintance     another part  also  of that project she found still less easy of  adoption  which was solacing herself with the society of the wise  good   and intelligent  few answered this description  and those few were with  difficulty attainable  many might with joy have sought out her liberal  dwelling  but no one had idly waited till the moment it was at her  disposal  all who possessed at once both talents and wealth  were  so generally courted they were rarely to be procured  and all who to  talents alone owed their consequence  demanded  if worth acquiring  time  and delicacy to be obtained  fortune she knew  however  was so often at  war with nature  that she doubted not shortly meeting those who would  gladly avail themselves of her offered protection     yet  tired of the murmurs of mrs harrel  she longed for some relief from  her society  and her desire daily grew stronger to owe that relief to  henrietta belfield  the more she meditated upon this wish  the less  unattainable it appeared to her  till by frequently combating its  difficulties  she began to consider them imaginary  mrs belfield  while  her son was actually with herself  might see she took not henrietta as  his appendage  and mr delvile  should he make further enquiries  might  hear that her real connection was with the sister  since she received  her in the country  where the brother made no pretence to follow  her  she considered  too  how ill she should be rewarded in giving up  henrietta for mr delvile  who was already determined to think ill of  her  and whose prejudices no sacrifice would remove     having hesitated  therefore  some time between the desire of present  alleviation  and the fear of future mischief  the consciousness of her  own innocence at length vanquished all dread of unjust censure  and she  wrote an invitation to henrietta enclosed in a letter to her mother     the answer of henrietta expressed her rapture at the proposal  and that  of mrs belfield made no objection but to the expence     cecilia  therefore  sent her own maid to travel with her into suffolk   with proper directions to pay for the journey     the gratitude of the delighted henrietta at the meeting was boundless   and her joy at so unexpected a mark of favour made her half wild   cecilia suffered it not to languish for want of kindness to support  it  she took her to her bosom  became the soother of all her cares  and  reposed in her  in return  every thought that led not to delvile     there  however  she was uniformly silent  solemnly and eternally parted  from him  far from trusting the secret of her former connexion to  henrietta  the whole study of her life was to drive the remembrance of  it from herself     henrietta now tasted a happiness to which as yet her whole life had been  a stranger  she was suddenly removed from turbulent vulgarity to the  enjoyment of calm elegance  and the gentleness of her disposition   instead of being tyrannically imposed upon  not only made her loved with  affection  but treated with the most scrupulous delicacy  cecilia had  her share in all the comfort she bestowed  she had now a friend to  oblige  and a companion to converse with  she communicated to her all  her schemes  and made her the partner of her benevolent excursions   she found her disposition as amiable upon trial  as her looks and her  manners had been engaging at first sight  and her constant presence and  constant sweetness  imperceptibly revived her spirits  and gave a new  interest to her existence     meantime mr monckton  who returned in about a fortnight to the grove   observed the encreasing influence of albany with the most serious  concern  the bounties of cecilia  extensive  magnificent  unlimited   were the theme of every tongue  and though sometimes censured and  sometimes admired  they were wondered at universally  he suffered her  for a while to go on without remonstrance  hoping her enthusiasm would  abate  as its novelty wore out  but finding that week following week was  still distinguished by some fresh act of beneficence  he grew so alarmed  and uneasy  he could restrain himself no longer  he spoke to her  with warmth  he represented her conduct as highly dangerous in its  consequence  he said she would but court impostors from every corner of  the kingdom  called albany a lunatic  whom she should rather avoid than  obey  and insinuated that if a report was spread of her proceedings  a  charity so prodigal  would excite such alarm  that no man would think  even her large and splendid fortune  would ensure him from ruin in  seeking her alliance     cecilia heard this exhortation without either terror or impatience  and  answered it with the utmost steadiness  his influence over her mind was  no longer uncontrolled  for though her suspicions were not strengthened   they had never been removed  and friendship has no foe so dangerous as  distrust  she thanked him  however  for his zeal  but assured him his  apprehensions were groundless  since though she acted from inclination   she acted not without thought  her income was very large  and she was  wholly without family or connection  to spend it merely upon herself  would be something still worse than extravagance  it must result from  wilfulness the most inexcusable  as her disposition was naturally  averse to luxury and expence  she might save indeed  but for whom  not a  creature had such a claim upon her  and with regard to herself  she was  so provided for it would be unnecessary  she would never  she declared   run in debt even for a week  but while her estate was wholly clear  she  would spend it without restriction     to his hint of any future alliance  she only said that those who  disapproved her conduct  would probably be those she should disapprove  in her turn  should such an event however take place  the retrenching  from that time all her present peculiar expences  would surely  in a  clear u     a year  leave her rich enough for any man  without making  it incumbent upon her at present  to deny herself the only pleasure she  could taste  in bestowing that money which to her was superfluous  upon  those who received it as the prolongation of their existence     a firmness so deliberate in a system he so much dreaded  greatly shocked  mr monckton  though it intimidated him from opposing it  he saw she was  too earnest  and too well satisfied she was right  to venture giving  her disgust by controverting her arguments  the conversation  therefore   ended with new discontent to himself  and with an impression upon  the mind of cecilia  that though he was zealous and friendly  he was  somewhat too worldly and suspicious     she went on  therefore  as before  distributing with a lavish hand  all she could spare from her own household  careful of nothing but of  guarding against imposition  which  though she sometimes unavoidably  endured  her discernment  and the activity of her investigating  diligence  saved her from suffering frequently  and the steadiness with  which she repulsed those whom she detected in deceit  was a check upon  tricks and fraud  though it could not wholly put a stop to them     money  to her  had long appeared worthless and valueless  it had failed  to procure her the establishment for which she once flattered herself  it seemed purposely designed  it had been disdained by the delviles   for the sake of whose connection she had alone ever truly rejoiced in  possessing it  and after such a conviction of its inefficacy to secure  her happiness  she regarded it as of little importance to herself  and  therefore thought it almost the due of those whose distresses gave it a  consequence to which with her it was a stranger     in this manner with cecilia passed the first winter of her majority   she had sedulously filled it with occupations  and her occupations had  proved fertile in keeping her mind from idleness  and in restoring it  to chearfulness  calls upon her attention so soothing  and avocations  so various for her time  had answered the great purpose for which  originally she had planned them  in almost forcing from her thoughts  those sorrows which  if indulged  would have rested in them incessantly         chapter viii     an alarm     the spring was now advancing  and the weather was remarkably fine  when  one morning  while cecilia was walking with mrs harrel and henrietta  on the lawn before her house  to which the last dinner bell was just  summoning them  to return  mrs harrel looked round and stopt at sight  of a gentleman galloping towards them  who in less than a minute  approached  and dismounting and leaving his horse to his servant  struck  them all at the same instant to be no other than young delvile     a sight so unexpected  so unaccountable  so wonderful  after an  absence so long  and to which they were mutually bound  almost wholly  over powered cecilia from surprise and a thousand other feelings  and  she caught mrs harrel by the arm  not knowing what she did  as if  for succour  while henrietta with scarce less  though much more glad  emotion  suddenly exclaimed    tis mr delvile   and sprang forward to  meet him     he had reached them  and in a voice that spoke hurry and perturbation   respectfully made his compliments to them all  before cecilia recovered  even the use of her feet  but no sooner were they restored to her  than  she employed them with the quickest motion in her power  still leaning  upon mrs harrel  to hasten into the house  her solemn promise to mrs  delvile became uppermost in her thoughts  and her surprise was soon  succeeded by displeasure  that thus  without any preparation  he forced  her to break it by an interview she had no means to prevent     just as they reached the entrance into the house  the butler came to  tell cecilia that dinner was upon the table  delvile then went up to  her  and said   may i wait upon you for one instant before  or after you  dine       i am engaged  sir   answered she  though hardly able to speak   for the  whole day       you will not  i hope  refuse to hear me   cried he  eagerly   i cannot  write what i have to say         there is no occasion that you should  sir   interrupted she   since i  should scarcely find time to read it      she then courtsied  though without looking at him  and went into the  house  delvile remaining in utter dismay  not daring  however wishing   to follow her  but when mrs harrel  much surprised at behaviour so  unusual from cecilia  approached him with some civil speeches  he  started  and wishing her good day  bowed  and remounted his horse   pursued by the soft eyes of henrietta till wholly out of sight     they then both followed cecilia to the dining parlour     had not mrs harrel been of this small party  the dinner would have been  served in vain  cecilia  still trembling with emotion  bewildered with  conjecture  angry with delvile for thus surprising her  angry with  herself for so severely receiving him  amazed what had tempted him to  such a violation of their joint agreement  and irresolute as much what  to wish as what to think  was little disposed for eating  and with  difficulty compelled herself to do the honours of her table     henrietta  whom the sight of delvile had at once delighted and  disturbed  whom the behaviour of cecilia had filled with wonder and  consternation  and whom the evident inquietude and disappointment which  that behaviour had given to delvile  had struck with grief and terror   could not swallow even a morsel  but having cut her meat about her  plate  gave it  untouched  to a servant     mrs harrel  however  though she had had her share in the surprise  had  wholly escaped all other emotion  and only concluded in her own mind   that cecilia could sometimes be out of humour and ill bred  as well as  the rest of the world     while the dessert was serving  a note was brought to henrietta  which a  servant was waiting in great haste to have answered     henrietta  stranger to all forms of politeness  though by nature soft   obliging and delicate  opened it immediately  she started as she cast  her eye over it  but blushed  sparkled  and looked enchanted  and  hastily rising  without even a thought of any apology  ran out of the  room to answer it     cecilia  whose quick eye  by a glance unavoidable  had seen the hand  of delvile  was filled with new amazement at the sight  as soon as the  servants were gone  she begged mrs harrel to excuse her  and went to her  own apartment     here  in a few minutes  she was followed by henrietta  whose countenance  beamed with pleasure  and whose voice spoke tumultuous delight   my  dear  dear miss beverley   she cried   i have such a thing to tell  you   you would never guess it   i don t know how to believe it  myself   but mr delvile has written to me   he has indeed  that note was  from him   i have been locking it up  for fear of accidents  but i ll  run and fetch it  that you may see it yourself      she then ran away  leaving cecilia much perplexed  much uneasy  for herself  and both grieved and alarmed for the too tender  too  susceptible henrietta  who was thus easily the sport of every airy and  credulous hope      if i did not shew it you   cried henrietta  running back in a  moment   you would never think it possible  for it is to make such a  request  that it has frightened me almost out of my wits      cecilia then read the note      to miss belfield      mr delvile presents his compliments to miss belfield  and begs to  be permitted to wait upon her for a few minutes  at any time in the  afternoon she will be so good as to appoint      only think   cried the rapturous henrietta   it was  me   poor simple   me   of all people  that he wanted so to speak with   i am sure i  thought a different thought when he went away  but do  dearest miss  beverley  tell me this one thing  what do you think he can have to say  to me       indeed   replied cecilia  extremely embarrassed   it is impossible for  me to conjecture       if  you  can t  i am sure  then  it is no wonder  i  can t  and i have  been thinking of a million of things in a minute  it can t be about any  business  because i know nothing in the world of any business  and it  can t be about my brother  because he would go to our house in town  about him  and there he would see him himself  and it can t be about my  dear miss beverley  because then he would have written the note to her  and it can t be about any body else  because i know nobody else of his  acquaintance      thus went on the sanguine henrietta  settling whom and what it could   not  be about  till she left but the one thing to which her wishes  pointed that it  could  be about  cecilia heard her with true  compassion  certain that she was deceiving herself with imaginations  the most pernicious  yet unable to know how to quell them  while in such  doubt and darkness herself     this conversation was soon interrupted  by a message that a gentleman in  the parlour begged to speak with miss belfield      o dearest  dearest miss beverley   cried henrietta  with encreasing  agitation   what in the world shall i say to him  advise me  pray advise  me  for i can t think of a single word       impossible  my dear henrietta  unless i knew what he would say to you       o but i can guess  i can guess    cried she  her cheeks glowing  while  her whole frame shook   and i sha n t know what in the whole world to  answer him  i know i shall behave like a fool   i know i shall disgrace  myself sadly      cecilia  truly sorry delvile should see her in such emotion  endeavoured  earnestly to compose her  though never less tranquil herself  but  she could not succeed  and she went down stairs with expectations of  happiness almost too potent for her reason     not such were those of cecilia  a dread of some new conflict took  possession of her mind  that mind so long tortured with struggles  so  lately restored to serenity     henrietta soon returned  but not the same henrietta she went   the  glow  the hope  the flutter were all over  she looked pale and wan  but  attempting  as she entered the room  to call up a smile  she failed  and  burst into tears     cecilia threw her arms round her neck  and tried to console her  but   happy to hide her face in her bosom  she only gave the freer indulgence  to her grief  and rather melted than comforted by her tenderness  sobbed  aloud     cecilia too easily conjectured the disappointment she had met  to pain  her by asking it  she forbore even to gratify her own curiosity by  questions that could not but lead to her mortification  and suffering  her therefore to take her own time for what she had to communicate  she  hung over her in silence with the most patient pity     henrietta was very sensible of this kindness  though she knew not half  its merit  but it was a long time before she could articulate  for  sobbing  that  all  mr delvile wanted  at last  was only to beg she  would acquaint miss beverley  that he had done himself the honour of  waiting upon her with a message from mrs delvile      from mrs delvile   exclaimed cecilia  all emotion in her turn   good  heaven  how much  then  have i been to blame  where is he now   where  can i send to him   tell me  my sweet henrietta  this instant       oh madam   cried henrietta  bursting into a fresh flood of tears   how  foolish have i been to open my silly heart to you   he is come to pay  his addresses to you   i am sure he is         no  no  no   cried cecilia   indeed he is not   but i must  i ought to  see him   where  my love  is he        in the parlour   waiting for an answer        cecilia  who at any other time would have been provoked at such a delay  in the delivery of a message so important  felt now nothing but concern  for henrietta  whom she hastily kissed  but instantly  however  quitted   and hurried to delvile  with expectations almost equally sanguine as  those her poor friend but the moment before had crushed      oh now   thought she   if at last mrs delvile herself has relented   with what joy will i give up all reserve  all disguise  and frankly avow  the faithful affection of my heart      delvile received her not with the eagerness with which he had first  addressed her  he looked extremely disturbed  and  even after her  entrance  undetermined how to begin     she waited  however  his explanation in silence  and  after an  irresolute pause  he said  with a gravity not wholly free from  resentment   i presumed  madam  to wait upon you from the permission of  my mother  but i believe i have obtained it so late  that the influence  i hoped from it is past       i had no means  sir   answered she  chearfully   to know that you  came from her  i should else have received her commands without any  hesitation       i would thank you for the honour you do her  were it less pointedly  exclusive  i have  however  no right of reproach  yet suffer me to ask   could you  madam  after such a parting  after a renunciation so absolute  of all future claim upon you  which though extorted from me by duty  i  was bound  having promised  to fulfil by principle  could you imagine me  so unsteady  so dishonourable  as to obtrude myself into your presence  while that promise was still in force       i find   cried cecilia  in whom a secret hope every moment grew  stronger   i have been too hasty  i did indeed believe mrs delvile would  never authorise such a visit  but as you have so much surprised me  i  have a right to your pardon for a little doubt       there spoke miss beverley   cried delvile  reanimating at this little  apology   the same  the unaltered miss beverley i hoped to find   yet   is  she unaltered  am i not too precipitate  and is the tale i have  heard about belfield a dream  an error  a falsehood       but that so quick a succession of quarrels   said cecilia  half  smiling   would be endless perplexity  i  now  would be affronted that  you can ask me such a question       had i  indeed   thought  it a question   cried he   i would not have  asked it  but never for a moment did i credit it  till the rigour of  your repulse alarmed me  you have condescended  now  to account for  that  and i am therefore encouraged to make known to you the purpose  of my venturing this visit  yet not with confidence shall i speak  if  scarce even with hope   it is a purpose that is the offspring of  despair        one thing  sir   cried cecilia  who now became frightened again   let  me say before you proceed  if your purpose has not the sanction of mrs  delvile  as well as your visit  i would gladly be excused hearing it   since i shall most certainly refuse it       i would mention nothing   answered he   without her concurrence   she has given it me  and my father himself has permitted my present  application       good heaven   cried cecilia   is it possible   clasping her hands  together in the eagerness of her surprise and delight       is it possible    repeated delvile  with a look of rapture   ah miss  beverley   once my own cecilia   do you  can you  wish  it possible       no  no   cried she  while pleasure and expectation sparkled in her  eyes   i wish nothing about it   yet tell me how it has happened   i am   curious    added she  smiling   though not interested in it       what hope would this sweetness give me   cried he   were my scheme  almost any other than it is   but you cannot   no  it would be  unreasonable  it would be madness to expect your compliance   it is next  to madness even in me to wish it   but how shall a man who is desperate  be prudent and circumspect       spare  spare yourself   cried the ingenuous cecilia   this  unnecessary  pain   you will find from me no unnecessary scruples       you know not what you say   all noble as you are  the sacrifice i have  to propose        speak it   cried she   with confidence  speak it even with certainty of  success  i will be wholly undisguised  and openly  honestly own to you   that no proposal  no sacrifice can be mentioned  to which i will not  instantly agree  if first it has had the approbation of mrs delvile      delvile s gratitude and thanks for a concession never before so  voluntarily made to him  interrupted for a while  even his power of  explaining himself  and now  for the first time  cecilia s sincerity was  chearful  since now  for the first time  it seemed opposed by no duty     when still  therefore  he hesitated  she herself held out her hand to  him  saying   what must i do more  must i offer this pledge to you       for my life would i not resign it   cried he  delightedly receiving it    but oh  how soon will you withdraw it  when the only terms upon which  i can hold it  are those of making it sign from itself its natural right  and inheritance      cecilia  not comprehending him  only looked amazed  and he proceeded      can you  for my sake  make such a sacrifice as this  can you for a man  who for yours is not permitted to give up his name  give up yourself the  fortune of your late uncle  consent to such settlements as i can  make upon you from my own  part with so splendid an income wholly and  for ever   and with only your paternal l       condescend to become  mine  as if your uncle had never existed  and you had been heiress to no  other wealth      this  indeed  was a stroke to cecilia unequalled by any she had met   and more cruel than any she could have in reserve  at the proposal of  parting with her uncle s fortune  which  desirable as it was  had as  yet been only productive to her of misery  her heart  disinterested  and  wholly careless of money  was prompt to accede to the condition  but at  the mention of her paternal fortune  that fortune  of which  now  not  the smallest vestige remained  horror seized all her faculties  she  turned pale  she trembled  she involuntarily drew back her hand  and  betrayed  by speechless agitation  the sudden agonies of her soul     delvile  struck by this evident dismay  instantly concluded his plan  had disgusted her  he waited some minutes in anxious expectation of an  answer  but finding her silence continued while her emotion encreased   the deepest crimson dyed his face  and unable to check his chagrin   though not daring to confess his disappointment  he suddenly quitted  her  and walked  in much disorder  about the room  but soon recovering  some composure  from the assistance of pride   pardon  madam   he said    a trial such as no man can be vindicated in making  i have indulged a  romantic whim  which your better judgment disapproves  and i receive but  the mortification my presumption deserved       you know not then   said cecilia  in a faint voice   my inability to  comply       your ability or inability  i presume  are elective       oh no   my power is lost  my fortune itself is gone       impossible  utterly impossible   cried he with vehemence      oh that it were   your father knows it but too well       my father       did he  then  never hint it to you       oh distraction   cried delvile   what horrible confirmation is coming    and again he walked away  as if wanting courage to hear her     cecilia was too much shocked to force upon him her explanation  but  presently returning to her  he said    you   only  could have made this  credible       had you  then  actually heard it       oh i had heard it as the most infamous of falsehoods  my heart swelled  with indignation at so villainous a calumny  and had it not come from my  father  my resentment at it had been inveterate       alas   cried cecilia   the fact is undeniable  yet the circumstances  you may have heard with it  are i doubt not exaggerated       exaggerated indeed   he answered   i was told you had been surprised  concealed with belfield in a back room  i was told that your parental  fortune was totally exhausted  and that during your minority you had  been a dealer with jews   i was told all this by my father  you may  believe i had else not easily been made hear it       yet thus far   said she   he told you but what is true  though        true   interrupted delvile  with a start almost frantic   oh never   then  was truth so scandalously wronged   i denied the whole charge  i  disbelieved every syllable   i pledged my own honour to prove every  assertion false       generous delvile   cried cecilia  melting into tears   this is what i  expected from you  and  believe me  in  your  integrity my reliance had  been similar       why does miss beverley weep   cried he  softened  and approaching her    and why has she given me this alarm  these things must at least  have been misrepresented  deign  then  to clear up a mystery in which  suspense is torture      cecilia  then  with what precision and clearness her agitation allowed  her  related the whole history of her taking up the money of the jew  for mr harrel  and told  without reserve  the reason of her trying  to abscond from his father at mrs belfield s  delvile listened to her  account with almost an agony of attention  now admiring her conduct   now resenting her ill usage  now compassionating her losses  but though  variously moved by different parts  receiving from the whole the delight  he most coveted in the establishment of her innocence     thanks and applause the warmest  both accompanied and followed her  narration  and then  at her request  he related in return the several  incidents and circumstances to which he had owed the permission of this  visit     he had meant immediately to have gone abroad  but the indisposition  of his mother made him unwilling to leave the kingdom till her health  seemed in a situation less precarious  that time  however  came not  the  winter advanced  and she grew evidently worse  he gave over  therefore   his design till the next spring  when  if she were able  it was her  desire to try the south of france for her recovery  whither he meant to  conduct her     but  during his attendance upon her  the plan he had just mentioned  occurred to him  and he considered how much greater would be his chance  of happiness in marrying cecilia with scarce any fortune at all  than  in marrying another with the largest  he was convinced she was far other  than expensive  or a lover of shew  and soon flattered himself she might  be prevailed upon to concur with him  that in living together  though  comparatively upon little  they should mutually be happier than in  living asunder upon much     when he started this scheme to his mother  she heard it with mingled  admiration of his disinterestedness  and regret at its occasion  yet  the loftiness of her own mind  her high personal value for cecilia   her anxiety to see her son finally settled while she lived  lest his  disappointment should keep him single from a lasting disgust  joined to  a dejection of spirits from an apprehension that her interference had  been cruel  all favoured his scheme  and forbid her resistance  she  had often protested  in their former conflicts  that had cecilia  been portionless  her objections had been less than to an estate so  conditioned  and that to give to her son a woman so exalted in herself   she would have conquered the mere opposition of interest  though that  of family honour she held invincible  delvile now called upon her to  remember those words  and ever strict in fidelity  she still promised to  abide by them     ah  thought cecilia  is virtue  then  as inconsistent as vice  and can  the same character be thus high souled  thus nobly disinterested with  regard to riches  whose pride is so narrow and so insurmountable  with  respect to family prejudice     yet such a sacrifice from cecilia herself  whose income intitled her  to settlements the most splendid  mrs delvile thought scarcely to be  solicited  but as her son was conscious he gave up in expectation no  less than she would give up in possession  he resolved upon making the  experiment  and felt an internal assurance of success     this matter being finally settled with his mother  the harder task  remained of vanquishing the father  by whom  and before whom the name of  cecilia was never mentioned  not even after his return from town   though loaded with imaginary charges against her  mr delvile held it  a diminution of his own in the honour of his son  to suppose he wanted  still fresh motives for resigning her  he kept  therefore  to himself  the ill opinion he brought down  as a resource in case of danger  but  a resource he disdained to make use of  unless driven to it by absolute  necessity     but  at the new proposal of his son  the accusation held in reserve  broke out  he called cecilia a dabler with jews  and said she had been  so from the time of her uncle s death  he charged her with the grossest  general extravagance  to which he added a most insidious attack upon her  character  drawn from her visits at belfield s of long standing  as well  as the particular time when he had himself surprised her concealed with  the young man in a back parlour  and he asserted  that most of the  large sums she was continually taking up from her fortune  were lavished  without scruple upon this dangerous and improper favourite     delvile had heard this accusation with a rage scarce restrained from  violence  confident in her innocence  he boldly pronounced the whole a  forgery  and demanded the author of such cruel defamation  mr delvile   much offended  refused to name any authority  but consented  with an air  of triumph  to abide by the effect of his own proposal  and gave him a  supercilious promise no longer to oppose the marriage  if the terms he  meant to offer to miss beverley  of renouncing her uncle s estate  and  producing her father s fortune  were accepted      o little did i credit   said delvile in conclusion   that he knew  indeed so well this last condition was impracticable  his assertions  were without proof  i thought them prejudiced surmises  and i came in  the full hope i should convict him of his error  my mother  too  who  warmly and even angrily defended you  was as firmly satisfied as myself  that the whole was a mistake  and that enquiry would prove your fortune  as undiminished as your purity  how will she be shocked at the tale  i have now to unfold  how irritated at your injuries from harrel  how  grieved that your own too great benevolence should be productive of such  black aspersions upon your character       i have been   cried cecilia   too facile and too unguarded  yet always   at the moment  i seemed but guided by common humanity  i have ever  thought myself secure of more wealth than i could require  and regarded  the want of money as an evil from which i was unavoidably exempted  my  own fortune  therefore  appeared to me of small consequence  while the  revenue of my uncle insured me perpetual prosperity   oh had i foreseen  this moment        would you  then  have listened to my romantic proposal       would i have listened   do you not see too plainly i could not have  hesitated       oh yet  then  most generous of human beings  yet then be mine  by our  own oeconomy we will pay off our mortgages  by living a while abroad   we will clear all our estates  i will still keep the name to which my  family is bigotted  and my gratitude for your compliance shall make you  forget what you lose by it       speak not to me such words   cried cecilia  hastily rising   your  friends will not listen to them  neither  therefore  must i       my friends   cried he with energy   are henceforth out of the question   my father s concurrence with a proposal he  knew  you had not power to  grant  was in fact a mere permission to insult you  for if  instead of  dark charges  he had given any authority for your losses  i had myself  spared you the shock you have so undeservedly received from hearing  it   but to consent to a plan which  could  not be accepted   to make me  a tool to offer indignity to miss beverley   he has released me from his  power by so erroneous an exertion of it  and my own honour has a claim  to which his commands must give place  that honour binds me to miss  beverley as forcibly as my admiration  and no voice but her own shall  determine my future destiny       that voice  then   said cecilia   again refers you to your mother   mr delvile  indeed  has not treated me kindly  and this last mock  concession was unnecessary cruelty  but mrs delvile merits my utmost  respect  and i will listen to nothing which has not her previous  sanction       but will her sanction be sufficient  and may i hope  in obtaining it   the security of yours       when i have said i will hear nothing without it  may you not almost  infer  i will refuse nothing with it      the acknowledgments he would now have poured forth  cecilia would not  hear  telling him  with some gaiety  they were yet unauthorized by mrs  delvile  she insisted upon his leaving her immediately  and never again  returning  without his mother s express approbation  with regard to his  father  she left him totally to his own inclination  she had received  from him nothing but pride and incivility  and determined to skew  publicly her superior respect for mrs delvile  by whose discretion and  decision she was content to abide      will you not  then  from time to time   cried delvile   suffer me to  consult with you       no  no   answered she   do not ask it  i have never been insincere  with you  never but from motives not to be overcome  reserved even for  a moment  i have told you i will put every thing into the power of  mrs delvile  but i will not a second time risk my peace by any action  unknown to her      delvile gratefully acknowledged her goodness  and promised to require  nothing more  he then obeyed her by taking leave  eager himself to put  an end to this new uncertainty  and supplicating only that her good  wishes might follow his enterprise     and thus  again  was wholly broken the tranquility of cecilia  new  hopes  however faint  awakened all her affections  and strong fears  but  too reasonable  interrupted her repose  her destiny  once more  was  as undecided as ever  and the expectations she had crushed  retook  possession of her heart     the suspicions she had conceived of mr monckton again occurred to her   though unable to ascertain and unwilling to believe them  she tried to  drive them from her thoughts  she lamented  however  with bitterness   her unfortunate connexion with mr harrel  whose unworthy impositions  upon her kindness of temper and generosity  now proved to her an evil  far more serious and extensive  than in the midst of her repugnance to  them she had ever apprehended         chapter ix     a suspense     delvile had been gone but a short time  before henrietta  her eyes still  red  though no longer streaming  opened the parlour door  and asked if  she might come in     cecilia wished to be alone  yet could not refuse her      well  madam   cried she  with a forced smile  and constrained air of  bravery   did not i guess right       in what   said cecilia  unwilling to understand her      in what i said would happen   i am sure you know what i mean      cecilia  extremely embarrassed  made no answer  she much regretted the  circumstances which had prevented an earlier communication  and was  uncertain whether  now  it would prove most kind or most cruel to  acquaint her with what was in agitation  which  should it terminate in  nothing  was unnecessarily wounding her delicacy for the openness of her  confidence  and which  however serviceable it might prove to her in  the end  was in the means so rough and piercing she felt the utmost  repugnance to the experiment      you think me  madam  too free   said henrietta   in asking such a  question  and indeed your kindness has been so great  it may well make  me forget myself  but if it does  i am sure i deserve you should send me  home directly  and then there is not much fear i shall soon be brought  to my senses       no  my dear henrietta  i can never think you too free  i have told  you already every thing i thought you would have pleasure in hearing   whatever i have concealed  i have been fearful would only pain you       i have  deserved   madam   said she  with spirit   to be pained  for  i have behaved with the folly of a baby  i am very angry with myself  indeed  i was old enough to have known better   and i ought to have been  wise enough       you must then be angry with yourself  next   said cecilia  anxious  to re encourage her   for all the love that i bear you  since to your  openness and frankness it was entirely owing       but there are some things that people should  not  be frank in   however  i am only come now to beg you will tell me  madam  when it is  to be   and don t think i ask out of nothing but curiosity  for i have a  very great reason for it indeed       what be  my dear henrietta   you are very rapid in your ideas       i will tell you  madam  what my reason is  i shall go away to my  own home   and so i would if it were ten times a worse home than it  is   just exactly the day before  because afterwards i shall never like  to look that gentleman in the face   never  never   for married ladies i  know are not to be trusted       be not apprehensive  you have no occasion  whatever may be my fate  i  will never be so treacherous as to betray my beloved henrietta to  any   body       may i ask you  madam  one question       certainly       why did all this never happen before       indeed   cried cecilia  much distressed   i know not that it will  happen now       why what  dear madam  can hinder it       a thousand  thousand things  nothing can be less secure       and then i am still as much puzzled as ever  i heard  a good while ago   and we all heard that it was to be  and i thought that it was no wonder   i am sure  for i used often to think it was just what was most likely   but afterwards we heard it was no such thing  and from that moment i  always believed there had been nothing at all in it       i must speak to you  i find  with sincerity  my affairs have long been  in strange perplexity  i have not known myself what to expect  one day  has perpetually reversed the prospect of another  and my mind has been  in a state of uncertainty and disorder  that has kept it  that still  keeps it from comfort and from rest       this surprises me indeed  madam  i thought  you  were all happiness   but i was sure you deserved it  and i thought you had it for that  reward  and this has been the thing that has made me behave so wrong   for i took it into my head i might tell you every thing  because i  concluded it could be nothing to you  for if great people loved one  another  i always supposed they married directly  poor people  indeed   must stay till they are able to settle  but what in the whole world   thought i  if they like one another  should hinder such a rich lady as  miss beverley from marrying such a rich gentleman at once      cecilia now  finding there was no longer any chance for concealment   thought it better to give the poor henrietta at least the gratification  of unreserved confidence  which might somewhat sooth her uneasiness by  proving her reliance in her faith  she frankly  therefore  confessed  to her the whole of her situation  henrietta wept at the recital with  bitterness  thought mr delvile a monster  and mrs delvile herself scarce  human  pitied cecilia with unaffected tenderness  and wondered that the  person could exist who had the heart to give grief to young delvile  she  thanked her most gratefully for reposing such trust in her  and cecilia  made use of this opportunity  to enforce the necessity of her struggling  more seriously to recover her indifferency     she promised she would not fail  and forbore steadily from that time to  name delvile any more  but the depression of her spirits shewed she had  suffered a disappointment such as astonished even cecilia  though modest  and humble  she had conceived hopes the most romantic  and though  she denied  even to herself  any expectations from delvile  she  involuntarily nourished them with the most sanguine simplicity  to  compose and to strengthen her became the whole business of cecilia  who   during her present suspense  could find no other employment in which she  could take any interest     mr monckton  to whom nothing was unknown that related to cecilia  was  soon informed of delvile s visit  and hastened in the utmost alarm   to learn its event  she had now lost all the pleasure she had formerly  derived from confiding in him  but though averse and confused  could not  withstand his enquiries     unlike the tender henrietta s was his disappointment at this relation   and his rage at such repeated trials was almost more than he could curb   he spared neither the delviles for their insolence of mutability in  rejecting or seeking her at their pleasure  nor herself for her easiness  of submission in being thus the dupe of their caprices  the subject  was difficult for cecilia to dilate upon  she wished to clear  as he  deserved  delvile himself from any share in the censure  and she felt  hurt and offended at the charge of her own improper readiness  yet shame  and pride united in preventing much vindication of either  and she heard  almost in silence what with pain she bore to hear at all     he now saw  with inexpressible disturbance  that whatever was his  power to make her uneasy  he had none to make her retract  and that the  conditional promise she had given delvile to be wholly governed by his  mother  she was firm in regarding to be as sacred as one made at the  altar     perceiving this  he dared trust his temper with no further debate  he  assumed a momentary calmness for the purpose of taking leave of her   and with pretended good wishes for her happiness  whatever might be her  determination  he stifled the reproaches with which his whole heart was  swelling  and precipitately left her     cecilia  affected by his earnestness  yet perplexed in all her opinions   was glad to be relieved from useless exhortations  and not sorry  in her  present uncertainty  that his visit was not repeated     she neither saw nor heard from delvile for a week  and augured nothing  but evil from such delay  the following letter then came by the post      to miss beverley  april  d           i must write without comments  for i dare not trust myself with making  any  i must write without any beginning address  for i know not how you  will permit me to address you     i have lived a life of tumult since last compelled to leave you  and  when it may subside  i am still in utter ignorance     the affecting account of the losses you have suffered through your  beneficence to the harrels  and the explanatory one of the calumnies you  have sustained from your kindness to the belfields  i related with the  plainness which alone i thought necessary to make them felt  i then told  the high honour i had received  in meeting with no other repulse to my  proposal  than was owing to an inability to accede to it  and informed  my mother of the condescending powers with which you had invested her   in conclusion i mentioned my new scheme  and firmly  before i would  listen to any opposition  i declared that though wholly to their  decision i left the relinquishing my own name or your fortune  i was not  only by your generosity more internally yours than ever  but that since  again i had ventured  and with permission to apply to you  i should hold  myself hence forward unalterably engaged to you     and so i do  and so i shall  nor  after a renewal so public  will any  prohibition but yours have force to keep me from throwing myself at your  feet     my father s answer i will not mention  i would i could forget it  his  prejudices are irremediable  his resolutions are inflexible  who or what  has worked him into an animosity so irreclaimable  i cannot conjecture   nor will he tell  but something darkly mysterious has part in his wrath  and his injustice     my mother was much affected by your reference to herself  words of the  sweetest praise broke repeatedly from her  no other such woman  she  said  existed  no other such instance could be found of fidelity  so exalted  her son must have no heart but for low and mercenary  selfishness  if  after a proof of regard so unexampled  he could bear  to live without her  oh how did such a sentence from lips so highly  reverenced  animate  delight  confirm  and oblige me at once     the displeasure of my father at this declaration was dreadful  his  charges  always as improbable as injurious  now became too horrible  for my ears  he disbelieved you had taken up the money for harrel  he  discredited that you visited the belfields for henrietta  passion not  merely banished his justice  but  clouded his reason  and i soon left  the room  that at least i might not hear the aspersions he forbid me to  answer     i left not  however  your fame to a weak champion  my mother defended it  with all the spirit of truth  and all the confidence of similar virtue   yet they parted without conviction  and so mutually irritated with each  other  that they agreed to meet no more     this was too terrible  and i instantly consolidated my resentment to  my father  and my gratitude to my mother  into concessions and  supplications to both  i could not  however  succeed  my mother was  deeply offended  my father was sternly inexorable  nor here rests  the evil of their dissention  for the violence of the conflict has  occasioned a return more alarming than ever of the illness of my mother     all her faith in her recovery is now built upon going abroad  she is  earnest to set off immediately  but dr lyster has advised her to make  london in her way  and have a consultation of physicians before she  departs     to this she has agreed  and we are now upon the road thither     such is  at present  the melancholy state of my affairs  my mother   advised  me to write  forgive me  therefore  that i waited not  something more decisive to say  i could prevail upon neither party  to meet before the journey  nor could i draw from my father the base  fabricator of the calumnies by which he has been thus abused     unhappily  i have nothing more to add  and whether intelligence  such  as this  or total suspense  would be least irksome  i know not  if my  mother bears her journey tolerably well  i have yet one more effort  to make  and of that the success or the failure will be instantly  communicated to miss beverley  by her eternally devoted  but half  distracted     mortimer delvile     scarcely could cecilia herself decide whether this comfortless letter  or none at all were preferable  the implacability of mr delvile was  shocking  but his slandering her character was still more intolerable   yet the praises of the mother  and her generous vindication  joined to  the invariable reliance of delvile upon her innocence  conferred upon  her an honour that offered some alleviation     the mention of a fabricator again brought mr monckton to her mind  and  not all her unwillingness to think him capable of such treachery  could  now root out her suspicions  delvile s temper  however  she knew was too  impetuous to be trusted with this conjecture  and her fear of committing  injustice being thus seconded by prudence  she determined to keep to  herself doubts that could not without danger be divulged     she communicated briefly to henrietta  who looked her earnest curiosity   the continuance of her suspense  and to her own fate henrietta became  somewhat more reconciled  when she saw that no station in life rendered  happiness certain or permanent         chapter x     a relation     another week past still without any further intelligence  cecilia was  then summoned to the parlour  and to delvile himself     he looked hurried and anxious  yet the glow of his face  and the  animation of his eyes  immediately declared he at least came not to take  leave of her      can you forgive   cried he   the dismal and unsatisfactory letter i  wrote you  i would not disobey you twice in the same manner  and i could  not till now have written in any other       the consultation with the physicians  then   said cecilia   is over       alas  yes  and the result is most alarming  they all agree my mother is  in a dangerous way  and they rather forbear to oppose  than advise her  going abroad  but upon that she is earnestly bent  and intends to set  out without delay  i shall return to her  therefore  with all speed  and  mean not to take any rest till i have seen her      cecilia expressed with tenderness her sorrow for mrs delvile  nor were  her looks illiberal in including her son in her concern      i must hasten   he cried   to the credentials by which i am authorised  for coming  and i must hasten to prove if miss beverley has not  flattered my mother in her appeal      he then informed her that mrs delvile  apprehensive for herself  and  softened for him by the confession of her danger  which she had extorted  from her physicians  had tenderly resolved upon making one final effort  for his happiness  and ill and impatient as she was  upon deferring her  journey to wait its effect     generously  therefore  giving up her own resentment  she wrote to mr  delvile in terms of peace and kindness  lamenting their late dissention   and ardently expressing her desire to be reconciled to him before she  left england  she told him the uncertainty of her recovery which had  been acknowledged by her physicians  who had declared a calmer mind  was more essential to her than a purer air  she then added  that such  serenity was only to be given her  by the removal of her anxiety at the  comfortless state of her son  she begged him  therefore  to make known  the author of miss beverley s defamation  assuring him  that upon  enquiry  he would find her character and her fame as unsullied as his  own  and strongly representing  that after the sacrifice to which she  had consented  their son would be utterly dishonourable in thinking of  any other connexion  she then to this reasoning joined the most earnest  supplication  protesting  in her present disordered state  of health   her life might pay the forfeiture of her continual uneasiness      i held out   she concluded   while his personal dignity  and the honour  of his name and family were endangered  but where interest alone is  concerned  and that interest is combated by the peace of his mind  and  the delicacy of his word  my opposition is at an end  and though our  extensive and well founded views for a splendid alliance are abolished   you will agree with me hereafter  upon a closer inspection  that the  object for whom he relinquishes them  offers in herself the noblest  reparation      cecilia felt gratified  humbled  animated and depressed at once by this  letter  of which delvile brought her a copy   and what   cried she   was  the answer       i cannot in decency   he replied   speak my opinion of it  read it  yourself   and let me hear yours       to the honourable mrs delvile      your extraordinary letter  madam  has extremely surprised me  i had been  willing to hope the affair over from the time my disapprobation of it  was formally announced  i am sorry you are so much indisposed  but i  cannot conclude your health would be restored by my acceding to a plan  so derogatory to my house  i disapprove it upon every account  not only  of the name and the fortune  but the lady herself  i have reasons more  important than those i assign  but they are such as i am bound in  honour not to mention  after such a declaration  nobody  i presume  will  affront me by asking them  her defence you have only from herself   her accusation i have received from authority less partial  i command   therefore  that my son  upon pain of my eternal displeasure  may never  speak to me on the subject again  and i hope  madam  from you the same  complaisance to my request  i cannot explain myself further  nor is it  necessary  it is no news  i flatter myself  to mortimer delvile or his  mother  that i do nothing without reason  and i believe nothing upon  slight grounds     a few cold compliments concerning her journey  and the re establishment  of her health  concluded the letter     cecilia  having read  hastily returned it  and indignantly said   my  opinion  sir  upon this letter  must surely be yours  that we had done  wiser  long since  to have spared your mother and ourselves  those vain  and fruitless conflicts which we ought better to have foreseen were  liable to such a conclusion  now  at least  let them be ended  and let  us not pursue disgrace wilfully  after suffering from it with so much  rigour involuntarily       o no   cried delvile   rather let us now spurn it for ever  those  conflicts must indeed be ended  but not by a separation still more  bitter than all of them      he then told her  that his mother  highly offended to observe by the  extreme coldness of this letter  the rancour he still nourished for  the contest preceding her leaving him  no longer now refused even her  separate consent  for a measure which she thought her son absolutely  engaged to take      good heaven   cried cecilia  much amazed   this from mrs delvile   a  separate consent         she has always maintained   he answered   an independent mind   always judged for herself  and refused all other arbitration  when so  impetuously she parted us  my father s will happened to be her s  and  thence their concurrence  my father  of a temper immoveable and stern   retains stubbornly the prejudices which once have taken possession  of him  my mother  generous as fiery  and noble as proud  is open to  conviction  and no sooner convinced  than ingenuous in acknowledging it   and thence their dissention  from my father i may hope forgiveness  but  must never expect concession  from my mother i may hope all she ought  to grant  for pardon but her vehemence   and she has every great quality  that can dignify human nature      cecilia  whose affection and reverence for mrs delvile were unfeigned   and who loved in her son this filial enthusiasm  readily concurred with  him in praising her  and sincerely esteemed her the first among women      now  then   cried he  with earnestness   now is the time when your  generous admiration of her is put to the test  see what she writes  to you   she has left to me all explanation  but i insisted upon some  credential  lest you should believe i only owed her concurrence to a  happy dream      cecilia in much trepidation took the letter  and hastily run it over      to miss beverley      misery  my sweet young friend  has long been busy with us all  much have  we owed to the clash of different interests  much to that rapacity  which to enjoy any thing  demands every thing  and much to that general  perverseness which labours to place happiness in what is with held   thus do we struggle on till we can struggle no longer  the felicity  with which we trifle  at best is but temporary  and before reason and  reflection shew its value  sickness and sorrow are commonly become  stationary     be it yours  my love  and my son s  to profit by the experience  while  you pity the errors  of the many who illustrate this truth  your mutual  partiality has been mutually unfortunate  and must always continue  so for the interests of both  but how blind is it to wait  in our own  peculiar lots  for that perfection of enjoyment we can all see wanting  in the lot of others  my expectations for my son had  outstepped the  modesty of  probability  i looked for rank and high birth  with  the fortune of cecilia  and cecilia s rare character  alas  a new  constellation in the heavens might as rationally have been looked for     my extravagance  however  has been all for his felicity  dearer to me  than life   dearer to me than all things but his own honour  let us but  save that  and then let wealth  ambition  interest  grandeur and pride   since they cannot constitute his happiness  be removed from destroying  it  i will no longer play the tyrant that  weighing good and evil by my  own feelings and opinions  insists upon his acting by the notions i have  formed  whatever misery they may bring him by opposing all his own     i leave the kingdom with little reason to expect i shall return to it   i leave it  oh blindness of vanity and passion   from the effect of  that violence with which so lately i opposed what now i am content to  advance  but the extraordinary resignation to which you have agreed   shews your heart so wholly my son s  and so even more than worthy the  whole possession of his  that it reflects upon him an honour more bright  and more alluring  than any the most illustrious other alliance could  now confer     i would fain see you ere i go  lest i should see you no more  fain  ratify by word of mouth the consent that by word of mouth i so  absolutely refused  i know not how to come to suffolk   is it not  possible you can come to london  i am told you leave to me the  arbitration of your fate  in giving you to my son  i best shew my sense  of such an honour     hasten then  my love  to town  that i may see you once more  wait no  longer a concurrence thus unjustly with held  but hasten  that i may  bless the daughter i have so often wished to own  that i may entreat her  forgiveness for all the pain i have occasioned her  and committing to  her charge the future happiness of my son  fold to my maternal heart the  two objects most dear to it     augusta delvile         cecilia wept over this letter with tenderness  grief and alarm  but  declared  had it even summoned her to follow her abroad  she could not   after reading it  have hesitated in complying      o now  then   cried delvile   let our long suspenses end  hear me with  the candour  my mother has already listened to me  be mine  my cecilia   at once   and force me not  by eternal scruples  to risk another  separation       good heaven  sir   cried cecilia  starting   in such a state as mrs  delvile thinks herself  would you have her journey delayed       no  not a moment  i would but ensure you mine  and go with her all over  the world       wild and impossible   and what is to be done with mr delvile       it is on his account wholly i am thus earnestly precipitate  if i do  not by an immediate marriage prevent his further interference  all i  have already suffered may again be repeated  and some fresh contest with  my mother may occasion another relapse      cecilia  who now understood him  ardently protested she would not listen  for a moment to any clandestine expedient     he besought her to be patient  and then anxiously represented to  her their peculiar situations  all application to his father he was  peremptorily forbid making  all efforts to remove his prejudices their  impenetrable mystery prevented  a public marriage  therefore  with such  obstacles  would almost irritate him to phrenzy  by its daring defiance  of his prohibition and authority      alas   exclaimed cecilia   we can never do right but in parting       say it not   cried he   i conjure you  we shall yet live  i hope  to  prove the contrary       and can you  then   cried she  reproachfully   oh mr delvile  can you  again urge me to enter your family in secret       i grieve  indeed   he answered   that your goodness should so severely  be tried  yet did you not condescend to commit the arbitration to my  mother       true  and i thought her approbation would secure my peace of mind  but  how could i have expected mrs delvile s consent to such a scheme       she has merely accorded it from a certainty there is no other resource   believe me  therefore  my whole hope rests upon your present compliance   my father  i am certain  by his letter  will now hear neither petition  nor defence  on the contrary  he will only enrage at the temerity of  offering to confute him  but when he knows you are his daughter  his  honour will then be concerned in yours  and it will be as much his  desire to have it cleared  as it is now to have it censured       wait at least your return  and let us try what can be done with him       oh why   cried delvile  with much earnestness   must i linger out month  after month in this wretched uncertainty  if i wait i am undone  my  father  by the orders i must unavoidably leave  will discover the  preparations making without his consent  and he will work upon you in my  absence  and compel you to give me up       are you sure   said she  half smiling   he would have so much power       i am but too sure  that the least intimation  in his present irritable  state of mind  reaching him of my intentions  would make him not  scruple  in his fury  pronouncing some malediction upon my disobedience  that  neither  of us  i must own  could tranquilly disregard      this was an argument that came home to cecilia  whose deliberation upon  it  though silent  was evidently not unfavourable     he then told her that with respect to settlements  he would instantly  have a bond drawn up  similar to that prepared for their former intended  union  which should be properly signed and sealed  and by which he would  engage himself to make  upon coming to his estate  the same settlement  upon her that was made upon his mother      and as  instead of keeping up three houses   he continued   in the  manner my father does at present  i mean to put my whole estate  out to  nurse   while we reside for a while abroad  or in the country  i doubt  not but in a very few years we shall be as rich and as easy as we shall  desire      he told her  also  of his well founded expectations from the relations  already mentioned  which the concurrence of his mother with his marriage  would thence forward secure to him     he then  with more coherence  stated his plan at large  he purposed   without losing a moment  to return to london  he conjured her  in the  name of his mother  to set out herself early the next day  that the  following evening might be dedicated wholly to mrs delvile  through her  intercession he might then hope cecilia s compliance  and every thing on  the morning after should be prepared for their union  the long desired  ceremony over  he would instantly ride post to his father  and pay him   at least  the respect of being the first to communicate it  he would  then attend his mother to the continent  and leave the arrangement  of everything to his return   still  therefore  as a single man   he  continued   i mean to make the journey  and i shall take care  by the  time i return  to have all things in readiness for claiming my sweet  bride  tell me  then  now  if you can reasonably oppose this plan       indeed   said cecilia  after some hesitation   i cannot see the  necessity of such violent precipitancy       do you not try me too much   cried delvile  impatiently   to talk now  of precipitancy  after such painful waiting  such wearisome expectation   i ask you not to involve your own affairs in confusion by accompanying  me abroad  sweet to me as would be such an indulgence  i would not make  a run away of you in the opinion of the world  all i wish is the secret  certainty i cannot be robbed of you  that no cruel machinations may  again work our separation  that you are mine  unalterably mine  beyond  the power of caprice or ill fortune      cecilia made no answer  tortured with irresolution  she knew not upon  what to determine      we might then  according to the favour or displeasure of my father   settle wholly abroad for the present  or occasionally visit him in  england  my mother would be always and openly our friend  oh be firm   then  i conjure you  to the promise you have given her  and deign to be  mine on the conditions she prescribes  she will be bound to you for ever  by so generous a concession  and even her health may be restored by the  cessation of her anxieties  with such a wife  such a mother  what  will be wanting for  me   could i lament not being richer  i must be  rapacious indeed   speak  then  my cecilia  relieve me from the agony  of this eternal uncertainty  and tell me your word is invariable as your  honour  and tell me my mother gives not her sanction in vain      cecilia sighed deeply  but  after some hesitation  said   i little knew  what i had promised  nor know i now what to perform   there must ever  i  find  be some check to human happiness  yet  since upon these terms  mrs  delvile herself is content to wish me of her family       she stopt  but  urged earnestly by delvile  added  i must not  i think   withdraw the powers with which i entrusted her      delvile  grateful and enchanted  now forgot his haste and his business   and lost every wish but to re animate her spirits  she compelled him   however  to leave her  that his visit might less be wondered at  and  sent by him a message to mrs  delvile  that  wholly relying upon her  wisdom  she implicitly submitted to her decree         chapter xi     an enterprise     cecilia now had no time for afterthoughts or anxious repentance  since  notwithstanding the hurry of her spirits  and the confusion of her mind   she had too much real business  to yield to pensive indulgence     averse to all falsehood  she invented none upon this occasion  she  merely told her guests she was summoned to london upon an affair of  importance  and though she saw their curiosity  not being at liberty to  satisfy it with the truth  she attempted not to appease it by fiction   but quietly left it to its common fare  conjecture  she would gladly  have made henrietta the companion of her journey  but henrietta was the  last to whom that journey could give pleasure  she only  therefore  took  her maid in the chaise  and  attended by one servant on horseback  at  six o clock the next morning  she quitted her mansion  to enter into an  engagement by which soon she was to resign it for ever     disinterested as she was  she considered her situation as peculiarly  perverse  that from the time of her coming to a fortune which most  others regarded as enviable  she had been a stranger to peace  a  fruitless seeker of happiness  a dupe to the fraudulent  and a prey to  the needy  the little comfort she had received  had been merely from  dispensing it  and now only had she any chance of being happy herself   when upon the point of relinquishing what all others built their  happiness upon obtaining     these reflections only gave way to others still more disagreeable  she  was now a second time engaged in a transaction she could not approve   and suffering the whole peace of her future life to hang upon an action  dark  private and imprudent  an action by which the liberal kindness of  her late uncle would be annulled  by which the father of her intended  husband would be disobeyed  and which already  in a similar instance   had brought her to affliction and disgrace  these melancholy thoughts  haunted her during the whole journey  and though the assurance of  mrs delvile s approbation was some relief to her uneasiness  she  involuntarily prepared herself for meeting new mortifications  and was  tormented with an apprehension that this second attempt made her merit  them     she drove immediately  by the previous direction of delvile  to a  lodging house in albemarle street  which he had taken care to have  prepared for her reception  she then sent for a chair  and went to mrs  delvile s  her being seen by the servants of that house was not very  important  as their master was soon to be acquainted with the real  motive of her journey     she was shewn into a parlour  while mrs delvile was informed of her  arrival  and there flown to by delvile with the most grateful eagerness   yet she saw in his countenance that all was not well  and heard upon  enquiry that his mother was considerably worse  extremely shocked  by this intelligence  she already began to lament her unfortunate  enterprise  delvile struggled  by exerting his own spirits  to restore  hers  but forced gaiety is never exhilarating  and  full of care and  anxiety  he was ill able to appear sprightly and easy     they were soon summoned upstairs into the apartment of mrs delvile  who  was lying upon a couch  pale  weak  and much altered  delvile led the  way  saying   here  madam  comes one whose sight will bring peace and  pleasure to you       this  indeed   cried mrs delvile  half rising and embracing her   is  the form in which they are most welcome to me  virtuous  noble cecilia   what honour you do my son  with what joy  should i ever recover  shall i  assist him in paying the gratitude he owes you      cecilia  grieved at her situation  and affected by her kindness  could  only answer with her tears  which  however  were not shed alone  for  delvile s eyes were full  as he passionately exclaimed   this  this is  the sight my heart has thus long desired  the wife of my choice taken  to the bosom of the parent i revere  be yet but well  my beloved mother   and i will be thankful for every calamity that has led to so sweet a  conclusion       content yourself  however  my son  with one of us   cried mrs delvile   smiling   and content yourself  if you can  though your hard lot should  make that one this creature of full bloom  health  and youth  ah  my  love   added she  more seriously  and addressing the still weeping  cecilia   should now mortimer  in losing me  lose those cares by which  alone  for some months past  my life has been rendered tolerable  how  peaceably shall i resign him to one so able to recompense his filial  patience and services      this was not a speech to stop the tears of cecilia  though such warmth  of approbation quieted her conscientious scruples  delvile now earnestly  interfered  he told her that his mother had been ordered not to talk or  exert herself  and entreated her to be composed  and his mother to be  silent      be it  your  business  then   said mrs delvile  more gaily   to find  us entertainment  we will promise to be very still if you will take that  trouble upon yourself       i will not   answered he   be rallied from my purpose  if i cannot  entertain  it will be something to weary you  for that may incline you  to take rest  which will he answering a better purpose       mortimer   returned she   is this the ingenuity of duty or of love   and which are you just now thinking of  my health  or a conversation  uninterrupted with miss beverley       perhaps a little of both   said he  chearfully  though colouring      but you rather meant it should pass   said mrs delvile   you were  thinking only of me  i have always observed  that where one scheme  answers two purposes  the ostensive is never the purpose most at heart       why it is but common prudence   answered delvile   to feel our way a  little before we mention what we most wish  and so cast the hazard of  the refusal upon something rather less important       admirably settled   cried mrs delvile   so my rest is but to prove miss  beverley s disturbance   well  it is only anticipating our future way of  life  when her disturbance  in taking the management of you to herself   will of course prove my rest      she then quietly reposed herself  and delvile discoursed with cecilia  upon their future plans  hopes and actions     he meant to set off from the church door to delvile castle  to acquaint  his father with his marriage  and then to return instantly to london   there he entreated cecilia to stay with his mother  that  finding them  both together  he might not exhaust her patience  by making his parting  visit occasion another journey to suffolk     but here cecilia resolutely opposed him  saying  her only chance to  escape discovery  was going instantly to her own house  and representing  so earnestly her desire that their marriage should be unknown till his  return to england  upon a thousand motives of delicacy  propriety  and  fearfulness  that the obligation he owed already to a compliance which  he saw grew more and more reluctant  restrained him both in gratitude  and pity from persecuting her further  neither would she consent to  seeing him in suffolk  which could but delay his mother s journey  and  expose her to unnecessary suspicions  she promised  however  to write  to him often  and as  from his mother s weakness  he must travel very  slowly  she took a plan of his route  and engaged that he should find a  letter from her at every great town     the bond which he had already had altered  he insisted upon leaving in  her own custody  averse to applying to mr monckton  whose behaviour to  him had before given him disgust  and in whom cecilia herself no  longer wished to confide  he had again applied to the same lawyer  mr  singleton  to give her away  for though to his secrecy he had no tie  he  had still less to any entire stranger  mrs delvile was too ill to attend  them to church  nor would delvile have desired from her such absolute  defiance of his father     cecilia now gave another sigh to her departed friend mrs charlton  whose  presence upon this awful occasion would else again have soothed and  supported her  she had no female friend in whom she could rely  but  feeling a repugnance invincible to being accompanied only by men  she  accepted the attendance of mrs delvile s own woman  who had lived many  years in the family  and was high in the favour and confidence of her  lady     the arrangement of these and other articles  with occasional  interruptions from mrs delvile  fully employed the evening  delvile  would not trust again to meeting her at the church  but begged her to  send out her servants between seven and eight o clock in the morning  at  which time he would himself call for her with a chair     she went away early  that mrs delvile might go to rest  and it was  mutually agreed they should risk no meeting the next day  delvile  conjured them to part with firmness and chearfulness  and cecilia   fearing her own emotion  would have retired without bidding her adieu   but mrs delvile  calling after her  said   take with you my blessing    and tenderly embracing her  added   my son  as my chief nurse  claims  a prescriptive right to govern me  but i will break from his control to  tell my sweet cecilia what ease and what delight she has already given  to my mind  my best hope of recovery is founded on the pleasure i  anticipate to witnessing your mutual happiness  but should my illness  prove fatal  and that felicity be denied me  my greatest earthly care is  already removed by the security i feel of mortimer s future peace  take  with you  then  my blessing  for you are become one to me  long daughter  of my affection  now wife of my darling son  love her  mortimer  as  she merits  and cherish her with tenderest gratitude   banish  sweetest  cecilia  every apprehension that oppresses you  and receive in mortimer  delvile a husband that will revere your virtues  and dignify your  choice      she then embraced her again  and seeing that her heart was too full for  speech  suffered her to go without making any answer  delvile attended  her to her chair  scarce less moved than herself  and found only  opportunity to entreat her punctuality the next morning     she had  indeed  no inclination to fail in her appointment  or risk  the repetition of scenes so affecting  or situations so alarming  mrs  delvile s full approbation somewhat restored to her her own  but nothing  could remove the fearful anxiety  which still privately tormented her  with expectations of another disappointment     the next morning she arose with the light  and calling all her courage  to her aid  determined to consider this day as decisive of her destiny  with regard to delvile  and  rejoicing that at least all suspense would  be over  to support herself with fortitude  be that destiny what it  might     at the appointed time she sent her maid to visit mrs hill  and gave some  errands to her man that carried him to a distant part of the town  but  she charged them both to return to the lodgings by nine o clock  at  which hour she ordered a chaise for returning into the country     delvile  who was impatiently watching for their quitting the house  only  waited till they were out of sight  to present himself at the door  he  was shewn into a parlour  where she instantly attended him  and being  told that the clergyman  mr singleton  and mrs delvile s woman  were  already in the church  she gave him her hand in silence  and he led her  to the chair     the calmness of stifled hope had now taken place in cecilia of quick  sensations and alarm  occupied with a firm belief she should never be  the wife of delvile  she only waited  with a desperate sort of patience   to see when and by whom she was next to be parted from him     when they arrived near the church  delvile stopt the chair  he handed  cecilia out of it  and discharging the chairmen  conducted her into the  church  he was surprised himself at her composure  but earnestly wishing  it to last  took care not to say to her a word that should make any  answer from her necessary     he gave her  as before  to mr singleton  secretly praying that not  as  before  she might be given him in vain  mrs delvile s woman attended  her  the clergyman was ready  and they all proceeded to the altar     the ceremony was begun  cecilia  rather mechanically than with  consciousness  appearing to listen to it but at the words   if any man  can shew any just cause why they may not lawfully be joined together    delvile himself shook with terror  lest some concealed person should  again answer it  and cecilia  with a sort of steady dismay in her  countenance  cast her eyes round the church  with no other view than  that of seeing from what corner the prohibiter would start     she looked  however  to no purpose  no prohibiter appeared  the ceremony  was performed without any interruption  and she received the thanks  of delvile  and the congratulations of the little set  before the idea  which had so strongly pre occupied her imagination  was sufficiently  removed from it to satisfy her she was really married     they then went to the vestry  where their business was not long  and  delvile again put cecilia into a chair  which again he accompanied on  foot     her sensibility now soon returned  though still attended with  strangeness and a sensation of incredulity  but the sight of delvile at  her lodgings  contrary to their agreement  wholly recovered her  senses from the stupor which had dulled them  he came  however  but to  acknowledge how highly she had obliged him  to see her himself restored  to the animation natural to her  character  and to give her a million  of charges  resulting from anxiety and tenderness  and then  fearing the  return of her servants  he quitted her  and set out for delvile castle     the amazement of cecilia was still unconquerable  to be actually united  with delvile  to be his with the full consent of his mother   to have  him her s  beyond the power of his father   she could not reconcile it  with possibility  she fancied it a dream   but a dream from which she  wished not to wake         book x         chapter i    a discovery     cecilia s journey back to the country was as safe and free from  interruption as her journey had been to town  and all that distinguished  them was what passed in her own mind  the doubts  apprehensions  and  desponding suspense which had accompanied her setting out  were now  all removed  and certainty  ease  the expectation of happiness  and the  cessation of all perplexity  had taken their place  she had nothing left  to dread but the inflexibility of mr delvile  and hardly any thing even  to hope but the recovery of his lady     her friends at her return expressed their wonder at her expedition   but their wonder at what occasioned it  though still greater  met no  satisfaction  henrietta rejoiced in her sight  though her absence had  been so short  and cecilia  whose affection with her pity increased   intimated to her the event for which she wished her to prepare herself   and frankly acknowledged she had reason to expect it would soon take  place     henrietta endeavoured with composure to receive this intelligence  and  to return such a mark of confidence with chearful congratulations  but  her fortitude was unequal to an effort so heroic  and her character was  too simple to assume a greatness she felt not  she sighed and changed  colour  and hastily quitted the room that she might sob aloud in  another     warm hearted  tender  and susceptible  her affections were all  undisguised  struck with the elegance of delvile  and enchanted by his  services to her brother  she had lost to him her heart at first without  missing it  and  when missed  without seeking to reclaim it  the  hopelessness of such a passion she never considered  nor asked herself  its end  or scarce suspected its aim  it was pleasant to her at the  time  and she looked not to the future  but fed it with visionary  schemes  and soothed it with voluntary fancies  now she knew all was  over  she felt the folly she had committed  but though sensibly and  candidly angry at her own error  its conviction offered nothing but  sorrow to succeed it     the felicity of cecilia  whom she loved  admired and revered  she wished  with the genuine ardour of zealous sincerity  but that delvile  the very  cause and sole subject of her own personal unhappiness  should himself  constitute that felicity  was too much for her spirits  and seemed to  her mortified mind too cruel in her destiny     cecilia  who in the very vehemence of her sorrow saw its innocence   was too just and too noble to be offended by it  or impute to the bad  passions of envy or jealousy  the artless regret of an untutored mind   to be penetrated too deeply with the merit of delvile  with her wanted  no excuse  and she grieved for her situation with but little mixture  of blame  and none of surprise  she redoubled her kindness and caresses  with the hope of consoling her  but ventured to trust her no further   till reflection  and her natural good sense  should better enable her to  bear an explanation     nor was this friendly exertion any longer a hardship to her  the sudden  removal  in her own feelings and affairs  of distress and expectation   had now so much lightened her heart  that she could spare without  repining  some portion of its spirit to her dejected young friend     but an incident happened two mornings after which called back  and most  unpleasantly  her attention to herself  she was told that mrs matt  the  poor woman she had settled in bury  begged an audience  and upon sending  for her up stairs  and desiring to know what she could do for her    nothing  madam  just now   she answered   for i don t come upon my own  business  but to tell some news to you  madam  you bid me never take  notice of the wedding  that was to be  and i m sure i never opened my  mouth about it from that time to this  but i have found out who it was  put a stop to it  and so i come to tell you      cecilia  extremely amazed  eagerly desired her to go on      why  madam  i don t know the gentlewoman s name quite right yet  but  i can tell you where she lives  for i knew her as soon as i set eyes on  her  when i see her at church last sunday  and i would have followed her  home  but she went into a coach  and i could not walk fast enough  but i  asked one of the footmen where she lived  and he said at the great house  at the grove  and perhaps  madam  you may know where that is  and then  he told me her name  but that i can t just now think of       good heaven   cried cecilia    it could not be bennet       yes  ma am  that s the very name  i know it again now i hear it      cecilia then hastily dismissed her  first desiring her not to mention  the circumstance to any body     shocked and dismayed  she now saw  but saw with horror  the removal of  all her doubts  and the explanation of all her difficulties  in the  full and irrefragable discovery of the perfidy of her oldest friend and  confident     miss bennet herself she regarded in the affair as a mere tool  which   though in effect it did the work  was innocent of its mischief  because  powerless but in the hand of its employer      that employer   cried she   must be mr monckton  mr monckton whom so  long i have known  who so willingly has been my counsellor  so ably my  instructor  in whose integrity i have confided  upon whose friendship  i have relied  my succour in all emergencies  my guide in all  perplexities   mr  monckton  thus dishonourably  thus barbarously to  betray me  to turn against me the very confidence i had reposed in his  regard for me  and make use of my own trust to furnish the means to  injure me        she was now wholly confirmed that he had wronged her with mr delvile   she could not have two enemies so malignant without provocation  and he  who so unfeelingly could dissolve a union at the very altar  could alone  have the baseness to calumniate her so cruelly     evil thoughts thus awakened  stopt not merely upon facts  conjecture  carried her further  and conjecture built upon probability  the  officiousness of morrice in pursuing her to london  his visiting her  when there  and his following and watching delvile  she now reasonably  concluded were actions directed by mr monckton  whose house he had but  just left  and whose orders  whatever they might be  she was almost  certain he would obey  availing himself  therefore  of the forwardness  and suppleness which met in this young man  she doubted not but his  intelligence had contributed to acquaint him with her proceedings     the motive of such deep concerted and accumulated treachery was next to  be sought  nor was the search long  one only could have tempted him to  schemes so hazardous and costly  and  unsuspicious as she was  she now  saw into his whole design     long accustomed to regard him as a safe and disinterested old friend   the respect with which  as a child  she had looked up to him  she  had insensibly preserved when a woman  that respect had taught her to  consider his notice as a favour  and far from suspiciously shunning  she  had innocently courted it  and his readiness in advising and tutoring  her  his frank and easy friendliness of behaviour  had kept his  influence unimpaired  by preventing its secret purpose from being  detected     but now the whole mystery was revealed  his aversion to the delviles  to  which hitherto she had attributed all she disapproved in his behaviour   she was convinced must be inadequate to stimulate him to such lengths   that aversion itself was by this late surmise accounted for  and no  sooner did it occur to her  than a thousand circumstances confirmed it     the first among these was the evident ill will of lady margaret  which  though she had constantly imputed to the general irascibility for which  her character was notorious  she had often wondered to find impenetrable  to all endeavours to please or soften her  his care of her fortune  his  exhortations against her expences  his wish to make her live with mr  briggs  all contributed to point out the selfishness of his attentions   which in one instance rendered visible  became obvious in every other     yet various as were the incidents that now poured upon her memory to  his disgrace  not one among them took its rise from his behaviour to  herself  which always had been scrupulously circumspect  or if for a  moment unguarded  only at a season when her own distress or confusion  had prevented her from perceiving it  this recollection almost staggered  her suspicions  yet so absolute seemed the confirmation they received  from every other  that her doubt was overpowered  and soon wholly  extinguished     she was yet ruminating on this subject  when  word was brought her that  mr monckton was in the parlour     mingled disgust and indignation made her shudder at his name  and  without pausing a moment  she sent him word she was engaged  and could  not possibly leave her room     astonished by such a dismission  he left the house in the utmost  confusion  but cecilia could not endure to see him  after a discovery of  such hypocrisy and villainy     she considered  however  that the matter could not rest here  he would  demand an explanation  and perhaps  by his unparalleled address  again  contrive to seem innocent  notwithstanding appearances were at present  so much against him  expecting  therefore  some artifice  and determined  not to be duped by it  she sent again for the pew opener  to examine her  more strictly     the woman was out at work in a private family  and could not come till  the evening  but  when further questioned  the description she gave of  miss bennet was too exact to be disputed     she then desired her to call again the next morning and sent a servant  to the grove  with her compliments to miss bennet  and a request that  she might send her carriage for her the next day  at any time she  pleased  as she wished much to speak with her     this message  she was aware  might create some suspicion  and put her  upon her guard  but she thought  nevertheless  a sudden meeting with the  pew opener  whom she meant abruptly to confront with her  would baffle  the security of any previously settled scheme     to a conviction such as this even mr monckton must submit  and since he  was lost to her as a friend  she might at least save herself the pain of  keeping up his acquaintance         chapter ii     an interview     the servant did not return till it was dark  and then  with a look of  much dismay  said he had been able to meet with nobody who could either  give or take a message  that the grove was all in confusion  and the  whole country in an uproar  for mr monckton  just as he arrived  had  been brought home dead     cecilia screamed with involuntary horror  a pang like remorse seized her  mind  with the apprehension she had some share in this catastrophe   and innocent as she was either of his fall or his crimes  she no  sooner heard he was no more  than she forgot he had offended her  and  reproached herself with severity for the shame to which she meant to  expose him the next morning     dreadfully disturbed by this horrible incident  she entreated mrs  harrel and henrietta to sup by themselves  and going into her own room   determined to write the whole affair to delvile  in a letter she should  direct to be left at the post office for him at margate     and here strongly she felt the happiness of being actually his wife  she  could now without reserve make him acquainted with all her affairs  and  tell to the master of her heart every emotion that entered it     while engaged in this office  the very action of which quieted her   a letter was brought her from delvile himself  she received it with  gratitude and opened it with joy  he had promised to write soon  but so  soon she had thought impossible     the reading took not much time  the letter contained but the following  words      to miss beverley      my cecilia   be alone  i conjure you  dismiss every body  and admit me  this moment     great was her astonishment at this note  no name to it  no conclusion   the characters indistinct  the writing crooked  the words so few  and  those few scarce legible     he desired to see her  and to see her alone  she could not hesitate in  her compliance   but whom could she dismiss   her servants  if ordered  away  would but be curiously upon the watch   she could think of no  expedient  she was all hurry and amazement     she asked if any one waited for an answer  the footman said no  that  the note was given in by somebody who did not speak  and who ran out of  sight the moment he had delivered it     she could not doubt this was delvile himself   delvile who should now  be just returned from the castle to his mother  and whom she had thought  not even a letter would reach if directed any where nearer than margate     all she could devise in obedience to him  was to go and wait for him  alone in her dressing room  giving orders that if any one called they  might be immediately brought up to her  as she expected somebody upon  business  with whom she must not be interrupted     this was extremely disagreeable to her  yet  contrary as it was to their  agreement  she felt no inclination to reproach delvile  the abruptness  of his note  the evident hand shaking with which it had been written   the strangeness of the request in a situation such as theirs   all  concurred to assure her he came not to her idly  and all led her to  apprehend he came to her with evil tidings     what they might be  she had no time to conjecture  a servant  in a few  minutes  opened the dressing room door  and said   ma am  a gentleman    and delvile  abruptly entering  shut it himself  in his eagerness to get  rid of him     at his sight  her prognostication of ill became stronger  she went  forward to meet him  and he advanced to her smiling and in haste   but that smile did not well do its office  it concealed not a pallid  countenance  in which every feature spoke horror  it disguised not an  aching heart  which almost visibly throbbed with intolerable emotion   yet he addressed her in terms of tenderness and peace  but his tremulous  voice counteracted his words  and spoke that all within was tumult and  war     cecilia  amazed  affrighted  had no power to hasten an explanation   which  on his own part  he seemed unable  or fearful to begin  he talked  to her of his happiness in again seeing her before he left the kingdom   entreated her to write to him continually  said the same thing two and  three times in a breath  began with one subject  and seemed unconscious  he wandered presently into another  and asked her questions innumerable  about her health  journey  affairs  and ease of mind  without hearing  from her any answer  or seeming to miss that she had none     cecilia grew dreadfully terrified  something strange and most alarming  she was sure must have happened  but  what   she had no means to know   nor courage  nor even words to enquire     delvile  at length  the first hurry of his spirits abating  became more  coherent and considerate  and looking anxiously at her  said   why this  silence  my cecilia       i know not   said she  endeavouring to recover herself   but your  coming was unexpected  i was just writing to you at margate       write still  then  but direct to ostend  i shall be quicker than the  post  and i would not lose a letter  a line  a word from you  for all  the world can offer me       quicker than the post   cried cecilia   but how can mrs delvile    she  stopt  not knowing what she might venture to ask      she is now on the road to margate  i hope to be there to receive her  i  mean but to bid you adieu  and be gone      cecilia made no answer  she was more and more astonished  more and more  confounded      you are thoughtful   said he  with tenderness   are you  unhappy   sweetest cecilia  most excellent of human creatures  if i have  made you unhappy  and i must   it is inevitable         oh delvile   cried she  now assuming more courage   why will you not  speak to me openly   something  i see  is wrong  may i not hear it  may  i not tell you  at least  my concern that any thing has distressed you       you are too good   cried he   to deserve you is not possible  but to  afflict you is inhuman       why so   cried she  more chearfully   must i not share the common lot   or expect the whole world to be new modelled  lest i should meet in it  any thing but happiness       there is not  indeed  much danger  have you pen and ink here      she brought them to him immediately  with paper      you have been writing to me  you say   i will begin a letter myself       to me   cried she     he made no answer  but took up the pen  and wrote a few words  and then   flinging it down  said   fool   i could have done this without coming       may i look at it   said she  and  finding he made no opposition   advanced and read      i fear to alarm you by rash precipitation   i fear to alarm you by  lingering suspense   but all is not well        fear nothing   cried she  turning to him with the kindest earnestness    tell me  whatever it may be   am i not your wife  bound by every tie  divine and human to share in all your sorrows  if  unhappily  i cannot  mitigate them       since you allow me   cried he  gratefully   so sweet a claim  a claim  to which all others yield  and which if you repent not giving me  will  make all others nearly immaterial to me   i will own to you that all   indeed  is not well  i have been hasty   you will blame me  i deserve   indeed  to be blamed   entrusted with your peace and happiness  to  suffer rage  resentment  violence  to make me forego what i owed to such  a deposite   if your blame  however  stops short of repentance  but it  cannot       what  then   cried she with warmth   must you have done  for there  is not an action of which i believe you capable  there is not an event  which i believe to be possible  that can ever make me repent belonging  to you wholly       generous  condescending cecilia   cried he   words such as these  hung  there not upon me an evil the most depressing  would be almost more than  i could bear  would make me too blest for mortality       but words such as these   said she more gaily   i might long have  coquetted ere i had spoken  had you not drawn them from me by this  alarm  take  therefore  the good with the ill  and remember  if all does  not go right  you have now a trusty friend  as willing to be the partner  of your serious as your happiest hours       shew but as much firmness as you have shewn sweetness   cried he   and  i will fear to tell you nothing      she reiterated her assurances  they then both sat down  and he began his  account      immediately from your lodgings i went where i had ordered a chaise  and  stopped only to change horses till i reached delvile castle  my father  saw me with surprise  and received me with coldness  i was compelled by  my situation to be abrupt  and told him i came  before i accompanied  my mother abroad  to make him acquainted with an affair which i thought  myself bound in duty and respect to suffer no one to communicate to him  but myself  he then sternly interrupted me  and declared in high terms   that if this affair concerned  you   he would not listen to it  i  attempted to remonstrate upon this injustice  when he passionately broke  forth into new and horrible charges against you  affirming that he had  them from authority as indisputable as ocular demonstration  i was then  certain of some foul play         foul play indeed   cried cecilia  who now knew but too well by whom she  had been injured   good heaven  how have i been deceived  where most i  have trusted       i told him   continued delvile   some gross imposition had been  practiced upon him  and earnestly conjured him no longer to conceal  from me by whom  this  unfortunately  encreased his rage  imposition   he said  was not so easily played upon him  he left that for  me  who so  readily was duped  while for himself  he had only given credit to a man  of much consideration in suffolk  who had known you from a child  who  had solemnly assured him he had repeatedly endeavoured to reclaim you   who had rescued you from the hands of jews at his own hazard and loss   and who actually shewed him bonds acknowledging immense debts  which  were signed with your own hand       horrible   exclaimed cecilia   i believed not such guilt and perfidy  possible       i was scarce myself   resumed delvile   while i heard him  i demanded  even with fierceness his author  whom i scrupled not to execrate as he  deserved  he coldly answered he was bound by an oath never to reveal  him  nor should he repay his honourable attention to his family by a  breach of his own word  were it even less formally engaged  i then  lost all patience  to mention honour  i cried  was a farce  where  such infamous calumnies were listened to   but let me not shock you  unnecessarily  you may readily conjecture what passed       ah me   cried cecilia   you have then quarrelled with your father       i have   said he   nor does he yet know i am married  in so much wrath  there was no room for narration  i only pledged myself by all i held  sacred  never to rest till i had cleared your fame  by the detection of  this villainy  and then left him without further explanation       oh return  then  to him directly   cried cecilia   he is your father   you are bound to bear with his displeasure   alas  had you never known  me  you had never incurred it       believe me   he answered   i am ill at ease under it  if you wish it   when you have heard me  i will go to him immediately  if not  i will  write  and you shall yourself dictate what      cecilia thanked him  and begged he would continue his account      my first step  when i left the castle  was to send a letter to my  mother  in which i entreated her to set out as soon as possible for  margate  as i was detained from her unavoidably  and was unwilling my  delay should either retard our journey  or oblige her to travel faster   at margate i hoped to be as soon as herself  if not before her       and why   cried cecilia   did you not go to town as you had promised   and accompany her       i had business another way  i came hither       directly       no  but soon       where did you go first       my cecilia  it is now you must summon your fortitude  i left my  father without an explanation on my part   but not till  in his rage of  asserting his authority  he had unwarily named his informant       well       that informant  the most deceitful of men   was your long pretended  friend  mr monckton       so i feared   said cecilia  whose blood now ran cold through her veins  with sudden and new apprehensions      i rode to the grove  on hack horses  and on a full gallop the whole  way  i got to him early in the evening  i was shewn into his library  i  told him my errand   you look pale  my love  you are not well        cecilia  too sick for speech  leant her head upon a table  delvile was  going to call for help  but she put her hand upon his arm to stop  him  and  perceiving she was only mentally affected  he rested  and  endeavoured by every possible means to revive her     after a while  she again raised her head  faintly saying   i am sorry  i interrupted you  but the conclusion i already know   mr monckton is  dead       not dead   cried he   dangerously  indeed  wounded  but thank heaven   not actually dead       not dead   cried cecilia  with recruited strength and spirits   oh then  all yet may be well   if he is not dead  he may recover       he may  i hope he will       now  then   she cried   tell me all  i can bear any intelligence but of  death by human means       i meant not to have gone such lengths  far from it  i hold duels in  abhorrence  as unjustifiable acts of violence  and savage devices of  revenge  i have offended against my own conviction   but  transported  with passion at his infamous charges  i was not master of my reason  i  accused hum of his perfidy  he denied it  i told him i had it from my  father   he changed the subject to pour abuse upon him  i insisted on a  recantation to clear you  he asked by what right  i fiercely answered   by a husband s  his countenance  then  explained at least the motives  of his treachery   he loves you himself  he had probably schemed to keep  you free till his wife died  and then concluded his machinations would  secure you his own  for this purpose  finding he was in danger of losing  you  he was content even to blast your character  rather than suffer you  to escape him  but the moment i acknowledged my marriage he grew more  furious than myself  and  in short for why relate the frenzies of rage   we walked out together  my travelling pistols were already charged   i gave him his choice of them  and  the challenge being mine  for  insolence joined with guilt had robbed me of all forbearance  he fired  first  but missed me  i then demanded whether he would clear your  fame  he called out  fire  i will make no terms    i did fire   and  unfortunately aimed better  we had neither of us any second  all was the  result of immediate passion  but i soon got people to him  and assisted  in conveying him home  he was at  first believed to be dead  and i was  seized by his servants  but he afterwards shewed signs of life  and by  sending for my friend biddulph  i was released  such is the melancholy  transaction i came to relate to you  flattering myself it would  something less shock you from me than from another  yet my own real  concern for the affair  the repentance with which from the moment the  wretch fell  i was struck in being his destroyer  and the sorrow  the  remorse  rather  which i felt  in coming to wound you with such  black  such fearful intelligence   you to whom all i owe is peace and  comfort   these thoughts gave me so much disturbance  that  in fact  i  knew less than any other how to prepare you for such a tale      he stopt  but cecilia could say nothing  to censure him now would both  be cruel and vain  yet to pretend she was satisfied with his conduct   would be doing violence to her judgment and veracity  she saw  too  that  his error had sprung wholly from a generous ardor in her defence  and  that his confidence in her character  had resisted  without wavering   every attack that menaced it  for this she felt truly grateful  yet  his quarrel with his father   the danger of his mother   his necessary  absence   her own clandestine situation   and more than all  the  threatened death of mr monckton by his hands  were circumstances so full  of dread and sadness  she knew not upon which to speak   how to offer  him comfort   how to assume a countenance that looked able to receive  any  or by what means to repress the emotions which to many ways  assailed her  delvile  having vainly waited some reply  then in a  tone the most melancholy  said   if it is yet possible you can be  sufficiently interested in my fate to care what becomes of me  aid me  now with your counsel  or rather with your instructions  i am scarce  able to think for myself  and to be thought for by you  would yet be a  consolation that would give me spirit for any thing      cecilia  starting from her reverie  repeated   to care what becomes of  you   oh delvile   make not my heart bleed by words of such unkindness       forgive me   cried he   i meant not a reproach  i meant but to state  my own consciousness how little i deserve from you  you talked to me of  going to my father  do you still wish it       i think so   cried she  too much disturbed to know what she said  yet  fearing again to hurt him by making him wait her answer      i will go then   said he   without doubt  too happy to be guided by  you  which ever way i steer  i have now  indeed much to tell him  but  whatever may be his wrath  there is little fear  at this time  that my  own temper cannot bear it  what next shall i do       what next   repeated she   indeed i know not       shall i go immediately to margate  or shall i first ride hither       if you please   said she  much perturbed  and deeply sighing      i please nothing but by your direction  to follow that is my only  chance of pleasure  which  then  shall i do  you will not  now  refuse  to direct me       no  certainly  not for the world       speak to me  then  my love  and tell me   why are you thus silent   is  it painful to you to counsel me       no  indeed   said she  putting her hand to her head   i will speak to  you in a few minutes       oh my cecilia   cried he  looking at her with much alarm   call back  your recollection  you know not what you say  you take no interest in  what you answer       indeed i do   said she  sighing deeply  and oppressed beyond the  power of thinking  beyond any power but an internal consciousness of  wretchedness      sigh not so bitterly   cried he   if you have any compassion  sigh not  so bitterly   i cannot bear to hear you       i am very sorry indeed   said she  sighing again  and not seeming  sensible she spoke      good heaven   cried he  rising   distract me not with this  horror   speak not to me in such broken sentences   do you hear me   cecilia   why will you not answer me      she started and trembled  looked pale and affrighted  and putting both  her hands upon her heart  said   oh yes   but i have an oppression  here   a tightness  a fulness   i have not room for breath       oh beloved of my heart   cried he  wildly casting himself at her feet    kill me not with this terror   call back your faculties   awake from  this dreadful insensibility  tell me at least you know me   tell me i  have not tortured you quite to madness   sole darling of my affections   my own  my wedded cecilia   rescue me from this agony  it is more than i  can support         this energy of distress brought back her scattered senses  scarce more  stunned by the shock of all this misery  than by the restraint of her  feelings in struggling to conceal it  but these passionate exclamations  restoring her sensibility  she burst into tears  which happily relieved  her mind from the conflict with which it was labouring  and which  not  thus effected  might have ended more fatally     never had delvile more rejoiced in her smiles than now in these  seasonable tears  which he regarded and blest as the preservers of her  reason  they flowed long without any intermission  his soothing and  tenderness but melting her to more sorrow  after a while  however  the  return of her faculties  which at first seemed all consigned over to  grief  was manifested by the returning strength of her mind  she blamed  herself severely for the little fortitude she had shewn  but having now  given vent to emotions too forcible to be wholly stiffed  she assured  him he might depend upon her  better courage for the future  and  entreated him to consider and settle his affairs     not speedily  however  could delvile himself recover  the torture he had  suffered in believing  though only for a few moments  that the terror  he had given to cecilia had affected her intellects  made even a deeper  impression upon his imagination  than the scene of fury and death  which  had occasioned that terror  and cecilia  who now strained every nerve  to repair by her firmness  the pain which by her weakness she had given  him  was sooner in a condition for reasoning and deliberation than  himself      ah delvile   she cried  comprehending what passed within him   do  you allow nothing for surprize  and nothing for the hard conflict of  endeavouring to suppress it  do you think me still as unfit to advise  with  and as worthless  as feeble a counsellor  as during the first  confusion of my mind       hurry not your tender spirits  i beseech you   cried he   we have time  enough  we will talk about business by and by       what time   cried she   what is it now o clock       good heaven   cried he  looking at his watch   already past ten  you  must turn me out  my cecilia  or calumny will still be busy  even though  poor monckton is quiet       i  will  turn you out   cried she   i am indeed most earnest to have  you gone  but tell me your plan  and which way you mean to go       that   he answered   you shall decide for me yourself  whether to  delvile castle  to finish one tale  and wholly communicate another  or  to margate  to hasten my mother abroad  before the news of this calamity  reaches her       go to margate   cried she  eagerly   set off this very moment  you can  write to your father from ostend  but continue  i conjure you  on the  continent  till we see if this unhappy man lives  and enquire  of those  who can judge  what must follow if he should not       a trial   said he   must follow  and it will go  i fear  but hardly  with me  the challenge was mine  his servants can all witness i went  to him  not he to me   oh my cecilia  the rashness of which i have been  guilty  is so opposite to my principles  and  all generous as is your  silence  i know it so opposite to yours  that never  should his blood be  on my hands  wretch as he was  never will my heart be quiet more       he will live  he will live   cried cecilia  repressing her horror    fear nothing  for he will live   and as to his wound and his  sufferings  his perfidy has deserved them  go  then  to margate  think  only of mrs delvile  and save her  if possible  from hearing what has  happened       i will go   stay   do which and whatever you bid me  but  should what i  fear come to pass  should my mother continue ill  my father inflexible   should this wretched man die  and should england no longer be a country  i shall love to dwell in   could you  then  bear to own   would you   then  consent to follow me       could i   am i not yours  may you not command me  tell me  then  you  have only to say   shall i accompany you at once      delvile  affected by her generosity  could scarce utter his thanks  yet  he did not hesitate in denying to avail himself of it   no  my cecilia    he cried   i am not so selfish  if we have not happier days  we will at  least wait for more desperate necessity  with the uncertainty if i have  not this man s life to answer for at the hazard of my own  to take my  wife  my bride   from the kingdom i must fly   to make her a fugitive  and an exile in the first publishing that she is mine  no  if i am not a  destined alien for life i can never permit it  nothing less  believe  me  shall ever urge my consent to wound the chaste propriety of your  character  by making you an eloper with a duelist      they then again consulted upon their future plans  and concluded that in  the present disordered state of their affairs  it would be best not to  acknowledge even to mr delvile their marriage  to whom the news of the  duel  and mr monckton s danger  would be a blow so severe  that  to add  to it any other might half distract him     to the few people already acquainted with it  delvile therefore  determined to write from ostend  re urging his entreaties for their  discretion and secrecy  cecilia promised every post to acquaint him how  mr monckton went on  and she then besought him to go instantly  that he  might out travel the ill news to his mother     he complied  and took leave of her in the tenderest manner  conjuring  her to support her spirits  and be careful of her health   happiness    said he   is much in arrears with us  and though my violence may have  frightened it away  your sweetness and gentleness will yet attract it  back  all that for me is in store must be received at your hands   what  is offered in any other way  i shall only mistake for evil  droop not   therefore  my generous cecilia  but in yourself preserve me       i will not droop   said she   you will find  i hope  you have not  intrusted yourself in ill hands       peace then be with you  my love   my comforting  my soul reviving  cecilia  peace  such as angels give  and such as may drive from your  mind the remembrance of this bitter hour      he then tore himself away     cecilia  who to his blessings could almost  like the tender belvidera   have exclaimed                 o do not leave me   stay with me and curse me      listened to his steps till she could hear them no longer  as if the  remaining moments of her life were to be measured by them  but then   remembering the danger both to herself and him of his stay  she  endeavoured to rejoice that he was gone  and  but that her mind was in  no state for joy  was too rational not to have succeeded     grief and horror for what was past  apprehension and suspense for  what was to come  so disordered her whole frame  so confused even her  intellects  that when not all the assistance of fancy could persuade  her she still heard the footsteps of delvile  she went to the chair upon  which he had been seated  and taking possession of it  sat with her arms  crossed  silent  quiet  and erect  almost vacant of all thought  yet  with a secret idea she was doing something right     here she continued till henrietta came to wish her good night  whose  surprise and concern at the strangeness of her look and attitude  once  more recovered her  but terrified herself at this threatened wandering  of her reason  and certain she must all night be a stranger to rest  she  accepted the affectionate offer of the kind hearted girl to stay with  her  who was too much grieved for her grief to sleep any more than  herself     she told her not what had passed  that  she knew  would be fruitless  affliction to her  but she was soothed by her gentleness  and her  conversation was some security from the dangerous rambling of her ideas     henrietta herself found no little consolation in her own private  sorrows  that she was able to give comfort to her beloved miss beverley   from whom she had received favours and kind offices innumerable  she  quitted her not night nor day  and in the honest pride of a little  power to skew the gratefulness of her heart  she felt a pleasure and  self consequence she had never before experienced         chapter iii     a summons     cecilia s earliest care  almost at break of day  was to send to the  grove  from thence she heard nothing but evil  mr monckton was still  alive  but with little or no hope of recovery  constantly delirious  and  talking of miss beverley  and of her being married to young delvile     cecilia  who knew well this  at least  was no delirium  though shocked  that he talked of it  hoped his danger less than was apprehended     the next day  however  more fatal news was brought her  though not from  the quarter she expected it  mr monckton  in one of his raving fits  had  sent for lady margaret to his bed side  and used her almost inhumanly   he had railed at her age and her infirmities with incredible fury   called her the cause of all his sufferings  and accused her as the  immediate agent of lucifer in his present wound and danger  lady  margaret  whom neither jealousy nor malignity had cured of loving him   was dismayed and affrighted  and in hurrying out of the room upon his  attempting  in his frenzy  to strike her  she dropt down dead in an  apoplectic fit      good heaven   thought cecilia   what an exemplary punishment has this  man  he loses his hated wife at the very moment when her death could  no longer answer his purposes  poor lady margaret  her life has been as  bitter as her temper  married from a view of interest  ill used as a bar  to happiness  and destroyed from the fruitless ravings of despair      she wrote all this intelligence to ostend  whence she received a letter  from delvile  acquainting her he was detained from proceeding further  by the weakness and illness of his mother  whose sufferings from  seasickness had almost put an end to her existence     thus passed a miserable week  monckton still merely alive  delvile  detained at ostend  and cecilia tortured alike by what was recently  passed  actually present  and fearfully expected  when one morning she  was told a gentleman upon business desired immediately to speak with  her     she hastily obeyed the summons  the constant image of her own mind   delvile  being already present to her  and a thousand wild conjectures  upon what had brought him back  rapidly occurring to her     her expectations  however  were ill answered  for she found an entire  stranger  an elderly man  of no pleasant aspect or manners     she desired to know his business      i presume  madam  you are the lady of this house      she bowed an assent      may i take the liberty  madam  to ask your name       my name  sir       you will do me a favour  madam  by telling it me       is it possible you are come hither without already knowing it       i know it only by common report  madam       common report  sir  i believe is seldom wrong in a matter where to be  right is so easy       have you any objection  madam  to telling me your name       no  sir  but your business can hardly be very important  if you are yet  to learn whom you are to address  it will be time enough  therefore  for  us to meet when you are elsewhere satisfied in this point      she would then have left the room      i beg  madam   cried the stranger   you will have patience  it is  necessary  before i can open my business  that i should hear your name  from yourself       well  sir   cried she with some hesitation   you can scarce have come  to this house  without knowing that its owner is cecilia beverley       that  madam  is your maiden name       my maiden name   cried she  starting      are you not married  madam       married  sir   she repeated  while her cheeks were the colour of  scarlet      it is  properly  therefore  madam  the name of your husband that i mean  to ask       and by what authority  sir   cried she  equally astonished and  offended   do you make these extraordinary enquiries       i am deputed  madam  to wait upon you by mr eggleston  the next heir  to this estate  by your uncle s will  if you die without children  or  change your name when you marry  his authority of enquiry  madam   i presume you will allow  and he has vested it in me by a letter of  attorney      cecilia s distress and confusion were now unspeakable  she knew not what  to own or deny  she could not conjecture how she had been betrayed  and  she had never made the smallest preparation against such an attack      mr eggleston  madam   he continued   has been pretty credibly informed  that you are actually married  he is very desirous  therefore  to  know what are your intentions  for your continuing to be called  miss   beverley  as if still single  leaves him quite in the dark  but  as he  is so deeply concerned in the affair  he expects  as a lady of honour   you will deal with him without prevarication       this demand  sir   said cecilia  stammering   is so extremely  so  so  little expected        the way  madam  in these cases  is to keep pretty closely to the point   are you married or are you not      cecilia  quite confounded  made no answer  to disavow her marriage  when  thus formally called upon  was every way unjustifiable  to acknowledge  it in her present situation  would involve her in difficulties  innumerable      this is not  madam  a slight thing  mr eggleston has a large family and  a small fortune  and that  into the bargain  very much encumbered   it cannot  therefore  be expected that he will knowingly connive at  cheating himself  by submitting to your being actually married  and  still enjoying your estate though your husband does not take your name      cecilia  now  summoning more presence of mind  answered   mr eggleston   sir  has  at least  nothing to fear from imposition  those with whom he  has  or may have any transactions in this affair  are not accustomed to  practice it       i am far from meaning any offence  madam  my commission from mr  eggleston is simply this  to beg you will satisfy him upon what grounds  you now evade the will of your late uncle  which  till cleared up   appears a point manifestly to his prejudice       tell him  then  sir  that whatever he wishes to know shall be explained  to him in about a week  at present i can give no other answer       very well  madam  he will wait that time  i am sure  for he does not  wish to put you to any inconvenience  but when he heard the gentleman  was gone abroad without owning his marriage  he thought it high time to  take some notice of the matter      cecilia  who by this speech found she was every way discovered  was  again in the utmost confusion  and with much trepidation  said   since  you seem so well  sir  acquainted with this affair  i should be glad you  would inform me by what means you came to the knowledge of it       i heard it  madam  from mr eggleston himself  who has long known it       long  sir   impossible  when it is not yet a fortnight  not ten days   or no more  that        she stopt  recollecting she was making a confession better deferred      that  madam   he answered   may perhaps bear a little contention  for  when this business comes to be settled  it will be very essential to  be exact as to the time  even to the very hour  for a large income per  annum  divides into a small one per diem  and if your husband keeps his  own name  you must not only give up your uncle s inheritance from  the time of relinquishing yours  but refund from the very day of your  marriage       there is not the least doubt of it   answered she   nor will the  smallest difficulty be made       you will please  then  to recollect  madam  that this sum is every hour  encreasing  and has been since last september  which made half a year  accountable for last march  since then there is now added         good heaven  sir   cried cecilia   what calculation are you making out   do you call last week last september       no  madam  but i call last september the month in which you were  married       you will find yourself  then  sir  extremely mistaken  and mr eggleston  is preparing himself for much disappointment  if he supposes me so long  in arrears with him       mr eggleston  madam  happens to be well informed of this transaction   as  if there is any dispute in it  you will find  he was your immediate  successor in the house to which you went last september in pall mall   the woman who kept it acquainted his servants that the last lady who  hired it stayed with her but a day  and only came to town  she found  to  be married  and hearing  upon enquiry  this lady was miss beverley  the  servants  well knowing that their master was her conditional heir  told  him the circumstance       you will find all this  sir  end in nothing       that  madam  as i said before  remains to be proved  if a young lady at  eight o clock in the morning  is seen   and she was seen  going into a  church with a young gentleman  and one female friend  and is afterwards  observed to come out of it  followed by a clergyman and another person   supposed to have officiated as father  and is seen get into a coach with  same young gentleman  and same female friend  why the circumstances are  pretty strong         they may seem so  sir  but all conclusions drawn from them will be  erroneous  i was not married then  upon my honour       we have little  madam  to do with professions  the circumstances are  strong enough to bear a trial  and        a trial         we have traced  madam  many witnesses able to stand to divers  particulars  and eight months share of such an estate as this  is well  worth a little trouble       i am amazed  sir  surely mr eggleston never desired you to make use of  this language to me       mr eggleston  madam  has behaved very honourably  though he knew  the whole affair so long ago  he was persuaded mr delvile had private  reasons for a short concealment  and expecting every day when they would  be cleared up by his taking your name  he never interfered  but being  now informed he set out last week for the continent  he has been advised  by his friends to claim his rights       that claim  sir  he need not fear will be satisfied  and without any  occasion for threats of enquiries or law suits       the truth  madam  is this  mr eggleston is at present in a little  difficulty about some money matters  which makes it a point with him of  some consequence to have the affair settled speedily  unless you could  conveniently compromise the matter  by advancing a particular sum   till it suits you to refund the whole that is due to him  and quit the  premises       nothing  sir  is due to him  at least  nothing worth mentioning  i  shall enter into no terms  for i have no compromise to make  as to the  premises  i will quit them with all the expedition in my power       you will do well  madam  for the truth is  it will not be convenient to  him to wait much longer      he then went away      when  next   cried cecilia   shall i again be weak  vain  blind enough  to form any plan with a hope of secresy  or enter  with  any  hope  into  a clandestine scheme  betrayed by those i have trusted  discovered  by those i have not thought of  exposed to the cruellest alarms  and  defenceless from the most shocking attacks   such has been the life i  have led since the moment i first consented to a private engagement   ah  delvile  your mother  in her tenderness  forgot her dignity  or she  would not have concurred in an action which to such disgrace made me  liable          chapter iv     a deliberation     it was necessary  however  not to moralize  but to act  cecilia had  undertaken to give her answer in a week  and the artful attorney had  drawn from her an acknowledgment of her situation  by which he might  claim it yet sooner     the law suit with which she was threatened for the arrears of eight  months  alarmed her not  though it shocked her  as she was certain she  could prove her marriage so much later     it was easy to perceive that this man had been sent with a view of  working from her a confession  and terrifying from her some money   the confession  indeed  in conscience and honesty she could not wholly  elude  but she had suffered too often by a facility in parting with  money to be there easily duped     nothing  however  was more true  than that she now lived upon an estate  of which she no longer was the owner  and that all she either spent or  received was to be accounted for and returned  since by the will of her  uncle  unless her husband took her name  her estate on the very day of  her marriage was to be forfeited  and entered upon by the egglestons   delvile s plan and hope of secresy had made them little weigh this  matter  though this premature discovery so unexpectedly exposed her to  their power     the first thought that occurred to her  was to send an express to  delvile  and desire his instructions how to proceed  but she dreaded his  impetuosity of temper  and was almost certain that the instant he should  hear she was in any uneasiness or perplexity  he would return to her  at  all hazards  even though mr monckton were dead  and his mother herself  dying  this step  therefore  she did not dare risk  preferring any  personal hardship  to endangering the already precarious life of mrs  delvile  or to hastening her son home while mr monckton was in so  desperate a situation     but though what to avoid was easy to settle  what to seek was difficult  to devise  she bad now no mrs charlton to receive her  not a creature in  whom she could confide  to continue her present way of living was deeply  involving delvile in debt  a circumstance she had never considered  in  the confusion and hurry attending all their plans and conversations  and  a circumstance which  though to him it might have occurred  he could not  in common delicacy mention     yet to have quitted her house  and retrenched her expences  would have  raised suspicions that must have anticipated the discovery she so much  wished to have delayed  that wish  by the present danger of its failure   was but more ardent  to have her affairs and situation become  publicly known at the present period  she felt would half distract  her   privately married  parted from her husband at the very moment of  their union  a husband by whose hand the apparent friend of her earliest  youth was all but killed  whose father had execrated the match  whose  mother was now falling a sacrifice to the vehemence with which she had  opposed it  and who himself  little short of an exile  knew not yet  if  with personal safety  he might return to his native land  to  circumstances so dreadful  she had now the additional shock of being  uncertain whether her own house might not be seized  before any other  could be prepared for her reception     yet still whither to go  what to do  or what to resolve  she was wholly  unable to determine  and after meditating almost to madness in the  search of some plan or expedient  she was obliged to give over the  attempt  and be satisfied with remaining quietly where she was  till she  had better news from delvile of his mother  or better news to send him  of mr monckton  carefully  mean time  in all her letters avoiding to  alarm him by any hint of her distress     yet was she not idle  either from despair or helplessness  she found her  difficulties encreased  and she called forth more resolution to combat  them  she animated herself by the promise she had made delvile  and  recovering from the sadness to which she had at first given way  she now  exerted herself with vigour to perform it as she ought     she began by making an immediate inspection into her affairs  and  endeavouring  where expence seemed unnecessary  to lessen it  she gave  henrietta to understand she feared they must soon part  and so afflicted  was the unhappy girl at the news  that she found it the most cruel  office she had to execute  the same intimation she gave to mrs harrel   who repined at it more openly  but with a selfishness so evident that it  blunted the edge of pity  she then announced to albany her inability to  pursue  at present  their extensive schemes of benevolence  and though  he instantly left her  to carry on his laborious plan elsewhere  the  reverence she had now excited in him of her character  made him leave  her with no sensation but of regret  and readily promise to return when  her affairs were settled  or her mind more composed     these little preparations  which were all she could make  with enquiries  after mr monckton  and writing to delvile  sufficiently filled up her  time  though her thoughts were by no means confined to them  day after  day passed  and mr monckton continued to linger rather than live  the  letters of delvile  still only dated from ostend  contained the most  melancholy complaints of the illness of his mother  and the time  advanced when her answer would be claimed by the attorney     the thought of such another visit was almost intolerable  and within two  days of the time that she expected it  she resolved to endeavour herself  to prevail with mr eggleston to wait longer     mr eggleston was a gentleman whom she knew little more than by sight  he  was no relation to her family  nor had any connection with the dean   but by being a cousin to a lady he had married  and who had left him  no children  the dean had no particular regard for him  and had rather  mentioned him in his will as the successor of cecilia  in case she died  unmarried or changed her name  as a mark that he approved of her doing  neither  than as a matter he thought probable  if even possible  to turn  out in his favour     he was a man of a large family  the sons of which  who were extravagant  and dissipated  had much impaired his fortune by prevailing with him to  pay their debts  and much distressed him in his affairs by successfully  teasing him for money     cecilia  acquainted with these circumstances  knew but too well with  what avidity her estate would be seized by them  and how little the sons  would endure delay  even if the father consented to it  yet since the  sacrifice to which she had agreed must soon make it indisputably  their own  she determined to deal with them openly  and acknowledged   therefore  in her letter  her marriage without disguise  but begged  their patience and secresy  and promised  in a short time  the most  honourable retribution and satisfaction     she sent this letter by a man and horse  mr eggleston s habitation being  within fifteen miles of her own     the answer was from his eldest son  who acquainted her that his father  was very ill  and had put all his affairs into the hands of mr carn  his  attorney  who was a man of great credit  and would see justice done on  all sides     if this answer  which she broke open the instant she took it into  her hand  was in itself a cruel disappointment to her  how was that  disappointment embittered by shame and terror  when  upon again folding  it up  she saw it was directed to mrs mortimer delvile     this was a decisive stroke  what they wrote to her  she was sure they  would mention to all others  she saw they were too impatient for her  estate to be moved by any representations to a delay  and that their  eagerness to publish their right  took from them all consideration of  what they might make her suffer  mr eggleston  she found  permitted  himself to be wholly governed by his son  his son was a needy and  profligate spendthrift  and by throwing the management of the affair  into the hands of an attorney  craftily meant to shield himself from the  future resentment of delvile  to whom  hereafter  he might affect  at  his convenience  to disapprove mr carn s behaviour  while mr carn was  always secure  by averring he only exerted himself for the interest of  his client     the discerning cecilia  though but little experienced in business  and  wholly unsuspicious by nature  yet saw into this management  and doubted  not these excuses were already arranged  she had only  therefore  to  save herself an actual ejectment  by quitting a house in which she was  exposed to such a disgrace     but still whither to go she knew not  one only attempt seemed in her  power for an honourable asylum  and that was more irksomely painful to  her than seeking shelter in the meanest retreat  it was applying to mr  delvile senior     the action of leaving her house  whether quietly or forcibly  could not  but instantly authenticate the reports spread by the egglestons of her  marriage  to hope therefore for secresy any longer would be folly  and  mr delvile s rage at such intelligence might be still greater to hear  it by chance than from herself  she now lamented that delvile had not  at once told the tale  but  little foreseeing such a discovery as the  present  they had mutually concluded to defer the communication till his  return     her own anger at the contemptuous ill treatment she had repeatedly met  from him  she was now content not merely to suppress but to dismiss   since  as the wife of his son without his consent  she considered  herself no longer as wholly innocent of incurring it  yet  such was her  dread of his austerity and the arrogance of his reproaches  that  by  choice  she would have preferred an habitation with her own pensioner   the pew opener  to the grandest apartment in delvile castle while he  continued its lord     in her present situation  however  her choice was little to be  consulted  the honour of delvile was concerned in her escaping even  temporary disgrace  and nothing  she knew  would so much gratify him  as  any attention from her to his father  she wrote to him  therefore  the  following letter  which she sent by an express      to the hon  compton delvile     april   th            sir   i should not  even by letter  presume thus to force myself upon  your remembrance  did i not think it a duty i now owe your son  both to  risk and to bear the displeasure it may unhappily occasion  after  such an acknowledgment  all other confession would be superfluous  and  uncertain as i am if you will ever deign to own me  more words than are  necessary would be merely impertinent     it was the intention of your son  sir  when he left the kingdom  to  submit wholly to your arbitration  at his return  which should be  resigned  his own name or my fortune  but his request for your decision   and his supplication for your forgiveness  are both  most unfortunately   prevented  by a premature and unforeseen discovery of our situation   which renders an immediate determination absolutely unavoidable     at this distance from him  i cannot  in time  receive his directions  upon the measures i have to take  pardon me then  sir  if well knowing  my reference to him will not be more implicit than his own to you  i  venture  in the present important crisis of my affairs  to entreat those  commands instantly  by which i am certain of being guided ultimately     i would commend myself to your favour but that i dread exciting your  resentment  i will detain you  therefore  only to add  that the father  of mr mortimer delvile  will ever meet the most profound respect from  her who  without his permission  dare sign no name to the honour she now  has in declaring herself his most humble  and most obedient servant                  her mind was somewhat easier when this letter was written  because she  thought it a duty  yet felt reluctance in performing it  she wished to  have represented to him strongly the danger of delvile s hearing her  distress  but she knew so well his inordinate self sufficiency  she  feared a hint of that sort might be construed into an insult  and  concluded her only chance that he would do any thing  was by leaving  wholly to his own suggestions the weighing and settling what     but though nothing was more uncertain than whether she should be  received at delvile castle  nothing was more fixed than that she must  quit her own house  since the pride of mr delvile left not even a chance  that his interest would conquer it  she deferred not  therefore  any  longer making preparations for her removal  though wholly unsettled  whither     her first  which was also her most painful task  was to acquaint  henrietta with her situation  she sent  therefore  to desire to speak  with her  but the countenance of henrietta shewed her communication  would not surprise her      what is the matter with my dear henrietta   cried cecilia   who is  it has already afflicted that kind heart which i am now compelled to  afflict for myself      henrietta  in whom anger appeared to be struggling with sorrow   answered   no  madam  not afflicted for  you   it would be strange if i  were  thinking as i think       i am glad   said cecilia  calmly   if you are not  for i would give to  you  were it possible  nothing but pleasure and joy       ah madam   cried henrietta  bursting into tears   why will you say so  when you don t care what becomes of me  when you are going to cast me  off   and when you will soon be too happy ever to think of me more       if i am never happy till then   said cecilia   sad  indeed  will be  my life  no  my gentlest friend  you will always have your share in  my heart  and always  to me  would have been the welcomest guest in my  house  but for those unhappy circumstances which make our separating  inevitable       yet you suffered me  madam  to hear from any body that you was married  and going away  and all the common servants in the house knew it before  me       i am amazed   said cecilia   how and which way can they have heard it       the man that went to mr eggleston brought the first news of it  for  he said all the servants there talked of nothing else  and that their  master was to come and take possession here next thursday      cecilia started at this most unwelcome intelligence   yet you envy  me   she cried   henrietta  though i am forced from my house  though in  quitting it  i am unprovided with any other  and though him for whom  i relinquish it  is far off  without means of protecting  or power of  returning to me       but you are married to him  madam   cried she  expressively      true  my love  but  also  i am parted from him       oh how differently   exclaimed henrietta   do the great think from  the little  were  i  married   and  so  married  i should want neither  house  nor fine cloaths  nor riches  nor any thing   i should not care  where i lived   every place would be paradise  i would walk to him  barefoot if he were a thousand miles off  and i should mind nobody else  in the world while i had him to take care of me      ah delvile  thought cecilia  what powers of fascination are yours   should i be tempted to repine at what i have to bear  i will think of  this heroick girl and blush     mrs harrel now broke in upon them  eager to be informed of the truth or  falsehood of the reports which were buzzed throughout the house   cecilia briefly related to them both the state of her affairs  earnestly  expressing her concern at the abrupt separation which must take place   and for which she had been unable to prepare them  as the circumstances  which led to it had been wholly unforeseen by herself     mrs harrel listened to the account with much curiosity and surprize  but  henrietta wept incessantly in hearing it  the object of a passion ardent  as it was romantic  lost to her past recovery  torn herself  probably  for ever  from the best friend she had in the world  and obliged to  return thus suddenly to an home she detested   henrietta possessed not  the fortitude to hear evils such as these  which  to her inexperienced  heart  appeared the severest that could be inflicted     this conversation over  cecilia sent for her steward  and desired him   with the utmost expedition  to call in all her bills  and instantly to  go round to her tenants within twenty miles  and gather in  from those  who were able to pay  the arrears now due to her  charging him  however   upon no account  to be urgent with such as seemed distressed     the bills she had to pay were collected without difficulty  she never  owed much  and creditors are seldom hard of access  but the money she  hoped to receive fell very short of her expectations  for the indulgence  she had shewn to her tenants had ill prepared them for so sudden a  demand         chapter v     a decision     this business effectually occupied the present and following day  the  third  cecilia expected her answer from delvile castle  and the visit  she so much dreaded from the attorney     the answer arrived first      to miss beverley      madam   as my son has never apprized me of the extraordinary step which  your letter intimates  i am too unwilling to believe him capable of so  far forgetting what he owes his family  to ratify any such intimation by  interfering with my counsel or opinion   i am  madam   c      compton delvile     delvile castle   may  st            cecilia had little right to be surprised by this letter  and she had not  a moment to comment upon it  before the attorney arrived      well  madam   said the man  as he entered the parlour   mr eggleston  has stayed your own time very patiently  he commissions me now to  enquire if it is convenient to you to quit the premises       no  sir  it is by no means convenient to me  and if mr eggleston will  wait some time longer  i shall be greatly obliged to him       no doubt  madam  but he will  upon proper considerations       what  sir  do you call proper       upon your advancing to him  as i hinted before  an immediate particular  sum from what must  by and bye  be legally restituted       if this is the condition of his courtesy  i will quit the house without  giving him further trouble       just as it suits you  madam  he will be glad to take possession  to morrow or next day       you did well  sir  to commend his patience  i shall  however  merely  discharge my servants  and settle my accounts  and be ready to make way  for him       you will not take it amiss  madam  if i remind you that the account  with mr eggleston must be the first that is settled       if you mean the arrears of this last fortnight or three weeks   i believe i must desire him to wait mr delvile s return  as i may  otherwise myself be distressed for ready money       that  madam  is not likely  as it is well known you have a fortune that  was independent of your late uncle  and as to distress for ready money   it is a plea mr eggleston can urge much more strongly       this is being strangely hasty  sir   so short a time as it is since mr  eggleston could expect  any  of this estate       that  madam  is nothing to the purpose  from the moment it is his  he  has as many wants for it as any other gentleman  he desired me  however   to acquaint you  that if you still chose an apartment in this house   till mr delvile returns  you shall have one at your service       to be a  guest  in this house  sir   said cecilia  drily   might  perhaps seem strange to me  i will not  therefore  be so much in his  way      mr carn then informed her she might put her seal upon whatever she meant  hereafter to claim or dispute  and took his leave     cecilia now shut herself up in her own room  to meditate without  interruption  before she would proceed to any action  she felt much  inclination to send instantly for some lawyer  but when she considered  her peculiar situation  the absence of her husband  the renunciation of  his father  the loss of her fortune  and her ignorance upon the subject   she thought it better to rest quiet till delvile s own fate  and own  opinion could be known  than to involve herself in a lawsuit she was so  little able to superintend     in this cruel perplexity of her mind and her affairs  her first thought  was to board again with mrs bayley  but that was soon given up  for she  felt a repugnance unconquerable to continuing in her native county  when  deprived of her fortune  and cast out of her dwelling     her situation  indeed  was singularly unhappy  since  by this unforeseen  vicissitude of fortune  she was suddenly  from being an object of envy  and admiration  sunk into distress  and threatened with disgrace  from  being every where caressed  and by every voice praised  she blushed to  be seen  and expected to be censured  and  from being generally regarded  as an example of happiness  and a model of virtue  she was now in  one moment to appear to the world  an outcast from her own house  yet  received into no other  a bride  unclaimed by a husband  an heiress   dispossessed of all wealth     to be first acknowledged as  mrs delvile  in a state so degrading  she  could not endure  and to escape from it  one way alone remained  which  was going instantly abroad     upon this  therefore  she finally determined  her former objections to  such a step being now wholly  though unpleasantly removed  since she had  neither estate nor affairs to demand her stay  and since all hopes of  concealment were totally at an end  her marriage  therefore  and its  disgraceful consequences being published to the world  she resolved  without delay to seek the only asylum which was proper for her  in the  protection of the husband for whom she had given up every other     she purposed  therefore  to go immediately and privately to london   whence she could best settle her route for the continent  where she  hoped to arrive before the news of her distress reached delvile  whom  nothing  she was certain  but her own presence  could keep there for a  moment after hearing it     thus decided  at length  in her plan  she proceeded to put it in  execution with calmness and intrepidity  comforting herself that the  conveniencies and indulgencies with which she was now parting  would  soon be restored to her  and though not with equal power  with far more  satisfaction  she told her steward her design of going the next morning  to london  bid him pay instantly all her debts  and discharge all  her servants  determining to keep no account open but that with mr  eggleston  which he had made so intricate by double and undue demands   that she thought it most prudent and safe to leave him wholly to  delvile     she then packed up all her papers and letters  and ordered her maid to  pack up her clothes     she next put her own seal upon her cabinets  draws  and many other  things  and employed almost all her servants at once  in making complete  inventories of what every room contained     she advised mrs harrel to send without delay for mr arnott  and return  to his house  she had first purposed to carry henrietta home to her  mother herself  but another scheme for her now occurred  from which she  hoped much future advantage to the amiable and dejected girl     she knew well  that deep as was at present her despondency  the removal  of all possibility of hope  by her knowledge of delvile s marriage  must  awaken her before long from the delusive visions of her romantic fancy   mr arnott himself was in a situation exactly similar  and the knowledge  of the same event would probably be productive of the same effect  when  mrs harrel  therefore  began to repine at the solitude to which she was  returning  cecilia proposed to her the society of henrietta  which  glad  to catch at any thing that would break into her loneliness  she listened  to with pleasure  and seconded by an invitation     henrietta  to whom all houses appeared preferable to her own home   joyfully accepted the offer  committing to cecilia the communication of  the change of her abode to mrs belfield     cecilia  who in the known and tried honour of mr arnott would  unreluctantly have trusted a sister  was much pleased by this little  arrangement  from which should no good ensue  no evil  at least  was  probable  but she hoped  through the mutual pity their mutual melancholy  might inspire  that their minds  already not dissimilar  would be  softened in favour of each other  and that  in conclusion  each might  be happy in receiving the consolation each could give  and a union would  take place  in which their reciprocal disappointment might  in time  be  nearly forgotten     there was not  indeed  much promise of such an event in the countenance  of mr arnott  when  late at night  he came for his sister  nor in the  unbounded sorrow of henrietta  when the moment of leave taking arrived   mr arnott looked half dead with the shock his sister s intelligence had  given him  and henrietta s heart  torn asunder between friendship  and love  was scarce able to bear a parting  which from cecilia  she  regarded as eternal  added to the consciousness it was occasioned by her  going to join delvile for life     cecilia  who both read and pitied these conflicting emotions  was  herself extremely hurt by this necessary separation  she tenderly  loved henrietta  she loved her even the more for the sympathy of their  affections  which called forth the most forcible commiseration   that  which springs from fellow feeling      farewell   she cried   my henrietta  be but happy as you are innocent   and be both as i love you  and nothing will your friends have to wish  for you  or yourself to regret       i must always regret   cried the sobbing henrietta   that i cannot live  with you for ever  i should regret it if i were queen of all the world   how much more then  when i am nothing and nobody  i do not wish  you   happy  madam  for i think happiness was made on purpose for you  and  nobody else ever had it before  i only wish you health and long life   for the sake of those who will be made as happy as you   for you will  spoil them   as you have spoilt me   from being ever happy without you      cecilia re iterated her assurances of a most faithful regard  embraced  mrs harrel  spoke words of kindness to the drooping mr arnott  and then  parted with them all     having still many small matters to settle  and neither company nor  appetite  she would eat no supper  but  in passing thro  the hall  in  her way to her own room  she was much surprised to see all her domestics  assembled in a body  she stopt to enquire their intention  when they  eagerly pressed forward  humbly and earnestly entreating to know why  they were discharged   for no reason in the world   cried cecilia   but  because it is at present out of my power to keep you any longer       don t part with  me   madam  for that   cried one of them   for i will  serve you for nothing       so will i   cried another   and i    and i   was echoed by them all   while  no other such mistress is to be found    we can never bear any  other place   and  keep  me   madam  at least   was even clamorously  urged by each of them     cecilia  distressed and flattered at once by their unwillingness to  quit her  received this testimony of gratitude for the kind and liberal  treatment they had received  with the warmest thanks both for their  services and fidelity  and assured them that when again she was settled   all those who should be yet unprovided with places  should be preferred  in her house before any other claimants     having  with difficulty  broken from them  she sent for her own man   ralph  who had lived with her many years before the death of the dean   and told him she meant still to continue him in her service  the man  heard it with great delight  and promised to re double his diligence to  deserve her favour  she then communicated the same news to her maid  who  had also resided with her some years  and by whom with the same  or more  pleasure it was heard     these and other regulations employed her almost all night  yet late  and fatigued as she went to bed  she could not close her eyes  fearful  something was left undone  she robbed herself of the short time she had  allowed to rest  by incessant meditation upon what yet remained to be  executed  she could recollect  however  one only thing that had escaped  her vigilance  which was acquainting the pew opener  and two or three  other poor women who had weekly pensions from her  that they must  at  least for the present  depend no longer upon her assistance     nothing indeed could be more painful to her than giving them such  information  yet not to be speedy with it would double the barbarity of  their disappointment  she even felt for these poor women  whose loss in  her she knew would be irreparable  a compassion that drove from her mind  almost every other subject  and determined her  in order to soften to  them this misfortune  to communicate it herself  that she might prevent  them from sinking under it  by reviving them with hopes of her future  assistance     she had ordered at seven o clock in the morning an hired chaise at the  door  and she did not suffer it long to wait for her  she quitted her  house with a heart full of care and anxiety  grieving at the necessity  of making such a sacrifice  uncertain how it would turn out  and  labouring under a thousand perplexities with respect to the measures  she ought immediately to take  she passed  when she reached the hall   through a row of weeping domestics  not one of whom with dry eyes could  see the house bereft of such a mistress  she spoke to them all with  kindness  and as much as was in her power with chearfulness  but the  tone of her voice gave them little reason to think the concern at this  journey was all their own     she ordered her chaise to drive round to the pew opener s and thence to  the rest of her immediate dependents  she soon  however  regretted that  she had given herself this task  the affliction of these poor pensioners  was clamorous  was almost heart breaking  they could live  they said  no  longer  they were ruined for ever  they should soon be without bread  to eat  and they might cry for help in vain  when their generous  their  only benefactress was far away     cecilia made the kindest efforts  to comfort and encourage them   assuring them the very moment her own affairs were arranged  she would  remember them all  visit them herself  and contribute to their relief   with all the power she should have left  nothing  however  could console  them  they clung about her  almost took the horses from the chaise   and conjured her not to desert those who were solely cherished by her  bounty     nor was this all she had to suffer  the news of her intention to quit  the county was now reported throughout the neighbourhood  and had spread  the utmost consternation among the poor in general  and the lower close  of her own tenants in particular  and the road was soon lined with  women and children  wringing their hands and crying  they followed  her carriage with supplications that she would return to them  mixing  blessings with their lamentations  and prayers for her happiness with  the bitterest repinings at their own loss     cecilia was extremely affected  her liberal and ever ready hand was  every other instant involuntarily seeking her purse  which her many  immediate expences  made her prudence as often check  and now first she  felt the capital error she had committed  in living constantly to the  utmost extent of her income  without ever preparing  though so able to  have done it  against any unfortunate contingency     when she escaped  at last  from receiving any longer this painful  tribute to her benevolence  she gave orders to her man to ride forward  and stop at the grove  that a precise and minute account of mr monckton   might be the last  as it was now become the most important  news she  should hear in suffolk  this he did  when to her equal surprise and  delight  she heard that he was suddenly so much better  there were hopes  of his recovery     intelligence so joyful made her amends for almost every thing  yet she  hesitated not in her plan of going abroad  as she knew not where to be  in england  and could not endure to hurry delvile from his sick mother   by acquainting him with her helpless and distressed situation  but so  revived were her spirits by these unexpected tidings  that a gleam of  brightest hope once more danced before her eyes  and she felt herself  invigorated with fresh courage and new strength  sufficient to support  her through all hardships and fatigues     spirits and courage were indeed much wanted for the enterprize she had  formed  but little used to travelling  and having never been out of  england  she knew nothing of the route but by a general knowledge of  geography  which  though it could guide her east or west  could teach  her nothing of foreign customs  the preparations necessary for the  journey  the impositions she should guard against  nor the various  dangers to which she might be exposed  from total ignorance of the  country through which she had to pass     conscious of these deficiencies for such an undertaking  she deliberated  without intermission how to obviate them  yet sometimes  when to these  hazards  those arising from her youth and sex were added  she was upon  the point of relinquishing her scheme  as too perilous for execution   and resolving to continue privately in london till some change happened  in her affairs     but though to every thing she could suggest  doubts and difficulties  arose  she had no friend to consult  nor could devise any means by which  they might be terminated  her maid was her only companion  and ralph   who had spent almost his whole life in suffolk  her only guard and  attendant  to hire immediately some french servant  used to travelling  in his own country  seemed the first step she had to take  and so  essential  that no other appeared feasible till it was done  but where  to hear of such a man she could not tell  and to take one not  well recommended  would be exposing herself to frauds and dangers  innumerable     yet so slow as delvile travelled  from whom her last letter was still  dated ostend  she thought herself almost certain  could she once reach  the continent  of overtaking him in his route within a day or two of her  landing     the earnest inclination with which this scheme was seconded  made her  every moment less willing to forego it  it seemed the only harbour for  her after the storm she had weathered  and the only refuge she could  properly seek while thus houseless and helpless  even were delvile in  england  he had no place at present to offer her  nor could any thing be  proposed so unexceptionable as her living with mrs delvile at nice   till he knew his father s pleasure  and  in a separate journey home  had  arranged his affairs either for her return  or her continuance abroad     with what regret did she now look back to the time when  in a distress  such as this  she should have applied for  and received the advice of  mr monckton as oracular  the loss of a counsellor so long  so implicitly  relied upon  lost to her also  only by his own interested worthlessness   she felt almost daily  for almost daily some intricacy or embarrassment  made her miss his assistance  and though glad  since she found him so  undeserving  that she had escaped the snares he had spread for her   she grieved much that she knew no man of honest character and equal  abilities  that would care for her sufficiently to supply his place in  her confidence     as she was situated at present  she could think only of mr belfield to  whom she could apply for any advice  nor even to him was the application  unexceptionable  the calumnies of mr delvile senior making it  disagreeable to her even to see him  but he was at once a man of  the world and a man of honour  he was the friend of mortimer  whose  confidence in him was great  and his own behaviour had uniformly shewn a  respect far removed from impertinence or vanity  and a mind superior to  being led to them by the influence of his gross mother  she had  indeed   when she last quitted his house  determined never to re enter it  but  determinations hasty or violent  are rarely observed  because rarely  practicable  she had promised henrietta to inform mrs belfield whither  she was gone  and reconcile her to the absence she still hoped to make  from home  she concluded  therefore  to go to portland street without  delay  and enquire openly and at once whether  and when  she might  speak with mr belfield  resolving  if tormented again by any forward  insinuations  to rectify all mistakes by acknowledging her marriage     she gave directions accordingly to the post boy and ralph     with respect to her own lodgings while in town  as money was no longer  unimportant to her  she meant from the belfields to go to the hills  by  whom she might be recommended to some reputable and cheap place  to the  belfields  however  though very late when she arrived in town  she  went first  unwilling to lose a moment in promoting her scheme of going  abroad     she left her maid in the chaise  and sent ralph on to mrs hill  with  directions to endeavour immediately to procure her a lodging         chapter vi     a prating     cecilia was shewn into a parlour  where mrs belfield was very earnestly  discoursing with mr hobson and mr simkins  and belfield himself  to her  great satisfaction  was already there  and reading      lack a day   cried mrs belfield   if one does not always see the people  one s talking of  why it was but this morning  madam  i was saying to mr  hobson  i wonder  says i  a young lady of such fortunes as miss beverley  should mope herself up so in the country  don t you remember it  mr  hobson       yes  madam   answered mr hobson   but i think  for my part  the young  lady s quite in the right to do as she s a mind  for that s what i call  living agreeable  and if i was a young lady to morrow  with such fine  fortunes  and that  it s just what i should do myself  for what i say  is this  where s the joy of having a little money  and being a little  matter above the world  if one has not one s own will       ma am   said mr simkins  who had scarce yet raised his head from the  profoundness of his bow upon cecilia s entrance into the room   if i may  be so free  may i make bold just for to offer you this chair       i called  madam   said cecilia  seizing the first moment in her power  to speak   in order to acquaint you that your daughter  who is perfectly  well  has made a little change in her situation  which she was anxious  you should hear from myself       ha  ha  stolen a match upon you  i warrant   cried the facetious mr  hobson   a good example for you  young lady  and if you take my advice   you won t be long before you follow it  for as to a lady  let her be  worth never so much  she s a mere nobody  as one may say  till she can  get herself a husband  being she knows nothing of business  and is made  to pay for every thing through the nose       fie  mr hobson  fie   said mr simkins   to talk so slighting of the  ladies before their faces  what one says in a corner  is quite of  another nature  but for to talk so rude in their company   i thought you  would scorn to do such a thing       sir  i don t want to be rude no more than yourself   said mr hobson    for what i say is  rudeness is a thing that makes nobody agreeable   but i don t see because of that  why a man is not to speak his mind to  a lady as well as to a gentleman  provided he does it in a complaisant  fashion       mr hobson   cried mrs belfield  very impatiently   you might as well  let  me  speak  when the matter is all about my own daughter       i ask pardon  ma am   said he   i did not mean to stop you  for as to  not letting a lady speak  one might as well tell a man in business not  to look at the daily advertiser  why  it s morally impossible       but sure  madam   cried mrs belfield   it s no such thing  you can t  have got her off already       i would i had   thought cecilia  who then explained her meaning  but in  talking of mrs harrel  avoided all mention of mr arnott  well foreseeing  that to hear such a man existed  and was in the same house with her  daughter  would be sufficient authority to her sanguine expectations   for depending upon a union between them  and reporting it among her  friends  his circumstance being made clear  cecilia added   i could  by no means have consented voluntarily to parting so soon with miss  belfield  but that my own affairs call me at present out of the  kingdom   and then  addressing herself to belfield  she enquired if he  could recommend to her a trusty foreign servant  who would be hired only  for the time she was to spend abroad     while belfield was endeavouring to recollect some such person  mr hobson  eagerly called out  as to going abroad  madam  to be sure you re to do  as you like  for that  as i say  is the soul of every thing  but else i  can t say it s a thing i much approve  for my notion is this  here s a  fine fortune  got as a man may say  out of the bowels of one s mother  country  and this fine fortune  in default of male issue  is obliged to  come to a female  the law making no proviso to the contrary  well  this  female  going into a strange country  naturally takes with her this  fortune  by reason it s the main article she has to depend upon  what s  the upshot  why she gets pilfered by a set of sharpers that never saw  england in their lives  and that never lose sight of her till she has  not a sous in the world  but the hardship of the thing is this   when it s all gone  the lady can come back  but will the money come  back   no  you ll never see it again  now this is what i call being no  true patriot       i am quite ashamed for to hear you talk so  mr hobson   cried mr  simkins  affecting to whisper   to go for to take a person to task at  this rate  is behaving quite unbearable  it s enough to make the young  lady afraid to speak before you       why  mr simkins   answered mr hobson   truth is truth  whether one  speaks it or not  and that  ma am  i dare say  a young lady of your good  sense knows as well as myself       i think  madam   said belfield  who waited their silence with great  impatience   that i know just such a man as you will require  and one  upon whose honesty i believe you may rely       that s more   said mr hobson   than i would take upon me to say for  any  englishman   where you may meet with such a  frenchman   i won t be  bold to say       why indeed   said mr simkins   if i might take the liberty for to put  in  though i don t mean in no shape to go to contradicting the young  gentleman  but if i was to make bold to speak my private opinion upon  the head  i should be inclinable for to say  that as to putting a  dependance upon the french  it s a thing quite dubious how it may turn  out       i take it as a great favour  ma am   said mrs belfield   that you have  been so complaisant as to make me this visit to night  for i was almost  afraid you would not have done me the favour any more  for  to be sure   when you was here last  things went a little unlucky  but i had no  notion  for my part  who the old gentleman was till after he was gone   when mr hobson told me it was old mr delvile  though  sure enough  i  thought it rather upon the extraordinary order  that he should come here  into my parlour  and make such a secret of his name  on purpose to ask  me questions about my own son       why i think  indeed  if i may be so free   said mr simkins   it was  rather petickeler of the gentleman  for  to be sure  if he was so over  curious to hear about your private concerns  the genteel thing  if i may  take the liberty for to differ  would have been for him to say  ma am   says he  i m come to ask the favour of you just to let me a little into  your son s goings on  and any thing  ma am  you should take a fancy for  to ask me upon the return  why i shall be very compliable  ma am  says  he  to giving of you satisfaction       i dare say   answered mrs belfield   he would not have said so much if  you d have gone down on your knees to ask him  why he was upon the very  point of being quite in a passion because i only asked him his name   though what harm that could do him  i m sure i never could guess   however  as he was so mighty inquisitive about my son  if i had but  known who he was in time  i should have made no scruple in the world to  ask him if he could not have spoke a few words for him to some of those  great people that could have done him some good  but the thing that i  believe put him so out of humour  was my being so unlucky as to say   before ever i knew who he was  that i had heard he was not over and  above good natured  for i saw he did not seem much to like it at the  time       if he had done the generous thing   said mr simkins   it would have  been for him to have made the proffer of his services of his own  free will  and it s rather surpriseable to me he should never have  thought of it  for what could be so natural as for him to say  i see   ma am  says he  you ve got a very likely young gentleman here  that s a  little out of cash  says he  so i suppose  ma am  says he  a place  or a  pension  or something in that shape of life  would be no bad compliment   says he       but no such good luck as that will come to my share   cried mrs  belfield   i can tell you that  for every thing i want to do goes quite  contrary  who would not have thought such a son as mine  though i say it  before his face  could not have made his fortune long ago  living as he  did  among all the great folks  and dining at their table just like one  of themselves  yet  for all that  you see they let him go on his own  way  and think of him no more than of nobody  i m sure they might be  ashamed to shew their faces  and so i should tell them at once  if i  could but get sight of them       i don t mean  ma am   said mr simkins   for to be finding fault with  what you say  for i would not be unpelite in no shape  but if i might be  so free as for to differ a little bit  i must needs say i am rather for  going to work in anotherguess sort of a manner  and if i was as you        mr simkins   interrupted belfield   we will settle this matter another  time   and then  turning to the wearied cecilia   the man  madam   he  said   whom i have done myself the honour to recommend to you  i can see  to morrow morning  may i then tell him to wait upon you       i ask pardon for just putting in   cried mr simkins  before cecilia  could answer  and again bowing down to the ground   but i only mean to  say i had no thought for to be impertinent  for as to what i was agoing  to remark  is was not of no consequence in the least       its a great piece of luck  ma am   said mrs belfield   that you should  happen to come here  of a holiday  if my son had not been at home  i  should have been ready to cry for a week  and you might come any day the  year through but a sunday  and not meet with him any more than if he had  never a home to come to       if mr belfield s home visits are so periodical   said cecilia   it must  be rather less  than more  difficult to meet with him       why you know  ma am   answered mrs belfield   to day is a red letter  day  so that s the reason of it       a red letter day       good lack  madam  why have not you heard that my son is turned  book keeper      cecilia  much surprised  looked at belfield  who  colouring very high   and apparently much provoked by his mother s loquacity  said   had miss  beverley not heard it even now  madam  i should probably have lost with  her no credit       you can surely lose none  sir   answered cecilia   by an employment too  little pleasant to have been undertaken from any but the most laudable  motives       it is not  madam  the employment   said he   for which i so much blush  as for the person employed  for  myself   in the beginning of the winter  you left me just engaged in another business  a business with which  i was madly delighted  and fully persuaded i should be enchanted  for ever   now  again  in the beginning of the summer   you find me   already  in a new occupation       i am sorry   said cecilia   but far indeed from surprised  that you  found yourself deceived by such sanguine expectations       deceived   cried he  with energy   i was bewitched  i was infatuated   common sense was estranged by the seduction of a chimera  my  understanding was in a ferment from the ebullition of my imagination   but when this new way of life lost its novelty   novelty  that  short liv d  but exquisite bliss  no sooner caught than it vanishes  no  sooner tasted than it is gone  which charms but to fly  and comes but  to destroy what it leaves behind   when that was lost  reason  cool   heartless reason  took its place  and teaching me to wonder at the  frenzy of my folly  brought me back to the tameness  the sadness of  reality       i am sure   cried mrs belfield   whatever it has brought you back to   it has brought you back to no good  it s a hard case  you must needs  think  madam  to a mother  to see a son that might do whatever he would   if he d only set about it  contenting himself with doing nothing but  scribble and scribe one day  and when he gets tired of that  thinking of  nothing better than casting up two and two       why  madam   said mr hobson   what i have seen of the world is this   there s nothing methodizes a man but business  if he s never so much  upon the stilts  that s always a sure way to bring him down  by reason  he soon finds there s nothing to be got by rhodomontading  let every man  be his own carver  but what i say is  them gentlemen that are what one  may call geniuses  commonly think nothing of the main chance  till they  get a tap on the shoulder with a writ  and a solid lad  that knows three  times five is fifteen  will get the better of them in the long run  but  as to arguing with gentlemen of that sort  where s the good of it  you  can never bring them to the point  say what you will  all you can get  from them  is a farrago of fine words  that you can t understand without  a dictionary       i am inclinable to think   said mr simkins   that the young gentleman  is rather of opinion to like pleasure better than business  and  to be  sure  it s very excusable of him  because it s more agreeabler  and i  must needs say  if i may be so free  i m partly of the young gentleman s  mind  for business is a deal more trouble       i hope  however   said cecilia to belfield   your present situation is  less irksome to you       any situation  madam  must be less irksome than that which i quitted   to write by rule  to compose by necessity  to make the understanding   nature s first gift  subservient to interest  that meanest offspring of  art   when weary  listless  spiritless  to rack the head for invention   the memory for images  and the fancy for ornament and illusion  and when  the mind is wholly occupied by its own affections and affairs  to call  forth all its faculties for foreign subjects  uninteresting discussions   or fictitious incidents   heavens  what a life of struggle between  the head and the heart  how cruel  how unnatural a war between the  intellects and the feelings       as to these sort of things   said mr hobson   i can t say i am much  versed in them  by reason they are things i never much studied  but if i  was to speak my notion  it is this  the best way to thrive in the world  is to get money  but how is it to be got  why by business  for business  is to money  what fine words are to a lady  a sure road to success  now  i don t mean by this to be censorious upon the ladies  being they have  nothing else to go by  for as to examining if a man knows any thing of  the world  and that  they have nothing whereby to judge  knowing nothing  of it themselves  so that when they are taken in by rogues and sharpers   the fault is all in the law  for making no proviso against their having  money in their own hands  let every one be trusted according to their  headpiece and what i say is this  a lady in them cases is much to be  pitied  for she is obligated to take a man upon his own credit  which is  tantamount to no credit at all  being what man will speak an ill word of  himself  you may as well expect a bad shilling to cry out don t take me   that s what i say  and that s my way of giving my vote      cecilia  quite tired of these interruptions  and impatient to be gone   now said to belfield   i should be much obliged to you  sir  if you  could send to me the man you speak of tomorrow morning  i wished  also  to consult you with regard to the route i ought to take  my purpose is  to go to nice  and as i am very desirous to travel expeditiously  you  may perhaps be able to instruct me what is the best method for me to  pursue       come  mr hobson and mr simkins   cried mrs belfield  with a look of  much significance and delight   suppose you two and i was to walk into  the next room  there s no need for us to hear all the young lady may  have a mind to say       she has nothing to say  madam   cried cecilia   that the whole world  may not hear  neither is it my purpose to talk  but to listen  if mr  belfield is at leisure to favour me with his advice       i must always be at leisure  and always be proud  madam   belfield  began  when hobson  interrupting him  said   i ask pardon  sir  for  intruding  but i only mean to wish the young lady good night  as to  interfering with business  that s not my way  for it s not the right  method  by reason        we will listen to your reason  sir   cried belfield   some other time   at present we will give you all credit for it unheard       let every man speak his own maxim  sir   cried hobson   for that s what  i call fair arguing  but as to one person s speaking  and then making an  answer for another into the bargain  why it s going to work no how  you  may as well talk to a counter  and think because you make a noise upon  it with your own hand  it gives you the reply       why  mr hobson   cried mrs belfield   i am quite ashamed of you for  being so dull  don t you see my son has something to say to the lady  that you and i have no business to be meddling with       i m sure  ma am  for my part   said mr simkins   i m very agreeable to  going away  for as to putting the young lady to the blush  it s what i  would not do in no shape       i only mean   said mr hobson  when he was interrupted by mrs belfield   who  out of all patience  now turned him out of the room by the  shoulders  and  pulling mr simkins after  followed herself  and shut  the door  though cecilia  much provoked  desired she would stay  and  declared repeatedly that all her business was public     belfield  who had  looked ready to murder them all during this short  scene  now approached cecilia  and with an air of mingled spirit and  respect  said   i am much grieved  much confounded  madam  that your  ears should be offended by speeches so improper to reach them  yet if  it is possible i can have the honour of being of any use to you  in me   still  i hope  you feel you may confide  i am too distant from you in  situation to give you reason to apprehend i can form any sinister views  in serving you  and  permit me to add  i am too near you in mind  ever  to give you the pain of bidding me remember that distance      cecilia then  extremely unwilling to shock a sensibility not more  generous than jealous  determined to continue her enquiries  and  at  the same time  to prevent any further misapprehension  by revealing her  actual situation      i am sorry  sir   she answered   to have occasioned this disturbance   mrs belfield  i find  is wholly unacquainted with the circumstance which  now carries me abroad  or it would not have happened      here a little noise in the passage interrupting her  she heard mrs  belfield  though in a low voice  say   hush  sir  hush  you must not  come in just now  you ve caught me  i confess  rather upon the listening  order  but to tell you the truth  i did not know what might be going  forward  however  there s no admittance now  i assure you  for my son s  upon particular business with a lady  and mr hobson and mr simkins and  i  have all been as good as turned out by them but just now      cecilia and belfield  though they heard this speech with mutual  indignation  had no time to mark or express it  as it was answered  without in a voice at once loud and furious    you   madam  may be  content to listen here  pardon me if i am less humbly disposed   and the  door was abruptly opened by young delvile     cecilia  who half screamed from excess of astonishment  would scarcely   even by the presence of belfield and his mother  have been restrained  from flying to meet him  had his own aspect invited such a mark of  tenderness  but far other was the case  when the door was open  he stopt  short with a look half petrified  his feet seeming rooted to the spot  upon which they stood      i declare i ask pardon  ma am   cried mrs belfield   but the  interruption was no fault of mine  for the gentleman would come in   and        it is no interruption  madam   cried belfield   mr delvile does me  nothing but honour       i thank you  sir   said delvile  trying to recover and come forward   but trembling violently  and speaking with the most frigid coldness     they were then  for a few instants  all silent  cecilia  amazed by his  arrival  still more amazed by his behaviour  feared to speak lest  he meant not  as yet  to avow his marriage  and felt a thousand  apprehensions that some new calamity had hurried him home  while  belfield was both hurt by his strangeness  and embarrassed for the sake  of cecilia  and his mother  though wondering at them all  was kept quiet  by her son s looks     delvile then  struggling for an appearance of more ease  said   i seem  to have made a general confusion here   pray  i beg        none at all  sir   said belfield  and offered a chair to cecilia      no  sir   she answered  in a voice scarce audible   i was just going    and again rang the bell      i fear i hurry you  madam   cried delvile  whose whole frame was now  shaking with uncontrollable emotion   you are upon business  i ought to  beg your pardon  my entrance  i believe  was unseasonable         sir   cried she  looking aghast at this speech      i should have been rather surprised   he added   to have met you here   so late   so unexpectedly   so deeply engaged  had i not happened to see  your servant in the street  who told me the honour i should be likely to  have by coming       good god     exclaimed she  involuntarily  but  checking herself as  well as she could  she courtsied to mrs belfield  unable to speak to  her  and avoiding even to look at belfield  who respectfully hung back   she hastened out of the room  accompanied by mrs belfield  who again  began the most voluble and vulgar apologies for the intrusion she had  met with     delvile also  after a moment s pause  followed  saying   give me leave   madam  to see you to your carriage      cecilia then  notwithstanding mrs belfield still kept talking  could no  longer refrain saying   good heaven  what does all this mean       rather for  me  is that question   he answered  in such agitation he  could not  though he meant it  assist her into the chaise   for mine  i  believe  is the greater surprise       what surprise   cried she   explain  i conjure you       by and bye i will   he answered   go on postilion       where  sir       where you came from  i suppose       what  sir  back to rumford       rumford   exclaimed he  with encreasing disorder   you came then from  suffolk hither   from suffolk to this very house       good heaven   cried cecilia   come into the chaise  and let me speak  and hear to be understood       who is that now in it       my maid       your maid   and she waits for you thus at the door         what  what is it you mean       tell the man  madam  whither to go       i don t know myself  any where you please  do you order him       i order him   you came not hither to receive orders from  me    where  was it you had purposed to rest       i don t know  i meant to go to mrs hill s  i have no place taken         no place taken   repeated he  in a voice faultering between passion  and grief   you purposed  then  to stay here   i have perhaps driven you  away       here   cried cecilia  mingling  in her turn  indignation with surprise    gracious heaven  what is it you mean to doubt       nothing   cried he  with emphasis   i never have had  i never  will   have a doubt  i will know  i will have  conviction  for every thing   postilion  drive to st james s square   to mr delvile s  there  madam  i  will wait upon you       no  stay  postilion   called out cecilia  seized with terror  inexpressible   let me get out  let me speak with you at once       it cannot be  i will follow you in a few minutes  drive on  postilion       no  no   i will not go  i dare not leave you  unkind delvile   what is  it you suspect       cecilia   cried he  putting his hand upon the chaise door   i have  ever believed you spotless as an angel  and  by heaven  i believe you so  still  in spite of appearances  in defiance of every thing   now then be  satisfied   i will be with you very soon  meanwhile  take this letter   i was just going to send to you   postilion  drive on  or be at your  peril      the man waited no further orders  nor regarded the prohibition of  cecilia  who called out to him without ceasing  but he would not listen  to her till he got to the end of the street  he then stopt  and she  broke the seal of her letter  and read  by the light of the lamps   enough to let her know that delvile had written it upon the road from  dover to london  to acquaint her his mother was now better  and had  taken pity of his suspense and impatience  and insisted upon his coming  privately to england  to satisfy himself fully about mr monckton   communicate his marriage to his father  and give those orders towards  preparing for its being made public  which his unhappy precipitation in  leaving the kingdom had prevented     this letter  which  though written but a few hours before she received  it  was full of tenderness  gratitude and anxiety for her happiness   instantly convinced her that his strange behaviour had been wholly  the effect of a sudden impulse of jealousy  excited by so unexpectedly  finding her in town  at the very house where his father had assured  him she had an improper connexion  and alone  so suspiciously  with  the young man affirmed to be her favourite  he knew nothing of the  ejectment  nothing of any reason for her leaving suffolk  every thing  had the semblance of no motive but to indulge a private and criminal  inclination     these thoughts  which confusedly  yet forcibly  rushed upon her mind   brought with them at once an excuse for his conduct  and an alarm for  his danger   he must think   she cried   i came to town only to meet mr  belfield   then  opening the chaise door herself  she jumpt out  and ran  back into portland street  too impatient to argue with the postilion to  return with her  and stopt not till she came to mrs belfield s house     she knocked at the door with violence  mrs belfield came to it herself    where   cried she  hastily entering as she spoke   are the gentlemen       lack a day  ma am   answered mrs belfield   they are both gone out       gone out   where to   which way       i am sure i can t tell  ma am  no more than you can  but i am sadly  afraid they ll have a quarrel before they ve done       oh heaven   cried cecilia  who now doubted not a second duel   tell me   shew me  which way they went       why  ma am  to let you into the secret   answered mrs belfield   only i  beg you ll take no notice of it to my son  but  seeing them so much out  of sorts  i begged the favour of mr simkins  as mr hobson was gone out  to his club  just to follow them  and see what they were after      cecilia was much rejoiced this caution had been taken  and determined to  wait his return  she would have sent for the chaise to follow her  but  mrs belfield kept no servant  and the maid of the house was employed in  preparing the supper     when mr simkins came back  she learnt  after various interruptions from  mrs belfield  and much delay from his own slowness and circumlocution   that he had pursued the two gentlemen to the     coffee house     she hesitated not a moment in resolving to follow them  she feared the  failure of any commission  nor did she know whom to entrust with  one  and the danger was too urgent for much deliberation  she begged   therefore  that mr  simkins would walk with her to the chaise  but  hearing that the coffee house was another way  she desired mrs belfield  to let the servant run and order it to mrs roberts  in fetterlane  and  then eagerly requested mr simkins to accompany her on foot till they met  with an hackney coach     they then set out  mr simkins feeling proud and happy in being allowed  to attend her  while cecilia  glad of any protection  accepted his offer  of continuing with her  even after she met with an hackney coach     when she arrived at the coffee house  she ordered the coachman to desire  the master of it to come and speak with her     he came  and she hastily called out   pray  are two gentlemen here       here are several gentlemen here  madam       yes  yes   but are two upon any business  any particular business        two gentlemen  madam  came about half an hour ago  and asked for a room  to themselves       and where are they now   are they up stairs   down stairs   where are  they       one of them went away in about ten minutes  and the other soon after      bitterly chagrined and disappointed  she knew not what step to take  next  but  after some consideration  concluded upon obeying delvile s  own directions  and proceeding to st james s square  where alone  now   she seemed to have any chance of meeting with him  gladly  however  she  still consented to be accompanied by mr simkins  for her dread of being  alone  at so late an hour  in an hackney coach  was invincible  whether  delvile himself had any authority for directing her to his father s   or whether  in the perturbation of his new  excited and agonising  sensations of jealousy  he had forgotten that any authority was  necessary  she knew not  nor could she now interest herself in the  doubt  a second scene  such as had so lately passed with mr monckton   occupied all her thoughts  she knew the too great probability that  the high spirit of belfield would disdain making the explanation which  delvile in his present agitation might require  and the consequence of  such a refusal must almost inevitably be fatal         chapter vii     a pursuit     the moment the porter came to the door  cecilia eagerly called out from  the coach   is mr delvile here       yes  madam   he answered   but i believe he is engaged       oh no matter for any engagement   cried she   on the door   i must speak  to him this moment       if you will please to step into the parlour  madam  i will tell  his gentleman you are here  but he will be much displeased if he is  disturbed without notice       ah heaven   exclaimed she   what mr delvile are you talking of       my master  madam      cecilia  who had got out of the coach  now hastily returned to it   and was some time in too great agony to answer either the porter  who  desired some message  or the coachman  who asked whither he was to  drive  to see mr delvile  unprotected by his son  and contrary to his  orders  appeared to her insupportable  yet to what place could she go   where was she likely to meet with delvile  how could he find her if she  went to mrs hill s  and in what other house could she at present claim  admittance     after a little recovering from this cruel shock  she ventured  though in  a faultering voice  to enquire whether young mr delvile had been there      yes  madam   the porter answered   we thought he was abroad  but he  called just now  and asked if any lady had been at the house  he would  not even stay to go up to my master  and we have not dared tell him of  his arrival      this a little revived her  to hear that he had actually been enquiring  for her  at least assured her of his safety from any immediate violence   and she began to hope she might now possibly meet with him time  enough to explain all that had past in his absence  and occasioned her  seemingly strange and suspicious situation at belfield s  she compelled  herself  therefore  to summon courage for seeing his father  since  as  he had directed her to the house  she concluded he would return there to  seek her  when he had wandered elsewhere to no purpose     she then  though with much timidity and reluctance  sent a message to mr  delvile to entreat a moment s audience     an answer was brought her that he saw no company so late at night     losing now all dread of his reproaches  in her superior dread of missing  delvile  she called out earnestly to the man   tell him  sir  i beseech  him not to refuse me  tell him i have something to communicate that  requires his immediate attention      the servant obeyed  but soon returning  said his master desired him to  acquaint her he was engaged every moment he stayed in town  and must  positively decline seeing her      go to him again   cried the harassed cecilia   assure him i come not  from myself  but by the desire of one he most values  tell him i entreat  but permission to wait an hour in his house  and that i have no other  place in the world whither i can go      mr delvile s own gentleman brought  with evident concern  the answer  to this petition  which was  that while the honourable mr delvile was  himself alive  he thought the desire of any other person concerning his  house  was taking with him a very extraordinary liberty  and that he was  now going to bed  and had given orders to his servants to carry him no  more messages whatsoever  upon pain of instant dismission     cecilia now seemed totally destitute of all resource  and for a few  dreadful minutes  gave herself up to utter despondency  nor  when she  recovered her presence of mind  could she form any better plan than that  of waiting in the coach to watch the return of delvile     she told the coachman  therefore  to drive to a corner of the square   begging mr simkins to have patience  which he promised with much  readiness  and endeavoured to give her comfort  by talking without  cessation     she waited here near half an hour  she then feared the disappointment of  delvile in not meeting her at first  had made him conclude she meant  not to obey his directions  and had perhaps urged him to call again upon  belfield  whom he might fancy privy to her non appearance  this was  new horror to her  and she resolved at all risks to drive to  portland street  and enquire if belfield himself was returned home  yet   lest they should mutually be pursuing each other all night  she stopt  again at mr delvile s  and left word with the porter  that if young mr  delvile should come home  he would hear of the person he was enquiring  for at mrs roberts s in fetter lane  to belfield s she did not dare  to direct him  and it was her intention  if there she procured no new  intelligence  to leave the same message  and then go to mrs roberts  without further delay  to make such an arrangement with a servant who  knew not her connection with his young master  was extremely repugnant  to her  but the exigence was too urgent for scruples  and there was  nothing to which she would not have consented  to prevent the fatal  catastrophe she apprehended     when she came to belfield s  not daring to enter the house  she sent in  mr simkins  to desire that mrs belfield would be so good as to step to  the coach door      is your son  madam   she cried  eagerly   come home  and is any body  with him       no  ma am  he has never once been across the threshold since that  gentleman took him out  and i am half out of my wits to think        has that gentleman   interrupted cecilia   been here anymore       yes  ma am  that s what i was going to tell you  he came again just  now  and said        just now   good heaven   and which way is he gone       why he is after no good  i am afraid  for he was in a great passion   and would hardly hear any thing i said       pray  pray answer me quick   where  which way did he go       why  he asked me if i knew whither my son was come from the      coffee house  why  says i  i m sure i can t tell  for if it had not been  for mr simkins  i should not so much as have known he ever went to the      coffee house  however  i hope he a n t come away  because if he is   poor miss beverley will have had all that trouble for nothing  for she s  gone after him in a prodigious hurry  and upon my only saying that  he  seemed quite beside himself  and said  if i don t meet with your son at  the     coffee house myself  pray  when he comes in  tell him i shall be  highly obliged to him to call there  and then he went away  in as great  a pet as ever you saw      cecilia listened to this account with the utmost terror and misery  the  suspicions of delvile would now be aggravated  and the message he  had left for belfield  would by him be regarded as a defiance  again   however  to the     coffee house she instantly ordered the coach  an  immediate explanation from herself seeming the only possible chance for  preventing the most horrible conclusion to this unfortunate and eventful  evening     she was still accompanied by mr simkins  and  but that she attended to  nothing he said  would not inconsiderably have been tormented by his  conversation  she sent him immediately into the coffee room  to enquire  if either of the gentlemen were then in the house     he returned to her with a waiter  who said   one of them  madam  called  again just now  but he only stopt to write a note  which he left to be  given to the gentleman who came with him at first  he is but this moment  gone  and i don t think he can be at the bottom of the street       oh drive then  gallop after him    cried cecilia   coachman  go this  moment       my horses are tired   said the man   they have been out all day  and  they will gallop no further  if i don t stop and give them a drink      cecilia  too full of hope and impatience for this delay  forced open  the door herself  and without saying another word  jumped out of the  carriage  with intention to run down the street  but the coachman  immediately seizing her  protested she should not stir till he was paid     in the utmost agony of mind at an hindrance by which she imagined  delvile would be lost to her perhaps for ever  she put her hand in her  pocket  in order to give up her purse for her liberty  but mr simkins   who was making a tiresome expostulation with the coachman  took it  himself  and declaring he would not see the lady cheated  began a  tedious calculation of his fare      o pay him any thing   cried she   and let us be gone  an instant s  delay may be fatal      mr simkins  too earnest to conquer the coachman to attend to her  distress  continued his prolix harangue concerning a disputed shilling   appealing to some gathering spectators upon the justice of his cause   while his adversary  who was far from sober  still held cecilia  saying  the coach had been hired for the lady  and he would be paid by herself      good god   cried the agitated cecilia    give him my purse at  once   give him every thing he desires        the coachman  at this permission  encreased his demands  and mr simkins   taking the number of his coach  protested he would summons him to the  court of conscience the next morning  a gentleman  who then came out  of the coffee house  offered to assist the lady  but the coachman  who  still held her arm  swore he would have his right      let me go  let me pass   cried she  with encreasing eagerness and  emotion   detain me at your peril   release me this moment  only let me  run to the end of the street   good god  good heaven  detain me not for  mercy      mr simkins  humbly desiring her not to be in haste  began a formal  apology for his conduct  but the inebriety of the coachman became  evident  a mob was collecting  cecilia  breathless with vehemence and  terror  was encircled  yet struggled in vain to break away  and the  stranger gentleman  protesting  with sundry compliments  he would  himself take care of her  very freely seized her hand     this moment  for the unhappy cecilia  teemed with calamity  she was  wholly overpowered  terror for delvile  horror for herself  hurry   confusion  heat and fatigue  all assailing her at once  while all means  of repelling them were denied her  the attack was too strong for her  fears  feelings  and faculties  and her reason suddenly  yet totally  failing her  she madly called out   he will be gone  he will be gone   and i must follow him to nice      the gentleman now retreated  but mr simkins  who was talking to the mob   did not hear her  and the coachman  too much intoxicated to perceive her  rising frenzy  persisted in detaining her      i am going to france   cried she  still more wildly   why do you stop  me  he will die if i do not see him  he will bleed to death      the coachman  still unmoved  began to grow very abusive  but the  stranger  touched by compassion  gave up his attempted gallantry  and mr  simkins  much astonished  entreated her not to be frightened  she was   however  in no condition to listen to him  with a strength hitherto  unknown to her  she forcibly disengaged herself from her persecutors   yet her senses were wholly disordered  she forgot her situation  her  intention  and herself  the single idea of delvile s danger took sole  possession of her brain  though all connection with its occasion was  lost  and the moment she was released  she fervently clasped her hands   exclaiming   i will yet heal his wound  even at the hazard of my life    and springing forward  was almost instantly out of sight     mr simkins now  much alarmed  and earnestly calling after her  entered  into a compromise with the coachman  that he might attend her  but the  length of his negociation defeated its purpose  and before he was  at liberty to follow her  all trace was lost by which he might have  overtaken her  he stopt every passenger he met to make enquiries  but  though they led him on some way  they led him on in vain  and  after  a useless and ill managed pursuit  he went quietly to his own home   determining to acquaint mrs belfield with what had happened the next  morning     mean while the frantic cecilia escaped both pursuit and insult by the  velocity of her own motion  she called aloud upon delvile as she flew to  the end of the street  no delvile was there   she turned the corner   yet saw nothing of him  she still went on  though unknowing whither   the distraction of her mind every instant growing greater  from the  inflammation of fatigue  heat  and disappointment  she was spoken to  repeatedly  she was even caught once or twice by her riding habit  but  she forced herself along by her own vehement rapidity  not hearing what  was said  nor heeding what was thought  delvile  bleeding by the arm of  belfield  was the image before her eyes  and took such full possession  of her senses  that still  as she ran on  she fancied it in view  she  scarce touched the ground  she scarce felt her own motion  she seemed  as if endued with supernatural speed  gliding from place to place  from  street to street  with no consciousness of any plan  and following no  other direction than that of darting forward where ever there was most  room  and turning back when she met with any obstruction  till quite  spent and exhausted  she abruptly ran into a yet open shop  where   breathless and panting  she sunk upon the floor  and  with a look  disconsolate and helpless  sat for some time without speaking     the people of the house  concluding at first she was a woman of the  town  were going roughly to turn her out  but soon seeing their mistake   by the evident distraction of her air and manner  they enquired of some  idle people who  late as it was  had followed her  if any of them knew  who she was  or whence she came     they could give no account of her  but supposed she was broke loose from  bedlam     cecilia then  wildly starting up  exclaimed   no  no   i am not mad   i  am going to nice  to my husband       she s quite crazy   said the man of the house  who was a pawn broker    we had better get rid of her before she grows mischievous        she s somebody broke out from a private mad house  i dare say   said a  man who had followed her into the shop   and if you were to take care of  her a little while  ten to one but you ll get a reward for it       she s a gentlewoman  sure enough   said the mistress of the house    because she s got such good things on      and then  under pretence of trying to find some direction to her upon  a letter  or paper  she insisted upon searching her pockets  here   however  she was disappointed in her expectations  her purse was in the  custody of mr simkins  but neither her terror nor distress had saved her  from the daring dexterity of villainy  and her pockets  in the mob   had been rifled of whatever else they contained  the woman therefore  hesitated some time whether to take charge of her or  not  but being  urged by the man who made the proposal  and who said they might depend  upon seeing her soon advertised  as having escaped from her keepers   they ventured to undertake her     mean while she endeavoured again to get out  calling aloud upon delvile  to rescue her  but so wholly bereft of sense and recollection  she could  give no account who she was  whence she came  or whither she wished to  go     they then carried her up stairs  and attempted to make her lie down  upon a bed  but supposing she refused because it was not of straw  they  desisted  and  taking away the candle  locked the door  and all went to  rest     in this miserable condition  alone and raving  she was left to pass  the night  in the early part of it  she called upon delvile without  intermission  beseeching him to come to her defence in one moment  and  deploring his death the next  but afterwards  her strength being wholly  exhausted by these various exertions and fatigues  she threw herself  upon the floor  and lay for some minutes quite still  her head then  began to grow cooler  as the fever into which terror and immoderate  exercise had thrown her abated  and her memory recovered its functions     this was  however  only a circumstance of horror to her  she found  herself shut up in a place of confinement  without light  without  knowledge where she was  and not a human being near her     yet the same returning reason which enabled her to take this view of  her own situation  brought also to her mind that in which she had left  delvile   under all the perturbation of new kindled jealousy  just  calling upon belfield   belfield  tenacious of his honour even more than  himself   to satisfy doubts of which the very mention would be received  as a challenge      oh yet  oh yet   cried she   let me fly and overtake them   i may find  them before morning  and to night it must surely have been too late for  this work of death      she then arose to feel for the door  and succeeded  but it was locked   and no effort she could make enabled her to open it     her agony was unspeakable  she called out with violence upon the people  of the house  conjured them to set her at liberty  offered any reward  for their assistance  and threatened them with a prosecution if  detained     nobody  however  came near her  some slept on notwithstanding all the  disturbance she could make  and others  though awakened by her cries   concluded them the ravings of a mad woman  and listened not to what she  said     her head was by no means in a condition to bear this violence of  distress  every pulse was throbbing  every vein seemed bursting  her  reason  so lately returned  could not bear the repetition of such a  shock  and from supplicating for help with all the energy of feeling  and understanding  she soon continued the cry from mere vehemence of  distraction     thus dreadfully passed the night  and in the morning  when the woman of  the house came to see after her  she found her raving with such frenzy   and desperation  that her conscience was perfectly at ease in the  treatment she had given her  being now firmly satisfied she required the  strictest confinement     she still  however  tried to get away  talked of delvile without  cessation  said she should be too late to serve him  told the woman she  desired but to prevent murder  and repeatedly called out   oh beloved of  my heart  wait but a moment  and i will snatch thee from destruction      mrs wyers  this woman  now sought no longer to draw from her whence she  came  or who she was  but heard her frantic exclamations without any  emotion  contentedly concluding that her madness was incurable  and  though she was in a high fever  refused all sustenance  and had every  symptom of an alarming and dangerous malady  she was fully persuaded  that her case was that of decided insanity  and had not any notion of  temporary or accidental alienation of reason     all she could think of by way of indulgence to her  was to bring her  a quantity of straw  having heard that mad people were fond of it  and  putting it in a heap in one corner of the room  she expected to see her  eagerly fly at it     cecilia  however  distracted as she was  was eager for nothing but to  escape  which was constantly her aim  alike when violent or when quiet   mrs wyers  finding this  kept her closely confined  and the door always  locked  whether absent or present         chapter vii     an encounter     two whole days passed thus  no enquiries reached mrs wyers  and she  found in the news papers no advertisement  meanwhile cecilia grew worse  every moment  tasted neither drink nor food  raved incessantly  called  out twenty times in a breath   where is he  which way is he gone    and implored the woman by the most pathetic remonstrances  to save her  unhappy delvile   dearer to her than life  more precious than peace or  rest      at other times she talked of her marriage  of the displeasure of his  family  and of her own remorse  entreated the woman not to betray her   and promised to spend the remnant of her days in the heaviness of sorrow  and contrition     again her fancy roved  and mr monckton took sole possession of it  she  reproached him for his perfidy  she bewailed that he was massacred  she  would not a moment out live him  and wildly declared  her last remains  should moulder in his hearse   and thus  though naturally and commonly  of a silent and quiet disposition  she was now not a moment still  for  the irregular starts of a terrified and disordered imagination  were  changed into the constant ravings of morbid delirium     the woman  growing uneasy from her uncertainty of pay for her trouble   asked the advice of some of her friends what was proper for her to do   and they counselled her to put an advertisement into the papers herself  the next morning     the following  therefore  was drawn up and sent to the printer of the  daily advertiser     madness     whereas a crazy young lady  tall  fair complexioned  with blue eyes and  light hair  ran into the three blue balls  in    street  on thursday  night  the  nd instant  and has been kept there since out of charity   she was dressed in a riding habit  whoever she belongs to is desired to  send after her immediately  she has been treated with the utmost care  and tenderness  she talks much of some person by the name of delvile     n b   she had no money about her     may           this had but just been sent off  when mr wyers  the man of the house   coming up stairs  said   now we shall have two of them  for here s  the crazy old gentleman below  that says he has just heard in the  neighbourhood of what has happened to us  and he desires to see the poor  lady       it s as well let him come up  then   answered mrs wyers   for he goes  to all sort of places and people  and ten to one but he ll bustle about  till he finds out who she is      mr wyers then went down stairs to send him up     he came instantly  it was albany  who in his vagrant rambles  having  heard an unknown mad lady was at this pawn broker s  came  with his  customary eagerness to visit and serve the unhappy  to see what could be  done for her     when he entered the room  she was sitting upon the bed  her eyes  earnestly fixed upon the window  from which she was privately indulging  a wish to make her escape  her dress was in much disorder  her fine hair  was dishevelled  and the feathers of her riding hat were broken and half  falling down  some shading her face  others reaching to her shoulder      poor lady   cried albany  approaching her   how long has she been in  this state      she started at the sound of a new voice  she looked round   but what was  the astonishment of albany to see who it was   he stept back  he came  forward   he doubted his own senses   he looked at her earnestly   he  turned from her to look at the woman of the house   he cast his eyes  round the room itself  and then  lifting up his hands   o sight of woe    he cried   the generous and good  the kind reliever of distress  the  benign sustainer of misery   is  this  cecilia        cecilia  imperfectly recollecting  though not understanding him  sunk  down at his feet  tremblingly called out   oh  if he is yet to be saved   if already he is not murdered   go to him  fly after him  you will  presently overtake him  he is only in the next street  i left him there  myself  his sword drawn  and covered with human blood       sweet powers of kindness and compassion   cried the old man   look upon  this creature with pity  she who raised the depressed  she who cheared  the unhappy  she whose liberal hand turned lamentations into joy  who  never with a tearless eye could hear the voice of sorrow   is  this  she  herself   can  this  be cecilia       o do not wait to talk   cried she   go to him now  or you will never  see him more  the hand of death is on him   cold  clay cold is its  touch  he is breathing his last  oh murdered delvile  massacred husband  of my heart  groan not so piteously  fly to him  and weep over him   fly  to him and pluck the poniard from his wounded bosom       oh sounds of anguish and horror   cried the melted moralist  tears  running quick down his rugged cheeks   melancholy indeed is this  sight  humiliating to morality  such is human strength  such human  felicity   weak as our virtues  frail as our guilty natures       ah   cried she  more wildly   no one will save me now  i am married   and no one will listen to me  ill were the auspices under which i gave  my hand  oh it was a work of darkness  unacceptable and offensive  it  has been sealed  therefore  with blood  and to morrow it will be signed  with murder       poor distracted creature   exclaimed he   thy pangs i have felt  but  thy innocence i have forfeited   my own wounds bleed afresh   my own  brain threatens new frenzy        then  starting up   good woman   he added   kindly attend her   i will  seek out her friends  put her into bed  comfort  sooth  compose her   i  will come to you again  and as soon as i can      he then hurried away      oh hour of joy   cried cecilia   he is gone to rescue him  oh blissful  moment  he will yet be snatched from slaughter      the woman lost not an instant in obeying the orders she had received   she was put into bed  and nothing was neglected  as far as she had  power and thought  to give a look of decency and attention to her  accommodations     he had not left them an hour  when mary  the maid who had attended  her from suffolk  came to enquire for her lady  albany  who was now  wandering over the town in search of some of her friends  and who  entered every house where he imagined she was known  had hastened to  that of mrs hill the first of any  as he was well acquainted with her  obligations to cecilia  there  mary herself  by the directions which  her lady had given mrs belfield  had gone  and there  in the utmost  astonishment and uneasiness  had continued till albany brought news of  her     she was surprised and afflicted beyond measure  not only at the state of  her mind  and her health  but to find her in a bed and an apartment so  unsuitable to her rank of life  and so different to what she had ever  been accustomed  she wept bitterly while she enquired at the bed side  how her lady did  but wept still more  when  without answering  or  seeming to know her  cecilia started up  and called out   i must be  removed this moment  i must go to st james s square   if i stay an  instant longer  the passing bell will toll  and then how shall i be in  time for the funeral      mary  alarmed and amazed  turned hastily from her to the woman of the  house  who calmly said  the lady was only in a raving fit  and must not  be minded     extremely frightened at this intelligence  she entreated her to be quiet  and lie still  but cecilia grew suddenly so violent  that force only  could keep her from rising  and mary  unused to dispute her commands   prepared to obey them     mrs wyers now in her turn opposed in vain  cecilia was peremptory  and  mary became implicit  and  though not without much difficulty  she  was again dressed in her riding habit  this operation over  she moved  towards the door  the temporary strength of delirium giving  her a  hardiness that combated fever  illness  fatigue  and feebleness  mary   however averse and fearful  assisted her  and mrs wyers  compelled by  the obedience of her own servant  went before them to order a chair     cecilia  however  felt her weakness when she attempted to move down  stairs  her feet tottered  and her head became dizzy  she leaned it  against mary  who called aloud for more help  and made her sit down till  it came  her resolution  however  was not to be altered  a stubbornness   wholly foreign to her genuine character  now made her stern and  positive  and mary  who thought her submission indispensable  cried  but  did not offer to oppose her     mr and mrs wyers both came up to assist in supporting her  and mr wyers  offered to carry her in his arms  but she would not consent  when she  came to the bottom of the stairs  her head grew worse  she again lent  it upon mary  but mr wyers was obliged to hold them both  she still   however  was firm in her determination  and was making another effort to  proceed  when delvile rushed hastily into the shop     he had just encountered albany  who  knowing his acquaintance  though  ignorant of his marriage  with cecilia  had informed him where to seek  her     he was going to make enquiry if he was come to the right house  when  he perceived her   feeble  shaking  leaning upon one person  and half  carried by another   he started back  staggered  gasped for breath   but  finding they were proceeding  advanced with trepidation  furiously  calling out   hold  stop   what is it you are doing  monsters of savage  barbarity  are you murdering my wife      the well known voice no sooner struck the ears of cecilia  than  instantly recollecting it  she screamed  and  is suddenly endeavouring  to spring forward  fell to the ground     delvile had vehemently advanced to catch her in his arms and save her  fall  which her unexpected quickness had prevented her attendants from  doing  but the sight of her changed complection  and the wildness of her  eyes and air  again made him start   his blood froze through his veins   and he stood looking at her  cold and almost petrified     her own recollection of him seemed lost already  and exhausted by the  fatigue she had gone through in dressing and coming down stairs  she  remained still and quiet  forgetting her design of proceeding  and  forming no new one for returning     mary  to whom  as to all her fellow servants  the marriage of cecilia  had been known  before she left the country  now desired from delvile  directions what was to be done     delvile  starting suddenly at this call from the deepest horror into the  most desperate rage  fiercely exclaimed   inhuman wretches  unfeeling   execrable wretches  what is it you have done to her  how came she  hither   who brought her   who dragged her   by what infamous usage has  she been sunk into this state       indeed  sir  i don t know   cried mary      i assure you  sir   said mrs wyers   the lady        peace   cried he  furiously   i will not hear your falsehoods   peace   and begone        then  casting himself upon the ground by her side   oh my cecilia    he cried   where hast thou been thus long  how have i lost thee  what  dreadful calamity has befallen thee   answer me  my love  raise your  sweet head and answer me   oh speak   say to me any thing  the bitterest  words will be mercy to this silence         cecilia then  suddenly looking up  called out with great quickness   who  are you       who am i   cried he  amazed and affrighted      i should be glad you would go away   cried she  in a hurrying manner    for you are quite unknown to me      delvile  unconscious of her insanity  and attributing to resentment  this aversion and repulse  hastily moved from her  mournfully answering    well indeed may you disclaim me  refuse all forgiveness  load me with  hatred and reproach  and consign me to eternal anguish  i have merited  severer punishment still  i have behaved like a monster  and i am  abhorrent to myself      cecilia now  half rising  and regarding him with mingled terror and  anger  eagerly exclaimed   if you do not mean to mangle and destroy me   begone this instant       to mangle you   repeated delvile  shuddering   how horrible   but i  deserve it   look not  however  so terrified  and i will tear myself  away from you  suffer me but to assist in removing you from this place   and i will only watch you at a distance  and never see you more till you  permit me to approach you       why  why   cried cecilia  with a look of perplexity and impatience    will you not tell me your name  and where you come from       do you not know me   said he  struck with new horror   or do you only  mean to kill me by the question       do you bring me any message from mr monckton       from mr monckton   no  but he lives and will recover       i thought you had been mr monckton yourself       too cruel  yet justly cruel cecilia   is then delvile utterly  renounced   the guilty  the unhappy delvile   is he cast off for ever   have you driven him wholly from your heart  do you deny him even a place  in your remembrance       is your name  then  delvile       o what is it you mean  is it me or my name you thus disown        tis a name   cried she  sitting up   i well remember to have heard   and once i loved it  and three times i called upon it in the dead of  night  and when i was cold and wretched  i cherished it  and when i was  abandoned and left alone  i repeated it and sung to it       all gracious powers   cried delvile   her reason is utterly gone    and  hastily rising  he desperately added   what is death to this  blow   cecilia  i am content to part with thee      mary now  and mrs wyers  poured upon him eagerly an account of her  illness  and insanity  her desire of removal  and their inability to  control her     delvile  however  made no answer  he scarce heard them  the deepest  despair took possession of his mind  and  rooted to the spot where he  stood  he contemplated iii dreadful stillness the fallen and altered  object of his best hopes and affections  already in her faded cheeks  and weakened frame  his agonising terror read the quick impending  destruction of all his earthly happiness  the sight was too much for  his fortitude  and almost for his understanding  and when his woe became  utterable  he wrung his hands  and groaning aloud  called out   art thou  gone so soon  my wife  my cecilia  have i lost thee already      cecilia  with utter insensibility to what was passing  now suddenly  and  with a rapid yet continued motion  turned her head from side to side   her eyes wildly glaring  and yet apparently regarding nothing      dreadful  dreadful   exclaimed delvile   what a sight is this   and  turning from her to the people of the house  he angrily said   why is  she here upon the floor  could you not even allow her a bed  who attends  her  who waits upon her  why has nobody sent for help   don t answer  me   i will not hear you  fly this moment for a physician   bring two   bring three  bring all you can find      then  still looking from cecilia  whose sight he could no longer  support  he consulted with mary whither she should be conveyed  and  as  the night was far advanced  and no place was prepared for her elsewhere   they soon agreed that she could only be removed up stairs     delvile now attempted to carry her in his arms  but trembling and  unsteady  he had not strength to sustain her  yet not enduring to behold  the helplessness he could not assist  he conjured them to be careful  and gentle  and  committing her to their trust  ran out himself for a  physician     cecilia resisted them with her utmost power  imploring them not to bury  her alive  and averring she had received intelligence they meant to  entomb her with mr monckton     they put her  however  to bed  but her raving grew still more wild and  incessant     delvile soon returned with a physician  but had not courage to attend  him to her room  he waited for him at the foot of the stairs  where   hastily stopping him      well  sir   he cried   is it not all over  is it not impossible she can  live       she is very ill  indeed  sir   he answered   but i have given  directions which perhaps          perhaps    interrupted delvile  shuddering   do not stab me with such  a word       she is very delirious   he continued   but as her fever is very high   that is not so material  if the orders i have given take effect  and the  fever is got under  all the rest will be well of course      he then went away  leaving delvile as much thunderstruck by answers  so alarming  as if he had consulted him in full hope  and without even  suspicion of her danger     the moment he recovered from this shock  he flew out of the house for  more advice     he returned and brought with him two physicians  they confirmed the  directions already given  but would pronounce nothing decisively of her  situation     delvile  half mad with the acuteness of his misery  charged them all  with want of skill  and wrote instantly into the country for dr lyster     he went out himself in search of a messenger to ride off express  though  it was midnight  with his letter  and then  returning  he was hastening  to her room  but  while yet at the door  hearing her still raving  his  horror conquered his eagerness  and  hurrying down stairs  he spent the  remnant of the long and seemingly endless night in the shop         chapter ix     a tribute     mean while cecilia went through very severe discipline  sometimes  strongly opposing it  at other times scarce sensible what was done to  her     the whole of the next day passed in much the same manner  neither did  the next night bring any visible alteration  she had now nurses and  attendants even more than sufficient  for delvile had no relief but from  calling in more help  his terror of again seeing her encreased with his  forbearance  the interview which had already past had almost torn him  asunder  and losing all courage for attempting to enter her room  he now  spent almost all his time upon the stairs which led to it  whenever she  was still  he seated himself at her chamber door  where  if he could  hear her breathe or move  a sudden hope of her recovery gave to him a  momentary extasy that recompensed all his sufferings  but the instant  she spoke  unable to bear the sound of so loved a voice uttering nothing  but the incoherent ravings of lightheadedness  he hastened down stairs   and flying out of the house  walked in the neighbouring streets  till he  could again gather courage to enquire or to listen how she went on     the following morning  however  dr lyster came  and every hope revived   he flew to embrace him  told him instantly his marriage with cecilia   and besought him by some superior effort of his extraordinary abilities  to save him the distraction of her loss      my good friend   cried the worthy doctor   what is this you ask of me   and how can this poor young lady herself want advice more than you do   do you think these able physicians actually upon the spot  with all  the experience of full practice in london to assist their skill  want a  petty doctor out of the country to come and teach them what is right       i have more reliance upon you   cried delvile  than upon the whole  faculty  come  therefore  and prescribe for her   take some new course          impossible  my good sir  impossible  i must not lose my wits from  vanity  because you have lost yours from affliction  i could not refuse  to come to you when you wrote to me with such urgency  and i will now go  and see the young lady  as a  friend   with all my heart  i am sorry for  you at my soul  mr mortimer  she is a lovely young creature  and has an  understanding  for her years and sex  unequalled       never mention her to me   cried the impatient delvile   i cannot bear  it  go up to her  dear doctor  and if you want a consultation  send  if  you please  for every physician in town      dr lyster desired only that those who had already attended might  be summoned  and then  giving up to his entreaties the accustomed  ceremonial of waiting for them  he went to cecilia     delvile did not dare accompany him  and so well was he acquainted with  his plainness and sincerity  that though he expected his return with  eagerness  he no sooner heard him upon the stairs  than fearing to know  his opinion  he hastily snatched up his hat  and rushed vehemently out  of the house to avoid him     he continued to walk about the streets  till even the dread of ill  news was less horrible to him than this voluntary suspense  and then he  returned to the house     he found dr lyster in a small back parlour  which mrs wyers  finding she  should now be well paid  had appropriated for delvile s use     delvile  putting his hand upon the doctor s shoulder  said   well  my  dear dr lyster   you   still  i hope        i would i could make you easy   interrupted the doctor   yet  if you  are rational  one comfort  at all events  i can give you  the crisis  seems approaching  and either she will recover  or before to morrow  morning         don t go on  sir   cried delvile  with mingled rage and horror   i  will not have her days limited  i sent not for you to give me such an  account      and again he flew out of the house  leaving dr lyster unaffectedly  concerned for him  and too kind hearted and too wise to be offended at  the injustice of immoderate sorrow     in a few minutes  however  from the effect rather of despair than  philosophy  delvile grew more composed  and waited upon dr lyster to  apologize for his behaviour  he received his hearty forgiveness  and  prevailed upon him to continue in town till the whole was decided     about noon  cecilia  from the wildest rambling and most perpetual  agitation  sunk suddenly into a state of such utter insensibility   that she appeared unconscious even of her existence  and but that she  breathed  she might already have passed for being dead     when delvile heard this  he could no longer endure even his post upon  the stairs  he spent his whole time in wandering about the streets  or  stopping in dr lyster s parlour to enquire if all was over     that humane physician  not more alarmed at the danger of cecilia  than  grieved at the situation of delvile  thought the present fearful crisis  at least offered an opportunity of reconciling him with his father  he  waited  therefore  upon that gentleman in st james s square  and openly  informed him of the dangerous state of cecilia  and the misery of his  son     mr delvile  though he would gladly  to have annulled an alliance he held  disgraceful to his family  have received intelligence that cecilia was  no more  was yet extremely disconcerted to hear of sufferings to which  his own refusal of an asylum he was conscious had largely contributed   and after a haughty struggle between tenderness and wrath  he begged the  advice of dr lyster how his son might be drawn from such a scene     dr lyster  who well knew delvile was too desperate to be tractable   proposed surprising him into an interview by their returning together   mr delvile  however apprehensive and relenting  conceded most  unwillingly to a measure he held beneath him  and  when he came to the  shop  could scarce be persuaded to enter it  mortimer  at that time   was taking a solitary ramble  and dr lyster  to complete the work he  had begun of subduing the hard pride of his father  contrived  under  pretence of waiting for him  to conduct him to the room of the invalide     mr delvile  who knew not whither he was going  at first sight of the bed  and the attendants  was hastily retreating  but the changed and livid  face of cecilia caught his eye  and  struck with sudden consternation   he involuntarily stopt      look at the poor young lady   cried dr lyster   can you wonder a sight  such as this should make mr mortimer forget every thing else      she was wholly insensible  but perfectly quiet  she seemed to  distinguish nothing  and neither spoke nor moved     mr delvile regarded her with the utmost horror  the refuge he so  implacably refused her on the night when her intellects were disordered   he would now gladly have offered at the expence of almost similar  sufferings  to have relieved himself from those rising pangs which  called him author of this scene of woe  his pride  his pomp  his ancient  name  were now sunk in his estimation  and while he considered himself  the destroyer of this unhappy young creature  he would have sacrificed  them all to have called himself her protector  little is the boast of  insolence when it is analysed by the conscience  bitter is the agony  of self reproach  where misery follows hardness of heart  yet  when the  first painful astonishment from her situation abated  the remorse she  excited being far stronger than the pity  he gave an angry glance at dr  lyster for betraying him into such a sight  and hastily left the room     delvile  who was now impatiently waiting to see dr lyster in the little  parlour  alarmed at the sound of a new step upon the stairs  came out to  enquire who had been admitted  when he saw his father  he shrunk back   but mr delvile  no longer supported by pride  and unable to recover from  the shock he had just received  caught him in his arms  and said  oh  come home to me  my son  this is a place to destroy you       ah  sir   cried delvile   think not of me now   you must shew me no  kindness  i am not in a state to bear it   and  forcibly breaking from  him  he hurried out of the house     mr delvile  all the father awakened in his bosom  saw his departure  with more dread than anger  and returned himself to st james s square   tortured with parental fears  and stung by personal remorse  lamenting  his own inflexibility  and pursued by the pale image of cecilia     she was still in this unconscious state  and apparently as free from  suffering as from enjoyment  when a new voice was suddenly heard  without  exclaiming   oh where is she  where is she  where is my dear  miss beverley   and henrietta belfield ran wildly into the room     the advertisement in the news papers had at once brought her to town   and directed her to the house  the mention that the lost lady  talked  much of a person by the name of delvile   struck her instantly to mean  cecilia  the description corresponded with this idea  and the account of  the dress confirmed it  mr arnott  equally terrified with herself  had  therefore lent her his chaise to learn the truth of this conjecture  and  she had travelled all night     flying up to the bedside   who is this   she cried   this is not miss  beverley   and then screaming with unrestrained horror   oh mercy   mercy   she called out   yes  it is indeed  and nobody would know  her   her own mother would not think her her child       you must come away  miss belfield   said mary   you must indeed   the  doctors all say my lady must not be disturbed       who shall take me away   cried she  angrily   nobody mary  not all the  doctors in the world  oh sweet miss beverley  i will lie down by your  side   i will never quit you while you live   and i wish  i wish i could  die to save your precious life      then  leaning over her  and wringing her hands   oh i shall break my  heart   she cried   to see her in this condition  is this the so happy  miss beverley  that i thought every body born to give joy to  the  miss beverley that seemed queen of the whole world  yet so good and so  gentle  so kind to the meanest person  excusing every body s faults but  her own  and telling them how they might mend  and trying to make them  as good as herself   oh who would know her  who would know her  what  have they done to you  my beloved miss beverley  how have they altered  and disfigured you in this wicked and barbarous manner      in the midst of this simple yet pathetic testimony  to the worth and  various excellencies of cecilia  dr lyster came into the room  the women  all flocked around him  except mary  to vindicate themselves from any  share in permitting this new comer s entrance and behaviour  but mary  only told him who she was  and said  that if her lady was well enough to  know her  there was nobody she was certain she would have been so glad  to see      young lady   said the doctor   i would advise you to walk into another  room till you are a little more composed       every body  i find  is for hurrying me away   cried the sobbing  henrietta  whose honest heart swelled with its own affectionate  integrity   but they might all save themselves the trouble  for go i  will not       this is very wrong   said the doctor   and must not be suffered  do you  call it friendship to come about a sick person in this manner       oh my miss beverley   cried henrietta   do you hear how they all  upbraid me  how they all want to force me away from you  and to hinder  me even from looking at you  speak for me  sweet lady  speak for me  yourself  tell them the poor henrietta will not do you any harm  tell  them she only wishes just to sit by you  and to see you   i will hold by  this dear hand   i will cling to it till the last minute  and you will  not  i know you will not  give orders to have it taken away from me      dr lyster  though his own good nature was much affected by this fond  sorrow  now half angrily represented to her the impropriety of indulging  it  but henrietta  unused to disguise or repress her feelings  grew only  the more violent  the more she was convinced of cecilia s danger   oh  look but at her   she exclaimed   and take me from her if you can   see how her sweet eyes are fixed  look but what a change in her  complexion   she does not see me  she does not know me   she does not  hear me  her hand seems quite lifeless already  her face is all fallen  away   oh that i had died twenty deaths before i had lived to see this  sight   poor wretched henrietta  thou bast now no friend left in the  world  thou mayst go and lie down in some corner  and no one will come  and say to thee a word of comfort       this must not be   said dr lyster   you must take her away       you shall not   cried she  desperately   i will stay with her till she  has breathed her last  and i will stay with her still longer  and if she  was to speak to you this moment  she would tell you that she chose it   she loved the poor henrietta  and loved to have her near her  and when  she was ill  and in much distress  she never once bid me leave her room   is it not true  my sweet miss beverley  do you not know it to be true   oh look not so dreadfully  turn to your unhappy henrietta  sweetest   best of ladies  will you not speak to her once more  will you not say to  her one single word      dr lyster now grew very angry  and telling her such violence might have  fatal consequences  frightened her into more order  and drew her away  himself  he had then the kindness to go with her into another room   where  when her first vehemence was spent  his remonstrances and  reasoning brought her to a sense of the danger she might occasion  and  made her promise not to return to the room till she had gained strength  to behave better     when dr lyster went again to delvile  he found him greatly alarmed  by his long stay  he communicated to him briefly what had passed  and  counselled him to avoid encreasing his own grief by the sight of  what was suffered by this unguarded and ardent girl  delvile readily  assented  for the weight of his own woe was too heavy to bear any  addition     henrietta now  kept in order by dr lyster  contented herself with only  sitting on the bed  without attempting to speak  and with no other  employment than alternately looking at her sick friend  and covering  her streaming eyes with her handkerchief  from time to time quitting the  room wholly  for the relief of sobbing at liberty and aloud in another     but  in the evening  while delvile and dr lyster were taking one of  their melancholy rambles  a new scene was acted in the apartment of  the still senseless cecilia  albany suddenly made his entrance into it   accompanied by three children  two girls and one boy  from the ages of  four to six  neatly dressed  clean  and healthy      see here    cried he  as he came in   see here what i ve brought  you  raise  raise your languid head  and look this way  you think me  rigid   an enemy to pleasure  austere  harsh  and a forbidder of joy   look at this sight  and see the contrary  who shall bring you comfort   joy  pleasure  like this  three innocent children  clothed and fed by  your bounty      henrietta and mary  who both knew him well  were but little surprised at  anything he said or did  and the nurses presumed not to interfere but by  whispers     cecilia  however  observed nothing that passed  and albany  somewhat  astonished  approached nearer to the bed   wilt thou not speak   he  cried      she can t  sir   said one of the women   she has been speechless many  hours      the air of triumph with which he had entered the room was now changed  into disappointment and consternation  for some minutes he thoughtfully  and sorrowfully contemplated her  and then  with a deep sigh  said   how  will the poor rue this day   then  turning to the children  who  awed by  this scene  were quiet from terror   alas   he said   ye helpless babes   ye know not what you have lost  presumptuously we came  unheeded we must  return  i brought you to be seen by your benefactress  but she is going  where she will find many such      he then led them away  but  suddenly coming back   i may see her   perhaps  no more  shall i not  then  pray for her  great and aweful is  the change she is making  what are human revolutions  how pitiful  how  insignificant  compared with it   come  little babies  come  with gifts  has she often blessed  you   with wishes bless  her   come  let us kneel  round her bed  let us all pray for her together  lift up your innocent  hands  and for all of you i will speak      he then made the children obey his injunctions  and having knelt  himself  while henrietta and mary instantly did the same   sweet  flower   he cried   untimely cropt in years  yet in excellence mature   early decayed in misery  yet fragrant in innocence  gentle be thy exit   for unsullied have been thy days  brief be thy pains  for few have been  thy offences  look at her sweet babes  and bear her in your remembrance   often will i visit you and revive the solemn scene  look at her ye   also  who are nearer to your end  ah  will you bear it like her      he paused  and the nurses and mrs wyers  struck by this call  and moved  by the general example  crept to the bed  and dropt on their knees   almost involuntarily      she departs   resumed albany   the envy of the world  while yet no  guilt had seized her soul  and no remorse had marred her peace  she was  the hand maid of charity  and pity dwelt in her bosom  her mouth  was never open but to give comfort  her foot steps were followed by  blessings  oh happy in purity  be thine the song of triumph   softly  shalt thou sink to temporary sleep   sublimely shalt thou rise to life  that wakes for ever      he then got up  took the children by their little hands  and went away         chapter x     a termination     dr lyster and delvile met them at the entrance into the house  extremely  alarmed lest cecilia had received any disturbance  they both hastened  up stairs  but delvile proceeded only to the door  he stopt there and  listened  but all was silent  the prayers of albany had struck an awe  into every one  and dr lyster soon returned to tell him there was no  alteration in his patient      and he has not disturbed her   cried delvile      no  not at all       i think  then   said he  advancing  though trembling   i will yet see  her once more       no  no  mr mortimer   cried the doctor   why should you give yourself  so unnecessary a shock       the shock   answered he   is over   tell me  however  is there any  chance i may hurt  her        i believe not  i do not think  just now  she will perceive you       well  then   i may grieve  perhaps  hereafter  that once more  that  one glance    he stopt  irresolute the doctor would again have dissuaded  him  but  after a little hesitation  he assured him he was prepared for  the worst  and forced himself into the room     when again  however  he beheld cecilia   senseless  speechless   motionless  her features void of all expression  her cheeks without  colour  her eyes without meaning   he shrunk from the sight  he leant  upon dr lyster  and almost groaned aloud     the doctor would have conducted him out of the apartment  but   recovering from this first agony  he turned again to view her  and  casting up his eyes  fervently ejaculated   oh merciful powers  take   or destroy her  let her not linger thus  rather let me lose her  for ever   o far rather would i see her dead  glad in this dreadful  condition      then  advancing to the bed side  and yet more earnestly looking at her    i pray not now   he cried   for thy life  inhumanly as i have treated  thee  i am not yet so hardened as to wish thy misery lengthened no   quick be thy restoration  or short as pure thy passage to eternity   oh  my cecilia  lovely  however altered  sweet even in the arms of death and  insanity  and dearer to my tortured heart in this calamitous state  than  in all thy pride of health and beauty        he stopt  and turned from her  yet could not tear himself away  he came  back  he again looked at her  he hung over her in anguish unutterable   he kissed each burning hand  he folded to his bosom her feeble form   and  recovering his speech  though almost bursting with sorrow  faintly  articulated   is all over  no ray of reason left  no knowledge of thy  wretched delvile   no  none  the hand of death is on her  and she  is utterly gone   sweet suffering excellence  loved  lost  expiring  cecilia   but i will not repine  peace and kindred angels are watching  to receive thee  and if thou art parted from thyself  it were impious  to lament thou shouldst be parted from me   yet in thy tomb will be  deposited all that to me could render existence supportable  every  frail chance of happiness  every sustaining hope  and all alleviation of  sorrow        dr lyster now again approaching  thought he perceived some change in  his patient  and peremptorily forced him away from her  then returning  himself  he found that her eyes were shut  and she was dropt asleep     this was an omen the most favourable he could hope  he now seated  himself by the bedside  and determined not to quit her till the expected  crisis was past  he gave the strictest orders for the whole house to be  kept quiet  and suffered no one in the room either to speak or move     her sleep was long and heavy  yet  when she awoke  her sensibility  was evidently returned  she started  suddenly raised her head from the  pillow  looked round her  and called out   where am i now       thank heaven   cried henrietta  and was rushing forward  when dr  lyster  by a stern and angry look  compelled her again to take her seat     he then spoke to her himself  enquired how she did  and found her quite  rational     henrietta  who now doubted not her perfect recovery  wept as violently  for joy as she had before wept for grief  and mary  in the same belief   ran instantly to delvile  eager to carry to him the first tidings that  her mistress had recovered her reason     delvile  in the utmost emotion  then returned to the chamber  but  stood at some distance from the bed  waiting dr lyster s permission to  approach it     cecilia was quiet and composed  her recollection seemed restored   and her intellects sound  hut she was faint and weak  and contentedly  silent  to avoid the effort of speaking     dr lyster encouraged this stillness  and suffered not anyone  not even  delvile  to advance to her  after a short time  however  she again  and  very calmly  began to talk to him  she now first knew him  and seemed  much surprised by his attendance  she could not tell  she said  what  of late had happened to her  nor could guess where she was  or by what  means she came into such a place  dr lyster desired her at present  not to think upon the subject  and promised her a full account of  everything  when she was stronger  and more fit for conversing     this for a while silenced her  but  after a short pause   tell me   she  said   dr lyster  have i no friend in this place but you       yes  yes  you have several friends here   answered the doctor   only i  keep them in order  lest they should hurry or disturb you      she seemed much pleased by this speech  but soon after said   you must  not  doctor  keep them in order much longer  for the sight of them  i  think  would much revive me       ah  miss beverley   cried henrietta  who could not now restrain  herself   may not  i   among the rest  come and speak to you       who is that   said cecilia  in a voice of pleasure  though very feeble    is it my ever dear henrietta       oh this is joy indeed   cried she  fervently kissing her cheeks and  forehead   joy that i never  never expected to have more       come  come   cried dr lyster   here s enough of this  did i not do well  to keep such people off       i believe you did   said cecilia  faintly smiling   my too kind  henrietta  you must be more tranquil       i will  i will indeed  madam   my dear  dear miss beverley  i will  indeed   now once you have owned me  and once again i hear your sweet  voice  i will do any thing  and every thing  for i am made happy for my  whole life       ah  sweet henrietta   cried cecilia  giving her her hand   you must  suppress these feelings  or our doctor here will soon part us  but tell  me  doctor  is there no one else that you can let me see      delvile  who had listened to this scene in the unspeakable perturbation  of that hope which is kindled from the very ashes of despair  was now  springing forward  but dr lyster  fearful of the consequences  hastily  arose  and with a look and air not to be disputed  took hold of his arm   and led him out of the room  he then represented to him strongly the  danger of agitating or disturbing her  and charged him to keep from her  sight till better able to bear it  assuring him at the same time that he  might now reasonably hope her recovery     delvile  lost in transport  could make no answer  but flew into his  arms  and almost madly embraced him  he then hastened out of sight to  pour forth fervent thanks  and hurrying back with equal speed  again  embraced the doctor  and while his manly cheeks were burnt with tears of  joy  he could not yet articulate the glad tumult of his soul     the worthy dr lyster  who heartily partook of his happiness  again urged  him to be discreet  and delvile  no longer intractable and desperate   gratefully concurred in whatever he commanded  dr lyster then returned  to cecilia  and to relieve her mind from any uneasy suspense  talked to  her openly of delvile  gave her to understand he was acquainted with  her marriage  and told her he had prohibited their meeting till each was  better able to support it     cecilia by this delay seemed half gratified  and half disappointed   but the rest of the physicians  who had been summoned upon this happy  change  now appearing  the orders were yet more strictly enforced for  keeping her quiet     she submitted  therefore  peaceably  and delvile  whose gladdened heart  still throbbed with speechless rapture  contentedly watched at her  chamber door  and obeyed implicitly whatever was said to him     she now visibly  and almost hourly grew better  and  in a short time   her anxiety to know all that was passed  and by what means she became so  ill  and confined in a house of which she had not any knowledge  obliged  dr lyster to make himself master of these particulars  that he might  communicate them to her with a calmness that delvile could not attain     delvile himself  happy to be spared the bitter task of such a relation   informed him all he knew of the story  and then entreated him to narrate  to her also the motives of his own strange  and he feared unpardonable  conduct  and the scenes which had followed their parting     he came  he said  to england  ignorant of all that had past in his  absence  intending merely to wait upon his father  and communicate his  marriage  before he gave directions to his lawyer for the settlements  and preparations which were to precede its further publication  he  meant  also  to satisfy himself  of the real situation of mr monckton   and then  after an interview with cecilia  to have returned to his  mother  and waited at nice till he might publicly claim his wife     to this purpose he had written in his letter  which he meant to have put  in the post office in london himself  and he had but just alighted from  his chaise  when he met ralph  cecilia s servant  in the street     hastily stopping him  he enquired if he had left his place   no    answered ralph   i am only come up to town with my lady       with your lady   cried the astonished delvile  is your lady then in  town       yes  sir  she is at mrs belfield s       at mrs belfield s   is her daughter returned home      no  sir  we left her in the country      he was then going on with a further account  but  in too much confusion  of mind to hear him delvile abruptly wished him good night  and marched  on himself towards belfield s     the pleasure with which he would have heard that cecilia was so near to  him  was totally lost in his perplexity to account for her journey  her  letters had never hinted at such a purpose   the news reached him  only by accident   it was ten o clock at night   yet she was at  belfield s  though the sister was away   though the mother was  professedly odious to her   in an instant  all he had formerly heard   all he had formerly disregarded  rushed suddenly upon his memory  and  he began to believe he had been deluded  that his father was right  and  that belfield had some strange and improper influence over her heart     the suspicion was death to him  he drove it from him  he concluded  the whole was some error  his reason as powerfully as his tenderness  vindicated her innocence  and though he arrived at the house in much  disorder  he yet arrived with a firm persuasion of an honourable  explanation     the door was open   a chaise was at it in waiting   mrs belfield was  listening in the passage  these appearances were strange  and encreased  his agitation  he asked for her son in a voice scarce audible   she told  him he was engaged with a lady  and must not be disturbed     that fatal answer  at a moment so big with the most horrible surmises   was decisive  furiously  therefore  he forced himself past her  and  opened the door   but when he saw them together   the rest of the family  confessedly excluded  his rage turned to horror  and he could hardly  support himself      o dr lyster   he continued   ask of the sweet creature if these  circumstances offer any extenuation for the fatal jealousy which seized  me  never by myself while i live will it be forgiven  but she  perhaps   who is all softness  all compassion  and all peace  may some time hence  think my sufferings almost equal to my offence      he then proceeded in his narration     when he had so peremptorily ordered her chaise to st james s square  he  went back to the house  and desired belfield to walk out with him  he  complied  and they were both silent till they came to a coffee house   where they asked for a private room  the whole way they went  his heart   secretly satisfied of the purity of cecilia  smote him for the situation  in which he had left her  yet  having unfortunately gone so far as to  make his suspicions apparent  he thought it necessary to his character  that their abolition should be equally public     when they were alone   belfield   he said   to obviate any imputation of  impertinence in my enquiries  i deny not  what i presume you have been  told by herself  that i have the nearest interest in whatever concerns  the lady from whom we are just now parted  i must beg  therefore  an  explicit account of the purpose of your private conversation with her       mr delvile   answered belfield  with mingled candour and spirit   i am  not commonly much disposed to answer enquiries thus cavalierly put to  me  yet here  as i find myself not the principal person concerned  i  think i am bound in justice to speak for the absent who is  i assure  you  therefore  most solemnly  that your interest in miss beverley i  never heard but by common report  that our being alone together was by  both of us undesigned and undesired  that the honour she did our house  in calling at it  was merely to acquaint my mother with my sister s  removal to mrs harrel s  and that the part which i had myself in her  condescension  was simply to be consulted upon a journey which she has  in contemplation to the south of france  and now  sir  having given you  this peaceable satisfaction  you will find me extremely at your service  to offer any other      delvile instantly held out his hand to him   what you assert   he said    upon your honour  requires no other testimony  your gallantry and  your probity are equally well known to me  with either  therefore  i am  content  and by no means require the intervention of both      they then parted  and now  his doubts removed  and his punctilio  satisfied  he flew to st james s square  to entreat the forgiveness of  cecilia for the alarm he had occasioned her  and to hear the reason of  her sudden journey  and change of measures  but when he came there  to  find that his father  whom he had concluded was at delvile castle   was in the house  while cecilia had not even enquired for him at the  door    oh let me not   he continued   even to myself  let me not trace  the agony of that moment   where to seek her i knew not  why she was in  london i could not divine  for what purpose she had given the postilion  a new direction i could form no idea  yet it appeared that she wished to  avoid me  and once more  in the frenzy of my disappointment  i supposed  belfield a party in her concealment  again  therefore  i sought him   at  his own house   at the coffee house where i had left him   in vain   wherever i came  i just missed him  for  hearing of my search  he went  with equal restlessness  from place to place to meet me  i rejoice we  both failed  a repetition of my enquiries in my then irritable state   must inevitably have provoked the most fatal resentment      i will not dwell upon the scenes that followed   my laborious search   my fruitless wanderings  the distraction of my suspense  the excess of  my despair   even belfield  the fiery belfield  when i met with him the  next day  was so much touched by my wretchedness  that he bore with  all my injustice  feeling  noble young man  never will i lose the  remembrance of his high souled patience      and now  dr lyster  go to my cecilia  tell her this tale  and try   for you have skill sufficient  to soften  yet not wound her with my  sufferings  if then she can bear to see me  to bless me with the sound  of her sweet voice  no longer at war with her intellects  to hold out  to me her loved hand  in token of peace and forgiveness   oh  dr lyster   preserver of  my  life in hers  give to me but that exquisite moment   and every past evil will be for ever obliterated       you must be calmer  sir   said the doctor   before i make the attempt   these heroicks are mighty well for sound health  and strong nerves  but  they will not do for an invalide      he went  however  to cecilia  and gave her this narration  suppressing  whatever he feared would most affect her  and judiciously enlivening the  whole by his strictures  cecilia was much easier for this removal of her  perplexities  and  as her anguish and her terror had been unmixed with  resentment  she had now no desire but to reconcile delvile with himself     dr lyster  however  by his friendly authority  obliged her for some  time to be content with this relation  but when she grew better  her  impatience became stronger  and he feared opposition would be as hurtful  as compliance     delvile  therefore  was now admitted  yet slowly and with trepidation he  advanced  terrified for her  and fearful of himself  filled with remorse  for the injuries she had sustained  and impressed with grief and horror  to behold her so ill and altered     supported by pillows  she sat almost upright  the moment she saw him   she attempted to bend forward and welcome him  calling out in a tone of  pleasure  though faintly   ah  dearest delvile  is it you   but too  weak for the effort she had made  she sunk back upon her pillow  pale   trembling  and disordered     dr lyster would then have interfered to postpone their further  conversation  but delvile was no longer master of himself or his  passions  he darted forward  and kneeling at the bed side   sweet  injured excellence   he cried   wife of my heart  sole object of my  chosen affection  dost thou yet live  do i hear thy loved voice   do i  see thee again   art thou my cecilia  and have i indeed not lost thee    then regarding her more fixedly   alas   he cried   art thou indeed my  cecilia  so pale  so emaciated   oh suffering angel  and couldst thou  then call upon delvile  the guilty  but heart broken delvile  thy  destroyer  thy murderer  and yet not call to execrate him      cecilia  extremely affected  could not utter a word  she held out to  him her hand  she looked at him with gentleness and kindness  but tears  started into her eyes  and trickled in large drops down her colourless  cheeks      angelic creature   cried delvile  his own tears overflowing  while he  pressed to his lips the kind token of her pardon   can you give to me  again a hand so ill deserved  can you look with such compassion on the  author of your woes  on the wretch  who for an instant could doubt the  purity of a mind so seraphic       ah  delvile   cried she  a little reviving   think no more of what is  past   to see you   to be yours   drives all evil from my remembrance       i am not worthy this joy   cried he  rising  kneeling  and rising  again   i know not how to sustain it  a forgiveness such as this   when  i believed you must hate me for ever  when repulse and aversion were  all i dared expect   when my own inhumanity had bereft thee of thy  reason   when the grave  the pitiless grave  was already open to receive  thee         too kind  too feeling delvile   cried the penetrated cecilia   relieve  your loaded heart from these bitter recollections  mine is lightened  already   lightened  i think  of every thing but its affection for   you        oh words of transport and extacy   cried the enraptured delvile   oh  partner of my life  friend  solace  darling of my bosom  that so lately  i thought expiring  that i folded to my bleeding heart in the agony of  eternal separation         come away  sir  come away   cried dr lyster  who now saw that cecilia  was greatly agitated   i will not be answerable for the continuation of  this scene   and taking him by the arm  he awakened him from his frantic  rapture  by assuring him she would faint  and forced him away from her     soon after he was gone  and cecilia became more tranquil  henrietta   who had wept with bitterness in a corner of the room during this scene   approached her  and  with an attempted smile  though in a voice hardly  audible  said   ah  miss beverley  you will  at last  then be happy   happy as all your goodness deserves  and i am sure i should rejoice in  it if i was to die to make you happier      cecilia  who but too well knew her full meaning  tenderly embraced her   but was prevented by dr lyster from entering into any discourse with  her     the first meeting  however  with delvile being over  the second was  far more quiet  and in a very short time  he would scarcely quit her a  moment  cecilia herself receiving from his sight a pleasure too great  for denial  yet too serene for danger     the worthy dr lyster  finding her prospect of recovery thus fair   prepared for leaving london  but  equally desirous to do good out of his  profession as in it  he first  at the request of delvile  waited upon  his father  to acquaint him with his present situation  solicit his  directions for his future proceedings  and endeavour to negociate a  general reconciliation     mr delvile  to whose proud heart social joy could find no avenue  was  yet touched most sensibly by the restoration of cecilia  neither his  dignity nor his displeasure had been able to repress remorse  a feeling  to which  with all his foibles  he had not been accustomed  the view of  her distraction had dwelt upon his imagination  the despondency of his  son had struck him with fear and horror  he had been haunted by self  reproach  and pursued by vain regret  and those concessions he had  refused to tenderness and entreaty  he now willingly accorded to change  repentance for tranquility  he sent instantly for his son  whom even  with tears he embraced  and felt his own peace restored as he pronounced  his forgiveness     new  however  to kindness  he retained it not long  and a stranger to  generosity  he knew not how to make her welcome  the extinction of his  remorse abated his compassion for cecilia  and when solicited to receive  her  he revived the charges of mr monckton     cecilia  informed of this  determined to write to that gentleman  herself  whose long and painful illness  joined to his irrecoverable  loss of her  she now hoped might prevail with him to make reparation for  the injuries he had done her      to mr monckton      i write not  sir  to upbraid you  the woes which have followed your ill  offices  and which you may some time hear  will render my reproaches  superfluous  i write but to beseech that what is past may content you   and that  however  while i was single  you chose to misrepresent me to  the delvile family  you will have so much honour  since i am now become  one of it  as to acknowledge my innocence of the crimes laid to my  charge     in remembrance of my former long friendship  i send you my good wishes   and in consideration of my hopes from your recantation  i send you  sir   if you think it worth acceptance  my forgiveness     cecilia delvile     mr monckton  after many long and painful struggles between useless rage   and involuntary remorse  at length sent the following answer      to mrs mortimer delvile      those who could ever believe you guilty  must have been eager to think  you so  i meant but your welfare at all times  and to have saved you  from a connection i never thought equal to your merit  i am grieved   but not surprised  to hear of your injuries  from the alliance you  have formed  nothing else could be expected  if my testimony to your  innocence can  however  serve to mitigate them  i scruple not to declare  i believe it without taint                  delvile sent by dr lyster this letter to his father  whose rage at the  detection of the perfidy which had deceived him  was yet inferior to  what he felt that his family was mentioned so injuriously     his conference with dr lyster was long and painful  but decisive  that  sagacious and friendly man knew well how to work upon  his passions   and so effectually awakened them by representing the disgrace of his own  family from the present situation of cecilia  that before he quitted his  house he was authorised to invite her to remove to it     when he returned from his embassy  he found delvile in her room  and  each waiting with impatience the event of his negociation     the doctor with much alacrity gave cecilia the invitation with which he  had been charged  but delvile  jealous for her dignity  was angry and  dissatisfied his father brought it not himself  and exclaimed with much  mortification   is this all the grace accorded me       patience  patience  sir   answered the doctor   when you have thwarted  any body in their first hope and ambition  do you expect they will send  you their compliments and many thanks for the disappointment  pray let  the good gentleman have his way in some little matters  since you have  taken such effectual care to put out of his reach the power of having it  in greater       o far from starting obstacles   cried cecilia   let us solicit a  reconciliation with whatever concessions he may require  the misery of  disobedience we have but too fatally experienced  and thinking as we  think of filial ties and parental claims  how can we ever hope happiness  till forgiven and taken into favour       true  my cecilia   answered delvile   and generous and condescending  as true  and if  you  can thus sweetly comply  i will gratefully forbear  making any opposition  too much already have you suffered from the  impetuosity of my temper  but i will try to curb it in future by the  remembrance of your injuries       the whole of this unfortunate business   said dr lyster   has been the  result of pride and prejudice  your uncle  the dean  began it  by his  arbitrary will  as if an ordinance of his own could arrest the course of  nature  and as if  he  had power to keep alive  by the loan of a name   a family in the male branch already extinct  your father  mr mortimer   continued it with the same self partiality  preferring the wretched  gratification of tickling his ear with a favourite sound  to the solid  happiness of his son with a rich and deserving wife  yet this   however  remember  if to pride and prejudice you owe your miseries  so  wonderfully is good and evil balanced  that to pride and prejudice you  will also owe their termination  for all that i could say to mr delvile   either of reasoning or entreaty   and i said all i could suggest  and i  suggested all a man need wish to hear   was totally thrown away  till  i pointed out to him his  own  disgrace  in having a  daughter in law   immured in these mean lodgings      thus  my dear young lady  the terror which drove you to this house  and  the sufferings which have confined you in it  will prove  in the event   the source of your future peace  for when all my best rhetorick failed  to melt mr delvile  i instantly brought him to terms by coupling his  name with a pawnbroker s  and he could not with more disgust hear his  son called mr beverley  than think of his son s wife when he hears of  the  three blue balls   thus the same passions  taking but different  directions   do  mischief and  cure  it alternately      such  my good young friends  is the moral of your calamities  you have  all  in my opinion  been strangely at cross purposes  and trifled  no  one knows why  with the first blessings of life  my only hope is that  now  having among you thrown away its luxuries  you will have known  enough of misery to be glad to keep its necessaries      this excellent man was yet prevailed upon by delvile to stay and assist  in removing the feeble cecilia to st james s square     henrietta  for whom mr arnott s equipage and servants had still remained  in town  was then  though with much difficulty  persuaded to go back to  suffolk  but cecilia  however fond of her society  was too sensible of  the danger and impropriety of her present situation  to receive from it  any pleasure     mr delvile s reception of cecilia was formal and cold  yet  as she now  appeared publicly in the character of his son s wife  the best  apartment in his house had been prepared for her use  his domestics were  instructed to wait upon her with the utmost respect  and lady honoria  pemberton  who was accidentally in town  offered from curiosity  what  mr delvile accepted from parade  to be herself in st james s square  in  order to do honour to his daughter in law s first entrance     when cecilia was a little recovered from the shock of the first  interview  and the fatigue of her removal  the anxious mortimer would  instantly have had her conveyed to her own apartment  but  willing to  exert herself  and hoping to oblige mr delvile  she declared she was  well able to remain some time longer in the drawing room      my good friends   said dr lyster   in the course of my long practice   i have found it impossible to study the human frame  without a little  studying the human mind  and from all that i have yet been able to make  out  either by observation  reflection  or comparison  it appears to me  at this moment  that mr mortimer delvile has got the best wife  and that  you  sir  have here the most faultless daughter in law  that any husband  or any father in the three kingdoms belonging to his majesty can either  have or desire      cecilia smiled  mortimer looked his delighted concurrence  mr delvile  forced himself to make a stiff inclination of the head  and lady honoria  gaily exclaimed   dr lyster  when you say the  best  and the most   faultless   you should always add the rest of the company excepted       upon my word   cried the doctor   i beg your ladyship s pardon  but  there is a certain unguarded warmth comes across a man now and then   that drives  etiquette  out of his head  and makes him speak truth  before he well knows where he is       o terrible   cried she   this is sinking deeper and deeper  i had hoped  the town air would have taught you better things  but i find you have  visited at delvile castle till you are fit for no other place       whoever  lady honoria   said mr delvile  much offended   is fit for  delvile castle  must be fit for every other place  though every other  place may by no means be fit for him       o yes  sir   cried she  giddily   every possible place will be fit for  him  if he can once bear with that  don t you think so  dr lyster       why  when a man has the honour to see your ladyship   answered he   good humouredly   he is apt to think too much of the person  to care  about the place       come  i begin to have some hopes of you   cried she   for i see  for a  doctor  you have really a very pretty notion of a compliment  only you  have one great fault still  you look the whole time as if you said it  for a joke       why  in fact  madam  when a man has been a plain dealer both in  word and look for upwards of fifty years   tis expecting too quick a  reformation to demand ductility of voice and eye from him at a blow   however  give me but a little time and a little encouragement  and  with  such a tutress   twill be hard if i do not  in a very few lessons   learn the right method of seasoning a simper  and the newest fashion of  twisting words from meaning       but pray   cried she   upon those occasions  always remember to look  serious  nothing sets off a compliment so much as a long face  if you  are tempted to an unseasonable laugh  think of delvile castle   tis an  expedient i commonly make use of myself when i am afraid of being too  frisky  and it always succeeds  for the very recollection of it gives me  the head ache in a moment  upon my word  mr delvile  you must have the  constitution of five men  to have kept such good health  after living so  long at that horrible place  you can t imagine how you ve surprised me   for i have regularly expected to hear of your death at the end of every  summer  and  i assure you  once  i was very near buying mourning       the estate which descends to a man from his own ancestors  lady  honoria   answered mr delvile   will seldom be apt to injure his health   if he is conscious of committing no misdemeanour which has degraded  their memory       how vastly odious this new father of yours is   said lady honoria  in a  whisper to cecilia   what could ever induce you to give up your charming  estate for the sake of coming into this fusty old family  i would really  advise you to have your marriage annulled  you have only  you know  to  take an oath that you were forcibly run away with  and as you are  an heiress  and the delviles are all so violent  it will easily be  credited  and then  as soon as you are at liberty  i would advise you to  marry my little lord derford       would you only  then   said cecilia   have me regain my freedom in  order to part with it       certainly   answered lady honoria   for you can do nothing at all  without being married  a single woman is a thousand times more shackled  than a wife  for she is accountable to every body  and a wife  you know   has nothing to do but just to manage her husband       and that   said cecilia  smiling   you consider as a trifle       yes  if you do but marry a man you don t care for       you are right  then  indeed  to recommend to me my lord derford       o yes  he will make the prettiest husband in the world  you may fly  about yourself as wild as a lark  and keep him the whole time as tame as  a jack daw  and though he may complain of you to your friends  he will  never have the courage to find fault to your face  but as to mortimer   you will not be able to govern him as long as you live  for the moment  you have put him upon the fret  you ll fall into the dumps yourself   hold out your hand to him  and  losing the opportunity of gaining some  material point  make up at the first soft word       you think  then  the quarrel more amusing than the reconciliation       o  a thousand times  for while you are quarrelling  you may say any  thing  and demand any thing  but when you are reconciled  you ought to  behave pretty  and seem contented       those who presume to have any pretensions to your ladyship   said  cecilia   would be made happy indeed should they hear your principles       o  it would not signify at all   answered she   for one s fathers  and  uncles  and those sort of people  always make connexions for one  and  not a creature thinks of our principles  till they find them out by our  conduct  and nobody can possibly do that till we are married  for they  give us no power beforehand  the men know nothing of us in the world  while we are single  but how we can dance a minuet  or play a lesson  upon the harpsichord       and what else   said mr delvile  who advanced  and heard this last  speech   need a young lady of rank desire to be known for  your ladyship  surely would not have her degrade herself by studying like an artist or  professor       o no  sir  i would not have her study at all  it s mighty well for  children  but really after sixteen  and when one is come out  one  has quite fatigue enough in dressing  and going to public places   and ordering new things  without all that torment of first and second  position  and e upon the first line  and f upon the first  space       your ladyship must  however  pardon me for hinting   said mr delvile    that a young lady of condition  who has a proper sense of her dignity   cannot be seen too rarely  or known too little       o but i hate dignity   cried she carelessly   for it s the dullest  thing in the world  i always thought it was owing to that you were so  little amusing   really i beg your pardon  sir  i meant to say so little  talkative       i can easily credit that your ladyship spoke hastily   answered he   highly piqued   for i believe  indeed  a person of a family such as  mine  will hardly be supposed to have come into the world for the office  of amusing it       o no  sir   cried she  with pretended innocence   nobody  i am sure   ever saw you with such a thought   then  turning to cecilia  she added  in a whisper   you cannot imagine  my dear mrs mortimer  how i detest  this old cousin of mine  now pray tell me honestly if you don t hate him  yourself       i hope   said cecilia   to have no reason       lord  how you are always upon your guard  if i were half as cautious   i should die of the vapours in a month  the only thing that keeps me  at all alive  is now and then making people angry  for the folks at our  house let me go out so seldom  and then send me with such stupid  old chaperons  that giving them a little torment is really the only  entertainment i can procure myself  o  but i had almost forgot to tell  you a most delightful thing       what is it       why you must know i have the greatest hopes in the world that my father  will quarrel with old mr delvile       and is that such a delightful thing       o yes  i have lived upon the very idea this fortnight  for then  you  know  they ll both be in a passion  and i shall see which of them looks  frightfullest       when lady honoria whispers   cried mortimer   i always suspect some  mischief       no indeed   answered her ladyship   i was merely congratulating mrs  mortimer about her marriage  though really  upon second thoughts  i  don t know whether i should not rather condole with her  for i have long  been convinced she has a prodigious antipathy to you  i saw it the whole  time i was at delvile castle  where she used to change colour at the  very sound of your name  a symptom i never perceived when i talked to  her of my lord derford  who would certainly have made her a thousand  times a better husband       if you mean on account of his title  lady honoria   said mr delvile    your ladyship must be strangely forgetful of the connections of your  family  not to remember that mortimer  after the death of his uncle  and myself  must inevitably inherit one far more honourable than a  new sprung up family  like my lord ernolf s  could offer       yes  sir  but then  you know  she would have kept her estate  which  would have been a vastly better thing than an old pedigree of new  relations  besides  i don t find that any body cares for the noble blood  of the delviles but themselves  and if she had kept her fortune  every  body  i fancy  would have cared for  that        every body  then   said mr delvile   must be highly mercenary and  ignoble  or the blood of an ancient and honourable house  would  be thought contaminated by the most distant hint of so degrading a  comparison       dear sir  what should we all do with birth if it was not for wealth   it would neither take us to ranelagh nor the opera  nor buy us caps nor  wigs  nor supply us with dinners nor bouquets       caps and wigs  dinners and bouquets   interrupted mr delvile   your  ladyship s estimate of wealth is really extremely minute       why  you know  sir  as to caps and wigs  they are very serious things   for we should look mighty droll figures to go about bare headed  and  as to dinners  how would the delviles have lasted all these thousand  centuries if they had disdained eating them       whatever may be your ladyship s satisfaction   said mr delvile   angrily   in depreciating a house that has the honour of being nearly  allied with your own  you will not  i hope at least  instruct this  lady   turning to cecilia   to adopt a similar contempt of its antiquity  and dignity       this lady   cried mortimer   will at least  by condescending to become  one of it  secure us from any danger that such contempt may spread  further       let me but   said cecilia  looking gratefully at him   be as secure  from exciting as i am from feeling contempt  and what can i have to  wish       good and excellent young lady   said dr lyster   the first of blessings  indeed is yours in the temperance of your own mind  when you began your  career in life  you appeared to us short sighted mortals  to possess  more than your share of the good things of this world  such a union of  riches  beauty  independence  talents  education and virtue  seemed  a monopoly to raise general envy and discontent  but mark with what  scrupulous exactness the good and bad is ever balanced  you have had  a thousand sorrows to which those who have looked up to you have been  strangers  and for which not all the advantages you possess have been  equivalent  there is evidently throughout this world  in things as  well as persons  a levelling principle  at war with pre eminence  and  destructive of perfection       ah   cried mortimer  in a low voice to cecilia   how much higher  must we all rise  or how much lower must you fall  ere any levelling  principle will approximate us with you      he then entreated her to spare her strength and spirits by returning to  her own apartment  and the conversation was broken up      pray permit me  mrs mortimer   cried lady honoria  in taking leave    to beg that the first guest you invite to delvile castle may be me   you know my partiality to it already  i shall be particularly happy in  waiting upon you in tempestuous weather  we can all stroll out together   you know  very sociably  and i sha n t be much in your way  for if there  should happen to be a storm  you can easily lodge me under some great  tree  and while you amuse yourselves with a  tete a tete   give me the  indulgence of my own reflections  i am vastly fond of thinking  and  being alone  you know   especially in thunder and lightning      she then ran away  and they all separated  cecilia was conveyed up  stairs  and the worthy dr lyster  loaded with acknowledgments of every  kind  set out for the country     cecilia  still weak  and much emaciated  for some time lived almost  wholly in her own room  where the grateful and solicitous attendance of  mortimer  alleviated the pain both of her illness and confinement  but  as soon as her health permitted travelling  he hastened with her abroad     here tranquility once more made its abode the heart of cecilia  that  heart so long torn with anguish  suspense and horrour  mrs delvile  received her with the most rapturous fondness  and the impression of her  sorrows gradually wore away  from her kind and maternal cares  and from  the watchful affection and delighted tenderness of her son     the egglestons now took entire possession of her estate  and delvile  at  her entreaty  forbore shewing any personal resentment of their conduct   and put into the hands of a lawyer the arrangement of the affair     they continued abroad some months  and the health of mrs delvile was  tolerably re established  they were then summoned home by the death of  lord delvile  who bequeathed to his nephew mortimer his town house  and  whatever of his estate was not annexed to his title  which necessarily  devolved to his brother     the sister of mrs delvile  a woman of high spirit and strong passions   lived not long after him  but having  in her latter days  intimately  connected herself with cecilia  she was so much charmed with her  character  and so much dazzled by her admiration of the extraordinary  sacrifice she had made  that  in a fit of sudden enthusiasm  she altered  her will  to leave to her  and to her sole disposal  the fortune which   almost from his infancy  she had destined for her nephew  cecilia   astonished and penetrated  opposed the alteration  but even her sister   now lady delvile  to whom she daily became dearer  earnestly supported  it  while mortimer  delighted to restore to her through his own family   any part of that power and independence of which her generous and pure  regard for himself had deprived her  was absolute in refusing that the  deed should be revoked     cecilia  from this flattering transaction  received a further conviction  of the malignant falsehood of mr monckton  who had always represented  to her the whole of the delvile family as equally poor in their  circumstances  and illiberal in their minds  the strong spirit of  active benevolence which had ever marked her character  was now again  displayed  though no longer  as hitherto  unbounded  she had learnt  the error of profusion  even in charity and beneficence  and she had a  motive for oeconomy  in her animated affection for mortimer     she soon sent for albany  whose surprise that she still existed  and  whose rapture at her recovered prosperity  now threatened his senses  from the tumult of his joy  with nearly the same danger they had lately  been menaced by terror  but though her donations were circumscribed by  prudence  and their objects were selected with discrimination  she  gave to herself all her former benevolent pleasure  in solacing his  afflictions  while she softened his asperity  by restoring to him his  favourite office of being her almoner and monitor     she next sent to her own pensioners  relieved those distresses which her  sudden absence had occasioned  and renewed and continued the salaries  she had allowed them  all who had nourished reasonable expectations from  her bounty she remembered  though she raised no new claimants but with  oeconomy and circumspection  but neither albany nor the old pensioners  felt the satisfaction of mortimer  who saw with new wonder the virtues  of her mind  and whose admiration of her excellencies  made his  gratitude perpetual for the happiness of his lot     the tender hearted henrietta  in returning to her new friends  gave way   with artless openness  to the violence of untamed grief  but finding mr  arnott as wretched as herself  the sympathy cecilia had foreseen soon  endeared them to each other  while the little interest taken in either  by mrs harrel  made them almost inseparable companions     mrs harrel  wearied by their melancholy  and sick of retirement  took  the earliest opportunity that was offered her of changing her situation   she married very soon a man of fortune in the neighbourhood  and   quickly forgetting all the past  thoughtlessly began the world again   with new hopes  new connections   new equipages and new engagements     henrietta was then obliged to go again to her mother  where  though  deprived of all the indulgencies to which she was now become familiar   she was not more hurt by the separation than mr arnott  so sad and so  solitary his house seemed in her absence  that he soon followed her to  town  and returned not till he carried her back its mistress  and there  the gentle gratitude of her soft and feeling heart  engaged from the  worthy mr arnott the tenderest affection  and  in time  healed the wound  of his early and hopeless passion     the injudicious  the volatile  yet noble minded belfield  to whose  mutable and enterprising disposition life seemed always rather beginning  than progressive  roved from employment to employment  and from public  life to retirement  soured with the world  and discontented with  himself  till vanquished  at length  by the constant friendship of  delvile  he consented to accept his good offices in again entering the  army  and  being fortunately ordered out upon foreign service  his hopes  were revived by ambition  and his prospects were brightened by a view of  future honour     the wretched monckton  dupe of his own cunning and artifices  still  lived in lingering misery  doubtful which was most acute  the pain of  his wound and confinement  or of his defeat and disappointment  led on  by a vain belief that he had parts to conquer all difficulties  he had  indulged without restraint a passion in which interest was seconded by  inclination  allured by such fascinating powers  he shortly suffered  nothing to stop his course  and though when he began his career he would  have started at the mention of actual dishonour  long before it was  concluded  neither treachery nor perjury were regarded by him as  stumbling blocks     all fear of failing was lost in vanity  all sense of probity was sunk in  interest  all scruples of conscience were left behind by the heat of the  chace  yet the unforeseen and melancholy catastrophe of his long arts   illustrated in his despite what his principles had obscured  that  even in worldly pursuits where fraud out runs integrity  failure joins  dishonour to loss  and disappointment excites triumph instead of pity     the upright mind of cecilia  her purity  her virtue  and the moderation  of her wishes  gave to her in the warm affection of lady delvile  and  the unremitting fondness of mortimer  all the happiness human life seems  capable of receiving   yet human it was  and as such imperfect  she knew  that  at times  the whole family must murmur at her loss of fortune  and  at times she murmured herself to be thus portionless  tho  an heiress   rationally  however  she surveyed the world at large  and finding that  of the few who had any happiness  there were none without some misery   she checked the rising sigh of repining mortality  and  grateful with  general felicity  bore partial evil with chearfullest resignation                     and silent  some were irritable and petulant  none were  gentle humoured  all were thirsty     the ruffler put  jack  in hugo s charge  with some brief instructions   and commanded john canty to keep away from him and let him alone  he also  warned hugo not to be too rough with the lad     after a while the weather grew milder  and the clouds lifted somewhat   the troop ceased to shiver  and their spirits began to improve   they  grew more and more cheerful  and finally began to chaff each other and  insult passengers along the highway   this showed that they were awaking  to an appreciation of life and its joys once more   the dread in which  their sort was held was apparent in the fact that everybody gave them the  road  and took their ribald insolences meekly  without venturing to talk  back  they snatched linen from the hedges  occasionally in full view of  the owners  who made no protest  but only seemed grateful that they did  not take the hedges  too     by and by they invaded a small farmhouse and made themselves at home  while the trembling farmer and his people swept the larder clean to  furnish a breakfast for them   they chucked the housewife and her  daughters under the chin whilst receiving the food from their hands  and  made coarse jests about them  accompanied with insulting epithets and  bursts of horse laughter   they threw bones and vegetables at the farmer  and his sons  kept them dodging all the time  and applauded uproariously  when a good hit was made  they ended by buttering the head of one of the  daughters who resented some of their familiarities   when they took their  leave they threatened to come back and burn the house over the heads of  the family if any report of their doings got to the ears of the  authorities     about noon  after a long and weary tramp  the gang came to a halt behind  a hedge on the outskirts of a considerable village   an hour was allowed  for rest  then the crew scattered themselves abroad to enter the village  at different points to ply their various trades   jack  was sent with  hugo   they wandered hither and thither for some time  hugo watching for  opportunities to do a stroke of business  but finding none  so he finally  said       i see nought to steal  it is a paltry place   wherefore we will beg       we  forsooth   follow thy trade  it befits thee   but  i  will not beg       thou lt not beg   exclaimed hugo  eyeing the king with surprise    prithee  since when hast thou reformed       what dost thou mean       mean   hast thou not begged the streets of london all thy life       i   thou idiot       spare thy compliments  thy stock will last the longer   thy father says  thou hast begged all thy days   mayhap he lied  peradventure you will  even make so bold as to say he lied   scoffed hugo      him you call my father   yes  he lied       come  play not thy merry game of madman so far  mate  use it for thy  amusement  not thy hurt   an  i tell him this  he will scorch thee finely  for it       save thyself the trouble   i will tell him       i like thy spirit  i do in truth  but i do not admire thy judgment   bone rackings and bastings be plenty enow in this life  without going out  of one s way to invite them   but a truce to these matters   i  believe  your father   i doubt not he can lie  i doubt not he doth lie  upon  occasion  for the best of us do that  but there is no occasion here   a  wise man does not waste so good a commodity as lying for nought   but  come  sith it is thy humour to give over begging  wherewithal shall we  busy ourselves   with robbing kitchens      the king said  impatiently       have done with this folly  you weary me      hugo replied  with temper       now harkee  mate  you will not beg  you will not rob  so be it  but i  will tell you what you will do   you will play decoy whilst  i  beg   refuse  an  you think you may venture      the king was about to reply contemptuously  when hugo said  interrupting       peace   here comes one with a kindly face   now will i fall down in a  fit   when the stranger runs to me  set you up a wail  and fall upon your  knees  seeming to weep  then cry out as all the devils of misery were in  your belly  and say   oh  sir  it is my poor afflicted brother  and we be  friendless  o  god s name cast through your merciful eyes one pitiful  look upon a sick  forsaken  and most miserable wretch  bestow one little  penny out of thy riches upon one smitten of god and ready to perish      and mind you  keep you on wailing  and abate not till we bilk him of his  penny  else shall you rue it      then immediately hugo began to moan  and groan  and roll his eyes  and  reel and totter about  and when the stranger was close at hand  down he  sprawled before him  with a shriek  and began to writhe and wallow in the  dirt  in seeming agony      o  dear  o dear   cried the benevolent stranger   o poor soul  poor  soul  how he doth suffer   there  let me help thee up       o noble sir  forbear  and god love you for a princely gentleman  but it  giveth me cruel pain to touch me when i am taken so   my brother there  will tell your worship how i am racked with anguish when these fits be  upon me   a penny  dear sir  a penny  to buy a little food  then leave me  to my sorrows       a penny  thou shalt have three  thou hapless creature   and he fumbled  in his pocket with nervous haste and got them out   there  poor lad  take  them and most welcome   now come hither  my boy  and help me carry thy  stricken brother to yon house  where        i am not his brother   said the king  interrupting      what  not his brother       oh  hear him   groaned hugo  then privately ground his teeth   he denies  his own brother  and he with one foot in the grave       boy  thou art indeed hard of heart  if this is thy brother   for shame     and he scarce able to move hand or foot   if he is not thy brother  who  is he  then       a beggar and a thief   he has got your money and has picked your pocket  likewise   an  thou would st do a healing miracle  lay thy staff over his  shoulders and trust providence for the rest      but hugo did not tarry for the miracle   in a moment he was up and off  like the wind  the gentleman following after and raising the hue and cry  lustily as he went   the king  breathing deep gratitude to heaven for his  own release  fled in the opposite direction  and did not slacken his pace  until he was out of harm s reach   he took the first road that offered   and soon put the village behind him   he hurried along  as briskly as he  could  during several hours  keeping a nervous watch over his shoulder  for pursuit  but his fears left him at last  and a grateful sense of  security took their place   he recognised  now  that he was hungry  and  also very tired   so he halted at a farmhouse  but when he was about to  speak  he was cut short and driven rudely away   his clothes were against  him     he wandered on  wounded and indignant  and was resolved to put himself in  the way of like treatment no more   but hunger is pride s master  so  as  the evening drew near  he made an attempt at another farmhouse  but here  he fared worse than before  for he was called hard names and was promised  arrest as a vagrant except he moved on promptly     the night came on  chilly and overcast  and still the footsore monarch  laboured slowly on   he was obliged to keep moving  for every time he sat  down to rest he was soon penetrated to the bone with the cold   all his  sensations and experiences  as he moved through the solemn gloom and the  empty vastness of the night  were new and strange to him   at intervals  he heard voices approach  pass by  and fade into silence  and as he saw  nothing more of the bodies they belonged to than a sort of formless  drifting blur  there was something spectral and uncanny about it all that  made him shudder   occasionally he caught the twinkle of a light  always  far away  apparently  almost in another world  if he heard the tinkle of  a sheep s bell  it was vague  distant  indistinct  the muffled lowing of  the herds floated to him on the night wind in vanishing cadences  a  mournful sound  now and then came the complaining howl of a dog over  viewless expanses of field and forest  all sounds were remote  they made  the little king feel that all life and activity were far removed from  him  and that he stood solitary  companionless  in the centre of a  measureless solitude     he stumbled along  through the gruesome fascinations of this new  experience  startled occasionally by the soft rustling of the dry leaves  overhead  so like human whispers they seemed to sound  and by and by he  came suddenly upon the freckled light of a tin lantern near at hand   he  stepped back into the shadows and waited   the lantern stood by the open  door of a barn   the king waited some time  there was no sound  and  nobody stirring   he got so cold  standing still  and the hospitable barn  looked so enticing  that at last he resolved to risk everything and  enter  he started swiftly and stealthily  and just as he was crossing the  threshold he heard voices behind him   he darted behind a cask  within  the barn  and stooped down   two farm labourers came in  bringing the  lantern with them  and fell to work  talking meanwhile   whilst they  moved about with the light  the king made good use of his eyes and took  the bearings of what seemed to be a good sized stall at the further end  of the place  purposing to grope his way to it when he should be left to  himself   he also noted the position of a pile of horse blankets  midway  of the route  with the intent to levy upon them for the service of the  crown of england for one night     by and by the men finished and went away  fastening the door behind them  and taking the lantern with them   the shivering king made for the  blankets  with as good speed as the darkness would allow  gathered them  up  and then groped his way safely to the stall   of two of the blankets  he made a bed  then covered himself with the remaining two   he was a  glad monarch  now  though the blankets were old and thin  and not quite  warm enough  and besides gave out a pungent horsey odour that was almost  suffocatingly powerful     although the king was hungry and chilly  he was also so tired and  so drowsy that these latter influences soon began to get the  advantage of the former  and he presently dozed off into a state of  semi consciousness   then  just as he was on the point of losing himself  wholly  he distinctly felt something touch him   he was broad awake in a  moment  and gasping for breath   the cold horror of that mysterious touch  in the dark almost made his heart stand still   he lay motionless  and  listened  scarcely breathing  but nothing stirred  and there was no  sound   he continued to listen  and wait  during what seemed a long time   but still nothing stirred  and there was no sound   so he began to drop  into a drowse once more  at last  and all at once he felt that mysterious  touch again   it was a grisly thing  this light touch from this noiseless  and invisible presence  it made the boy sick with ghostly fears   what  should he do   that was the question  but he did not know how to answer  it   should he leave these reasonably comfortable quarters and fly from  this inscrutable horror   but fly whither   he could not get out of the  barn  and the idea of scurrying blindly hither and thither in the dark   within the captivity of the four walls  with this phantom gliding after  him  and visiting him with that soft hideous touch upon cheek or shoulder  at every turn  was intolerable   but to stay where he was  and endure  this living death all night  was that better   no   what  then  was there  left to do   ah  there was but one course  he knew it well  he must put  out his hand and find that thing     it was easy to think this  but it was hard to brace himself up to try it   three times he stretched his hand a little way out into the dark   gingerly  and snatched it suddenly back  with a gasp  not because it had  encountered anything  but because he had felt so sure it was just going  to   but the fourth time  he groped a little further  and his hand  lightly swept against something soft and warm   this petrified him   nearly  with fright  his mind was in such a state that he could imagine  the thing to be nothing else than a corpse  newly dead and still warm   he thought he would rather die than touch it again   but he thought this  false thought because he did not know the immortal strength of human  curiosity  in no long time his hand was tremblingly groping again    against his judgment  and without his consent  but groping persistently  on  just the same   it encountered a bunch of long hair  he shuddered   but followed up the hair and found what seemed to be a warm rope   followed up the rope and found an innocent calf   for the rope was not a  rope at all  but the calf s tail     the king was cordially ashamed of himself for having gotten all that  fright and misery out of so paltry a matter as a slumbering calf  but he  need not have felt so about it  for it was not the calf that frightened  him  but a dreadful non existent something which the calf stood for  and  any other boy  in those old superstitious times  would have acted and  suffered just as he had done     the king was not only delighted to find that the creature was only a  calf  but delighted to have the calf s company  for he had been feeling  so lonesome and friendless that the company and comradeship of even this  humble animal were welcome   and he had been so buffeted  so rudely  entreated by his own kind  that it was a real comfort to him to feel that  he was at last in the society of a fellow creature that had at least a  soft heart and a gentle spirit  whatever loftier attributes might be  lacking   so he resolved to waive rank and make friends with the calf     while stroking its sleek warm back  for it lay near him and within easy  reach  it occurred to him that this calf might be utilised in more ways  than one   whereupon he re arranged his bed  spreading it down close to  the calf  then he cuddled himself up to the calf s back  drew the covers  up over himself and his friend  and in a minute or two was as warm and  comfortable as he had ever been in the downy couches of the regal palace  of westminster     pleasant thoughts came at once  life took on a cheerfuller seeming   he  was free of the bonds of servitude and crime  free of the companionship  of base and brutal outlaws  he was warm  he was sheltered  in a word  he  was happy   the night wind was rising  it swept by in fitful gusts that  made the old barn quake and rattle  then its forces died down at  intervals  and went moaning and wailing around corners and projections    but it was all music to the king  now that he was snug and comfortable   let it blow and rage  let it batter and bang  let it moan and wail  he  minded it not  he only enjoyed it   he merely snuggled the closer to his  friend  in a luxury of warm contentment  and drifted blissfully out of  consciousness into a deep and dreamless sleep that was full of serenity  and peace   the distant dogs howled  the melancholy kine complained  and  the winds went on raging  whilst furious sheets of rain drove along the  roof  but the majesty of england slept on  undisturbed  and the calf did  the same  it being a simple creature  and not easily troubled by storms  or embarrassed by sleeping with a king         chapter xix  the prince with the peasants     when the king awoke in the early morning  he found that a wet but  thoughtful rat had crept into the place during the night and made a cosy  bed for itself in his bosom   being disturbed now  it scampered away   the boy smiled  and said   poor fool  why so fearful   i am as forlorn as  thou    twould be a sham in me to hurt the helpless  who am myself so  helpless   moreover  i owe you thanks for a good omen  for when a king  has fallen so low that the very rats do make a bed of him  it surely  meaneth that his fortunes be upon the turn  since it is plain he can no  lower go      he got up and stepped out of the stall  and just then he heard the sound  of children s voices   the barn door opened and a couple of little girls  came in   as soon as they saw him their talking and laughing ceased  and  they stopped and stood still  gazing at him with strong curiosity  they  presently began to whisper together  then they approached nearer  and  stopped again to gaze and whisper   by and by they gathered courage and  began to discuss him aloud   one said       he hath a comely face      the other added       and pretty hair       but is ill clothed enow       and how starved he looketh      they came still nearer  sidling shyly around and about him  examining him  minutely from all points  as if he were some strange new kind of animal   but warily and watchfully the while  as if they half feared he might be a  sort of animal that would bite  upon occasion   finally they halted  before him  holding each other s hands for protection  and took a good  satisfying stare with their innocent eyes  then one of them plucked up  all her courage and inquired with honest directness       who art thou  boy       i am the king   was the grave answer     the children gave a little start  and their eyes spread themselves wide  open and remained so during a speechless half minute   then curiosity  broke the silence       the king   what king       the king of england      the children looked at each other  then at him  then at each other again    wonderingly  perplexedly  then one said       didst hear him  margery   he said he is the king   can that be true       how can it be else but true  prissy   would he say a lie   for look you   prissy  an  it were not true  it would be a lie   it surely would be   now think on t   for all things that be not true  be lies  thou canst  make nought else out of it      it was a good tight argument  without a leak in it anywhere  and it left  prissy s half doubts not a leg to stand on   she considered a moment   then put the king upon his honour with the simple remark       if thou art truly the king  then i believe thee       i am truly the king      this settled the matter   his majesty s royalty was accepted without  further question or discussion  and the two little girls began at once to  inquire into how he came to be where he was  and how he came to be so  unroyally clad  and whither he was bound  and all about his affairs   it  was a mighty relief to him to pour out his troubles where they would not  be scoffed at or doubted  so he told his tale with feeling  forgetting  even his hunger for the time  and it was received with the deepest and  tenderest sympathy by the gentle little maids   but when he got down to  his latest experiences and they learned how long he had been without  food  they cut him short and hurried him away to the farmhouse to find a  breakfast for him     the king was cheerful and happy now  and said to himself   when i am come  to mine own again  i will always honour little children  remembering how  that these trusted me and believed in me in my time of trouble  whilst  they that were older  and thought themselves wiser  mocked at me and held  me for a liar      the children s mother received the king kindly  and was full of pity  for  his forlorn condition and apparently crazed intellect touched her womanly  heart   she was a widow  and rather poor  consequently she had seen  trouble enough to enable her to feel for the unfortunate   she imagined  that the demented boy had wandered away from his friends or keepers  so  she tried to find out whence he had come  in order that she might take  measures to return him  but all her references to neighbouring towns and  villages  and all her inquiries in the same line went for nothing  the  boy s face  and his answers  too  showed that the things she was talking  of were not familiar to him   he spoke earnestly and simply about court  matters  and broke down  more than once  when speaking of the late king   his father   but whenever the conversation changed to baser topics  he  lost interest and became silent     the woman was mightily puzzled  but she did not give up   as she  proceeded with her cooking  she set herself to contriving devices to  surprise the boy into betraying his real secret   she talked about  cattle  he showed no concern  then about sheep  the same result   so her  guess that he had been a shepherd boy was an error  she talked about  mills  and about weavers  tinkers  smiths  trades and tradesmen of all  sorts  and about bedlam  and jails  and charitable retreats   but no  matter  she was baffled at all points   not altogether  either  for she  argued that she had narrowed the thing down to domestic service   yes   she was sure she was on the right track  now  he must have been a house  servant   so she led up to that   but the result was discouraging  the  subject of sweeping appeared to weary him  fire building failed to stir  him  scrubbing and scouring awoke no enthusiasm  the goodwife touched   with a perishing hope  and rather as a matter of form  upon the subject  of cooking   to her surprise  and her vast delight  the king s face  lighted at once   ah  she had hunted him down at last  she thought  and  she was right proud  too  of the devious shrewdness and tact which had  accomplished it     her tired tongue got a chance to rest  now  for the king s  inspired by  gnawing hunger and the fragrant smells that came from the sputtering pots  and pans  turned itself loose and delivered itself up to such an eloquent  dissertation upon certain toothsome dishes  that within three minutes the  woman said to herself   of a truth i was right  he hath holpen in a  kitchen    then he broadened his bill of fare  and discussed it with such  appreciation and animation  that the goodwife said to herself   good  lack  how can he know so many dishes  and so fine ones withal   for these  belong only upon the tables of the rich and great   ah  now i see  ragged  outcast as he is  he must have served in the palace before his reason  went astray  yes  he must have helped in the very kitchen of the king  himself   i will test him      full of eagerness to prove her sagacity  she told the king to mind the  cooking a moment  hinting that he might manufacture and add a dish or  two  if he chose  then she went out of the room and gave her children a  sign to follow after   the king muttered       another english king had a commission like to this  in a bygone time  it  is nothing against my dignity to undertake an office which the great  alfred stooped to assume   but i will try to better serve my trust than  he  for he let the cakes burn      the intent was good  but the performance was not answerable to it  for  this king  like the other one  soon fell into deep thinkings concerning  his vast affairs  and the same calamity resulted  the cookery got burned   the woman returned in time to save the breakfast from entire destruction   and she promptly brought the king out of his dreams with a brisk and  cordial tongue lashing  then  seeing how troubled he was over his  violated trust  she softened at once  and was all goodness and gentleness  toward him     the boy made a hearty and satisfying meal  and was greatly refreshed and  gladdened by it   it was a meal which was distinguished by this curious  feature  that rank was waived on both sides  yet neither recipient of the  favour was aware that it had been extended   the goodwife had intended to  feed this young tramp with broken victuals in a corner  like any other  tramp or like a dog  but she was so remorseful for the scolding she had  given him  that she did what she could to atone for it by allowing him to  sit at the family table and eat with his betters  on ostensible terms of  equality with them  and the king  on his side  was so remorseful for  having broken his trust  after the family had been so kind to him  that  he forced himself to atone for it by humbling himself to the family  level  instead of requiring the woman and her children to stand and wait  upon him  while he occupied their table in the solitary state due to his  birth and dignity   it does us all good to unbend sometimes   this good  woman was made happy all the day long by the applauses which she got out  of herself for her magnanimous condescension to a tramp  and the king was  just as self complacent over his gracious humility toward a humble  peasant woman     when breakfast was over  the housewife told the king to wash up the  dishes   this command was a staggerer  for a moment  and the king came  near rebelling  but then he said to himself   alfred the great watched  the cakes  doubtless he would have washed the dishes too  therefore will  i essay it      he made a sufficiently poor job of it  and to his surprise too  for the  cleaning of wooden spoons and trenchers had seemed an easy thing to do   it was a tedious and troublesome piece of work  but he finished it at  last   he was becoming impatient to get away on his journey now  however   he was not to lose this thrifty dame s society so easily   she furnished  him some little odds and ends of employment  which he got through with  after a fair fashion and with some credit   then she set him and the  little girls to paring some winter apples  but he was so awkward at this  service that she retired him from it and gave him a butcher knife to  grind  afterwards she kept him carding wool until he began to think he  had laid the good king alfred about far enough in the shade for the  present in the matter of showy menial heroisms that would read  picturesquely in story books and histories  and so he was half minded to  resign   and when  just after the noonday dinner  the goodwife gave him a  basket of kittens to drown  he did resign   at least he was just going to  resign  for he felt that he must draw the line somewhere  and it seemed  to him that to draw it at kitten drowning was about the right thing  when  there was an interruption   the interruption was john canty  with a  peddler s pack on his back  and hugo     the king discovered these rascals approaching the front gate before they  had had a chance to see him  so he said nothing about drawing the line   but took up his basket of kittens and stepped quietly out the back way   without a word   he left the creatures in an out house  and hurried on   into a narrow lane at the rear         chapter xx  the prince and the hermit     the high hedge hid him from the house  now  and so  under the impulse of  a deadly fright  he let out all his forces and sped toward a wood in the  distance   he never looked back until he had almost gained the shelter of  the forest  then he turned and descried two figures in the distance   that was sufficient  he did not wait to scan them critically  but hurried  on  and never abated his pace till he was far within the twilight depths  of the wood  then he stopped  being persuaded that he was now tolerably  safe  he listened intently  but the stillness was profound and solemn    awful  even  and depressing to the spirits   at wide intervals his  straining ear did detect sounds  but they were so remote  and hollow  and  mysterious  that they seemed not to be real sounds  but only the moaning  and complaining ghosts of departed ones   so the sounds were yet more  dreary than the silence which they interrupted     it was his purpose  in the beginning  to stay where he was the rest of  the day  but a chill soon invaded his perspiring body  and he was at last  obliged to resume movement in order to get warm  he struck straight  through the forest  hoping to pierce to a road presently  but he was  disappointed in this   he travelled on and on  but the farther he went   the denser the wood became  apparently   the gloom began to thicken   by and by  and the king realised that the night was coming on   it made  him shudder to think of spending it in such an uncanny place  so he tried  to hurry faster  but he only made the less speed  for he could not now  see well enough to choose his steps judiciously  consequently he kept  tripping over roots and tangling himself in vines and briers     and how glad he was when at last he caught the glimmer of a light  he  approached it warily  stopping often to look about him and listen   it  came from an unglazed window opening in a shabby little hut   he heard a  voice  now  and felt a disposition to run and hide  but he changed his  mind at once  for this voice was praying  evidently   he glided to the  one window of the hut  raised himself on tiptoe  and stole a glance  within   the room was small  its floor was the natural earth  beaten hard  by use  in a corner was a bed of rushes and a ragged blanket or two  near  it was a pail  a cup  a basin  and two or three pots and pans  there was  a short bench and a three legged stool  on the hearth the remains of a  faggot fire were smouldering  before a shrine  which was lighted by a  single candle  knelt an aged man  and on an old wooden box at his side  lay an open book and a human skull   the man was of large  bony frame   his hair and whiskers were very long and snowy white  he was clothed in a  robe of sheepskins which reached from his neck to his heels      a holy hermit   said the king to himself   now am i indeed fortunate      the hermit rose from his knees  the king knocked   a deep voice  responded       enter   but leave sin behind  for the ground whereon thou shalt stand is  holy      the king entered  and paused   the hermit turned a pair of gleaming   unrestful eyes upon him  and said       who art thou       i am the king   came the answer  with placid simplicity      welcome  king   cried the hermit  with enthusiasm   then  bustling about  with feverish activity  and constantly saying   welcome  welcome   he  arranged his bench  seated the king on it  by the hearth  threw some  faggots on the fire  and finally fell to pacing the floor with a nervous  stride      welcome   many have sought sanctuary here  but they were not worthy  and  were turned away   but a king who casts his crown away  and despises the  vain splendours of his office  and clothes his body in rags  to devote  his life to holiness and the mortification of the flesh  he is worthy  he  is welcome   here shall he abide all his days till death come    the king  hastened to interrupt and explain  but the hermit paid no attention to  him  did not even hear him  apparently  but went right on with his talk   with a raised voice and a growing energy    and thou shalt be at peace  here   none shall find out thy refuge to disquiet thee with supplications  to return to that empty and foolish life which god hath moved thee to  abandon   thou shalt pray here  thou shalt study the book  thou shalt  meditate upon the follies and delusions of this world  and upon the  sublimities of the world to come  thou shalt feed upon crusts and herbs   and scourge thy body with whips  daily  to the purifying of thy soul   thou shalt wear a hair shirt next thy skin  thou shalt drink water only   and thou shalt be at peace  yes  wholly at peace  for whoso comes to seek  thee shall go his way again  baffled  he shall not find thee  he shall  not molest thee      the old man  still pacing back and forth  ceased to speak aloud  and  began to mutter   the king seized this opportunity to state his case  and  he did it with an eloquence inspired by uneasiness and apprehension   but  the hermit went on muttering  and gave no heed   and still muttering  he  approached the king and said impressively        sh   i will tell you a secret    he bent down to impart it  but checked  himself  and assumed a listening attitude   after a moment or two he went  on tiptoe to the window opening  put his head out  and peered around in  the gloaming  then came tiptoeing back again  put his face close down to  the king s  and whispered       i am an archangel      the king started violently  and said to himself   would god i were with  the outlaws again  for lo  now am i the prisoner of a madman    his  apprehensions were heightened  and they showed plainly in his face   in a  low excited voice the hermit continued       i see you feel my atmosphere   there s awe in your face   none may be in  this atmosphere and not be thus affected  for it is the very atmosphere  of heaven   i go thither and return  in the twinkling of an eye   i was  made an archangel on this very spot  it is five years ago  by angels sent  from heaven to confer that awful dignity   their presence filled this  place with an intolerable brightness   and they knelt to me  king  yes   they knelt to me  for i was greater than they   i have walked in the  courts of heaven  and held speech with the patriarchs   touch my hand  be  not afraid  touch it   there  now thou hast touched a hand which has been  clasped by abraham and isaac and jacob   for i have walked in the golden  courts  i have seen the deity face to face    he paused  to give this  speech effect  then his face suddenly changed  and he started to his feet  again saying  with angry energy   yes  i am an archangel  a mere  archangel   i that might have been pope   it is verily true   i was told  it from heaven in a dream  twenty years ago  ah  yes  i was to be pope     and i should have been pope  for heaven had said it  but the king  dissolved my religious house  and i  poor obscure unfriended monk  was  cast homeless upon the world  robbed of my mighty destiny   here he began  to mumble again  and beat his forehead in futile rage  with his fist  now  and then articulating a venomous curse  and now and then a pathetic   wherefore i am nought but an archangel  i that should have been pope      so he went on  for an hour  whilst the poor little king sat and suffered   then all at once the old man s frenzy departed  and he became all  gentleness   his voice softened  he came down out of his clouds  and fell  to prattling along so simply and so humanly  that he soon won the king s  heart completely   the old devotee moved the boy nearer to the fire and  made him comfortable  doctored his small bruises and abrasions with a  deft and tender hand  and then set about preparing and cooking a supper    chatting pleasantly all the time  and occasionally stroking the lad s  cheek or patting his head  in such a gently caressing way that in a  little while all the fear and repulsion inspired by the archangel were  changed to reverence and affection for the man     this happy state of things continued while the two ate the supper  then   after a prayer before the shrine  the hermit put the boy to bed  in a  small adjoining room  tucking him in as snugly and lovingly as a mother  might  and so  with a parting caress  left him and sat down by the fire   and began to poke the brands about in an absent and aimless way   presently he paused  then tapped his forehead several times with his  fingers  as if trying to recall some thought which had escaped from his  mind   apparently he was unsuccessful   now he started quickly up  and  entered his guest s room  and said       thou art king       yes   was the response  drowsily uttered      what king       of england       of england   then henry is gone       alack  it is so   i am his son      a black frown settled down upon the hermit s face  and he clenched his  bony hands with a vindictive energy   he stood a few moments  breathing  fast and swallowing repeatedly  then said in a husky voice       dost know it was he that turned us out into the world houseless and  homeless      there was no response   the old man bent down and scanned the boy s  reposeful face and listened to his placid breathing    he sleeps  sleeps  soundly   and the frown vanished away and gave place to an expression of  evil satisfaction   a smile flitted across the dreaming boy s features   the hermit muttered   so  his heart is happy   and he turned away   he  went stealthily about the place  seeking here and there for something   now and then halting to listen  now and then jerking his head around and  casting a quick glance toward the bed  and always muttering  always  mumbling to himself   at last he found what he seemed to want  a rusty  old butcher knife and a whetstone   then he crept to his place by the  fire  sat himself down  and began to whet the knife softly on the stone   still muttering  mumbling  ejaculating   the winds sighed around the  lonely place  the mysterious voices of the night floated by out of the  distances   the shining eyes of venturesome mice and rats peered out at  the old man from cracks and coverts  but he went on with his work  rapt   absorbed  and noted none of these things     at long intervals he drew his thumb along the edge of his knife  and  nodded his head with satisfaction    it grows sharper   he said   yes  it  grows sharper      he took no note of the flight of time  but worked tranquilly on   entertaining himself with his thoughts  which broke out occasionally in  articulate speech       his father wrought us evil  he destroyed us  and is gone down into the  eternal fires   yes  down into the eternal fires   he escaped us  but it  was god s will  yes it was god s will  we must not repine   but he hath  not escaped the fires   no  he hath not escaped the fires  the consuming   unpitying  remorseless fires  and they are everlasting      and so he wrought  and still wrought  mumbling  chuckling a low rasping  chuckle at times  and at times breaking again into words       it was his father that did it all   i am but an archangel  but for him i  should be pope      the king stirred   the hermit sprang noiselessly to the bedside  and went  down upon his knees  bending over the prostrate form with his knife  uplifted   the boy stirred again  his eyes came open for an instant  but  there was no speculation in them  they saw nothing  the next moment his  tranquil breathing showed that his sleep was sound once more     the hermit watched and listened  for a time  keeping his position and  scarcely breathing  then he slowly lowered his arms  and presently crept  away  saying        it is long past midnight  it is not best that he should cry out  lest by  accident someone be passing      he glided about his hovel  gathering a rag here  a thong there  and  another one yonder  then he returned  and by careful and gentle handling  he managed to tie the king s ankles together without waking him   next he  essayed to tie the wrists  he made several attempts to cross them  but  the boy always drew one hand or the other away  just as the cord was  ready to be applied  but at last  when the archangel was almost ready to  despair  the boy crossed his hands himself  and the next moment they were  bound  now a bandage was passed under the sleeper s chin and brought up  over his head and tied fast  and so softly  so gradually  and so deftly  were the knots drawn together and compacted  that the boy slept  peacefully through it all without stirring         chapter xxi  hendon to the rescue     the old man glided away  stooping  stealthy  cat like  and brought the  low bench   he seated himself upon it  half his body in the dim and  flickering light  and the other half in shadow  and so  with his craving  eyes bent upon the slumbering boy  he kept his patient vigil there   heedless of the drift of time  and softly whetted his knife  and mumbled  and chuckled  and in aspect and attitude he resembled nothing so much as  a grizzly  monstrous spider  gloating over some hapless insect that lay  bound and helpless in his web     after a long while  the old man  who was still gazing   yet not seeing   his mind having settled into a dreamy abstraction   observed  on a  sudden  that the boy s eyes were open  wide open and staring   staring up  in frozen horror at the knife   the smile of a gratified devil crept over  the old man s face  and he said  without changing his attitude or his  occupation       son of henry the eighth  hast thou prayed      the boy struggled helplessly in his bonds  and at the same time forced a  smothered sound through his closed jaws  which the hermit chose to  interpret as an affirmative answer to his question      then pray again   pray the prayer for the dying      a shudder shook the boy s frame  and his face blenched   then he  struggled again to free himself  turning and twisting himself this way  and that  tugging frantically  fiercely  desperately  but uselessly  to  burst his fetters  and all the while the old ogre smiled down upon him   and nodded his head  and placidly whetted his knife  mumbling  from time  to time   the moments are precious  they are few and precious  pray the  prayer for the dying      the boy uttered a despairing groan  and ceased from his struggles   panting   the tears came  then  and trickled  one after the other  down  his face  but this piteous sight wrought no softening effect upon the  savage old man     the dawn was coming now  the hermit observed it  and spoke up sharply   with a touch of nervous apprehension in his voice       i may not indulge this ecstasy longer   the night is already gone   it  seems but a moment  only a moment  would it had endured a year   seed of  the church s spoiler  close thy perishing eyes  an  thou fearest to look  upon       the rest was lost in inarticulate mutterings   the old man sank upon his  knees  his knife in his hand  and bent himself over the moaning boy     hark   there was a sound of voices near the cabin  the knife dropped from  the hermit s hand  he cast a sheepskin over the boy and started up   trembling   the sounds increased  and presently the voices became rough  and angry  then came blows  and cries for help  then a clatter of swift  footsteps  retreating   immediately came a succession of thundering  knocks upon the cabin door  followed by       hullo o o   open   and despatch  in the name of all the devils      oh  this was the blessedest sound that had ever made music in the king s  ears  for it was miles hendon s voice     the hermit  grinding his teeth in impotent rage  moved swiftly out of the  bedchamber  closing the door behind him  and straightway the king heard a  talk  to this effect  proceeding from the  chapel         homage and greeting  reverend sir   where is the boy  my boy       what boy  friend       what boy   lie me no lies  sir priest  play me no deceptions   i am not  in the humour for it   near to this place i caught the scoundrels who i  judged did steal him from me  and i made them confess  they said he was  at large again  and they had tracked him to your door   they showed me  his very footprints   now palter no more  for look you  holy sir  an   thou produce him not  where is the boy       o good sir  peradventure you mean the ragged regal vagrant that tarried  here the night   if such as you take an interest in such as he  know   then  that i have sent him of an errand   he will be back anon       how soon   how soon   come  waste not the time  cannot i overtake him   how soon will he be back       thou need st not stir  he will return quickly       so be it  then   i will try to wait   but stop   you sent him of an  errand   you   verily this is a lie  he would not go   he would pull thy  old beard  an  thou didst offer him such an insolence  thou hast lied   friend  thou hast surely lied   he would not go for thee  nor for any  man       for any man  no  haply not   but i am not a man       what   now o  god s name what art thou  then       it is a secret  mark thou reveal it not   i am an archangel      there was a tremendous ejaculation from miles hendon  not altogether  unprofane  followed by       this doth well and truly account for his complaisance   right well i  knew he would budge nor hand nor foot in the menial service of any  mortal  but  lord  even a king must obey when an archangel gives the word  o  command   let me   sh   what noise was that      all this while the little king had been yonder  alternately quaking with  terror and trembling with hope  and all the while  too  he had thrown all  the strength he could into his anguished moanings  constantly expecting  them to reach hendon s ear  but always realising  with bitterness  that  they failed  or at least made no impression   so this last remark of his  servant came as comes a reviving breath from fresh fields to the dying   and he exerted himself once more  and with all his energy  just as the  hermit was saying       noise   i heard only the wind       mayhap it was   yes  doubtless that was it   i have been hearing it  faintly all the  there it is again   it is not the wind   what an odd  sound   come  we will hunt it out      now the king s joy was nearly insupportable   his tired lungs did their  utmost  and hopefully  too  but the sealed jaws and the muffling  sheepskin sadly crippled the effort   then the poor fellow s heart sank   to hear the hermit say       ah  it came from without  i think from the copse yonder   come  i will  lead the way      the king heard the two pass out  talking  heard their footsteps die  quickly away  then he was alone with a boding  brooding  awful silence     it seemed an age till he heard the steps and voices approaching again    and this time he heard an added sound   the trampling of hoofs   apparently   then he heard hendon say       i will not wait longer   i cannot wait longer   he has lost his way in  this thick wood   which direction took he   quick  point it out to me       he  but wait  i will go with thee       good  good   why  truly thou art better than thy looks   marry i do not  think there s not another archangel with so right a heart as thine   wilt  ride   wilt take the wee donkey that s for my boy  or wilt thou fork thy  holy legs over this ill conditioned slave of a mule that i have provided  for myself   and had been cheated in too  had he cost but the indifferent  sum of a month s usury on a brass farthing let to a tinker out of work       no  ride thy mule  and lead thine ass  i am surer on mine own feet  and  will walk       then prithee mind the little beast for me while i take my life in my  hands and make what success i may toward mounting the big one      then followed a confusion of kicks  cuffs  tramplings and plungings   accompanied by a thunderous intermingling of volleyed curses  and finally  a bitter apostrophe to the mule  which must have broken its spirit  for  hostilities seemed to cease from that moment     with unutterable misery the fettered little king heard the voices and  footsteps fade away and die out   all hope forsook him  now  for the  moment  and a dull despair settled down upon his heart   my only friend  is deceived and got rid of   he said   the hermit will return and     he  finished with a gasp  and at once fell to struggling so frantically with  his bonds again  that he shook off the smothering sheepskin     and now he heard the door open   the sound chilled him to the marrow    already he seemed to feel the knife at his throat   horror made him close  his eyes  horror made him open them again  and before him stood john  canty and hugo     he would have said  thank god   if his jaws had been free     a moment or two later his limbs were at liberty  and his captors  each  gripping him by an arm  were hurrying him with all speed through the  forest             duke    the abduction    a crack shot    the challenge    the party at killarney     etched by w  h  w  bicknell from drawings by samuel lover           chapter xxii      the night was pitch dark  and on rounding the adjacent corner no vehicle  could be seen  but a peculiar whistle from dick was answered by the  sound of approaching wheels and the rapid footfalls of a horse  mingled  with the light rattle of a smart gig  on the vehicle coming up  dick  took his little mare  that was blacker than the night  by the head  the  apron of the gig was thrown down  and out jumped a smart servant boy      you have the horse ready  too  billy       yis  sir   said billy  touching his hat      then follow  and keep up with me  remember       yis  sir       come to her head  here   and he patted the little mare s neck as he  spoke with a caressing  whoa   which was answered by a low neigh of  satisfaction  while the impatient pawing of her fore foot showed the  animal s desire to start   what an impatient little devil she is   said  dick  as he mounted the gig   i ll get in first  murphy  as i m going  to drive  now up with you  hook on the apron  that s it  are you all  right       quite   said murphy      then you be into your saddle and after us  billy   said dick   and now  let her go      billy gave the little black mare her head  and away she went  at a  slapping pace  the fire from the road answering the rapid strokes of  her nimble feet  the servant then mounted a horse which was tied to  a neighbouring palisade  and had to gallop for it to come up with his  master  who was driving with a swiftness almost fearful  considering the  darkness of the night and the narrowness of the road he had to traverse   for he was making the best of his course by cross ways to an adjacent  roadside inn  where some non resident electors were expected to arrive  that night by a coach from dublin  for the county town had every nook  and cranny occupied  and this inn was the nearest point where they could  get any accommodation     now don t suppose that they were electors whom murphy and dick in their  zeal for their party were going over to greet with hearty welcomes and  bring up to the poll the next day  by no means  they were the friends  of the opposite party  and it was with the design of retarding their  movements that this night s excursion was undertaken  these electors  were a batch of plain citizens from dublin  whom the scatterbrain  interest had induced to leave the peace and quiet of the city to tempt  the wilds of the country at that wildest of times  during a contested  election  and a night coach was freighted inside and out with the worthy  cits  whose aggregate voices would be of immense importance the next  day  for the contest was close  the county nearly polled out  and  but two days more for the struggle  now  to intercept these plain  unsuspecting men was the object of murphy  whose well supplied  information had discovered to him this plan of the enemy  which he set  about countermining  as they rattled over the rough by roads  many a  laugh did the merry attorney and the untameable dick the devil exchange   as the probable success of their scheme was canvassed  and fresh  expedients devised to meet the possible impediments which might  interrupt them  as they topped a hill murphy pointed out to his  companion a moving light in the plain beneath      that s the coach  dick  there are the lamps  we re just in time  spin  down the hill  my boy  let me get in as they re at supper  and  faith  they ll want it  after coming off a coach such a night as this  to say  nothing of some of them being aldermen in expectancy perhaps  and of  course obliged to play trencher men as often as they can  as a requisite  rehearsal for the parts they must hereafter fill      in fifteen minutes more dick pulled up before a small cabin within a  quarter of a mile of the inn  and the mounted servant tapped at the  door  which was immediately opened  and a peasant  advancing to the gig   returned the civil salutation with which dick greeted his approach      i wanted to be sure you were ready  barny       oh  do you think i d fail you  misther dick  your honour       i thought you might be asleep  barny       not when you bid me wake  sir  and there s a nice fire ready for you   and as fine a dhrop o   potteen  as ever tickled your tongue  sir       you re the lad  barny   good fellow  i ll be back with you by and by    and off whipped dick again     after going about a quarter of a mile further  he pulled up  alighted  with murphy from the gig  unharnessed the little black mare  and then  overturned the gig into the ditch      that s as natural as life   said dick      what an escape of my neck i ve had   said murphy      are you much hurt   said dick      a trifle lame only   said murphy  laughing and limping      there was a great  boccagh   footnote  lame beggar   lost in you   murphy  wait  let me rub a handful of mud on your face  there  you have  a very upset look   pon my soul   said dick  as he flashed the light of  his lantern on him for a moment  and laughed at murphy scooping the mud  out of his eye  where dick had purposely planted it      devil take you   said murtough   that s too natural       there s nothing like looking your part   said dick      well  i may as well complete my attire   said murtough  so he lay down  in the road and took a roll in the mud   that will do   said he   and  now  dick  go back to barny and the mountain dew  while i storm the  camp of the philistines  i think in a couple of hours you may be on the  look out for me  i ll signal you from the window  so now good bye    and murphy  leading the mare  proceeded to the inn  while dick  with a  parting  luck to you  my boy   turned back to the cottage of barny     the coach had set down six inside and ten out passengers  all voters   about ten minutes before murphy marched up to the inn door  leading the  black mare  and calling  ostler  most lustily  his call being answered  for  the beast    the man  next demanded attention  and the landlord  wondered all the wonders he could cram into a short speech  at seeing  misther murphy  sure  at such a time  and the sonsy landlady  too   was all lamentations for his illigant coat and his poor eye  sure  all  ruined with the mud   and what was it at all  an upset  was it  oh   wirra  and wasn t it lucky he wasn t killed  and they without a spare  bed to lay him out dacent if he was  sure  wouldn t it be horrid for his  body to be only on sthraw in the barn  instead of the best feather bed  in the house  and  indeed  he d be welcome to it  only the gintlemen  from town had them all engaged      well  dead or alive  i must stay here to night  mrs  kelly  at all  events       and what will you do for a bed       a shake down in the parlour  or a stretch on a sofa  will do  my gig is  stuck fast in a ditch  my mare tired  ten miles from home  cold night   and my knee hurt   murphy limped as he spoke      oh  your poor knee   said mrs  kelly   i ll put a dhrop o  whisky and  brown paper on it  sure        and what gentlemen are these  mrs  kelly  who have so filled your  house       gintlemen that came by the coach a while agone  and supping in the  parlour now  sure       would you give my compliments  and ask would they allow me  under the  present peculiar circumstances  to join them  and in the meantime  send  somebody down the road to take the cushions out of my gig  for there is  no use in attempting to get the gig out till morning       sartinly  misther murphy  we ll send for the cushions  but as for the  gentlemen  they are all on the other side       what other side       the honourable s voters  sure       pooh  is that all   said murphy    i don t mind that  i ve no objection  on that account  besides   they  need not know who  i  am   and he gave  the landlord a knowing wink  to which the landlord as knowingly returned  another     the message to the gentlemen was delivered  and murphy was immediately  requested to join their party  this was all he wanted  and he played off  his powers of diversion on the innocent citizens so successfully  that  before supper was half over they thought themselves in luck to have  fallen in with such a chance acquaintance  murphy fired away jokes   repartees  anecdotes  and country gossip  to their delight  and when the  eatables were disposed of  he started them on the punch drinking tack  afterwards so cleverly  that he hoped to see three parts of them tipsy  before they retired to rest      do you feel your knee better now  sir   asked one of the party  of  murphy      considerably  thank you  whisky punch  sir  is about the best cure for  bruises or dislocations a man can take       i doubt that  sir   said a little matter of fact man  who had now  interposed his reasonable doubts for the twentieth time during murphy s  various extravagant declarations  and the interruption only made murphy  romance the more       you  speak of your fiery  dublin  stuff  sir  but our country whisky  is as mild as milk  and far more wholesome  then  sir  our fine air  alone would cure half the complaints without a grain of physic       i doubt that  sir   said the little man      i assure you  sir  a friend of my own from town came down here last  spring on crutches  and from merely following a light whisky diet and  sleeping with his window open  he was able to dance at the race ball in  a fortnight  as for this knee of mine  it s a trifle  though it was a  bad upset too       how did it happen  sir  was it your horse  or your harness  or your  gig  or        none o  them  sir  it was a  banshee        a banshee   said the little man   what s that       a peculiar sort of supernatural creature that is common here  sir  she  was squatted down on one side of the road  and my mare shied at her   and being a spirited little thing  she attempted to jump the ditch and  missed it in the dark       jump a ditch  with a gig after her  sir   said the little man      oh  common enough to do that here  sir  she d have done it easy in the  daylight  but she could not measure her distance in the dark  and bang  she went into the ditch  but it s a trifle  after all  i am generally  run over four or five times a year       and you alive to tell it   said the little man  incredulously      it s hard to kill us here  sir  we are used to accidents       well  the worst accident i ever heard of   said one of the citizens    happened to a friend of mine  who went to visit a friend of his on a  sunday  and all the family happened to be at church  so on driving into  the yard there was no one to take his horse  therefore he undertook  the office of ostler himself  but being unused to the duty  he most  incautiously took off the horse s bridle before unyoking him from his  gig  and the animal  making a furious plunge forward  my friend being  before him at the time  the shaft of the gig was driven through his  body  and into the coach house gate behind him  and stuck so fast that  the horse could not drag it out after  and in this dreadful situation  they remained until the family returned from church  and saw the awful  occurrence  a servant was despatched for a doctor  and the shaft was  disengaged  and drawn out of the man s body  just at the pit of the  stomach  he was laid on a bed  and every one thought of course he must  die at once  but he didn t  and the doctor came next day  and he wasn t  dead  did what he could for him  and  to make a long story short  sir   the man recovered       pooh  pooh   said the diminutive doubter      it s true   said the narrator      i make no doubt of it  sir   said murphy   i know a more extraordinary  case of recovery myself       i beg your pardon  sir   said the cit   i have not finished my story  yet  for the most extraordinary part of the story remains to be told   my friend  sir  was a very sickly man before the accident happened  a   very  sickly man  and after that accident he became a hale healthy man   what do you think of that  sir       it does not surprise me in the least  sir   said murphy   i can account  for it readily       well  sir  i never heard it accounted for  though i know it to be true   i should like to hear how you account for it       very simply  sir   said murphy   don t you perceive the man discovered  a  mine  of health by a  shaft  being sunk in the  pit  of his stomach      murphy s punning solution of the cause of cure was merrily received by  the company  whose critical taste was not of that affected nature  which despises  jeu de mots   and  will not  be satisfied under a  jeu  d esprit   the little doubting man alone refused to be pleased      i doubt the value of a pun always  sir  dr  johnson said  sir        i know   said murphy   that the man who would make a pun would pick  a pocket  that s old  sir   but is dearly remembered by all those who  cannot make puns themselves       exactly   said one of the party they called wiggins   it is the old  story of the fox and the grapes  did you ever hear  sir  the story of  the fox and the grapes  the fox one day was        yes  yes   said murphy  who  fond of absurdity as he was  could  not   stand the fox and the grapes by way of something new      they re sour  said the fox       yes   said murphy   a capital story       oh  them fables is so good   said wiggins      all nonsense   said the diminutive contradictor      nonsense  nothing but nonsense  the ridiculous stuff of birds and  beasts speaking  as if any one could believe such stuff       i do  firmly  for one   said murphy      you do   said the little man      i do  and do you know why       i cannot indeed conceive   said the little man  with a bitter grin      it is  sir  because i myself know a case that occurred in this very  country of a similar nature       do you want to make me believe you knew a fox that spoke  sir   said  the mannikin  almost rising into anger      many  sir   said murphy   many       well  after that   said the little man      but the case i immediately allude to is not of a fox  but a cat   said  murphy      a cat  oh  yes  to be sure  a cat speak  indeed   said the little  gentleman      it is a fact  sir   said murphy   and if the company would not object  to my relating the story  i will state the particulars      the proposal was received with acclamation  and murphy  in great  enjoyment of the little man s annoyance  cleared his throat  and made  all the preparatory demonstrations of a regular  raconteur   but  before  he began  he recommended the gentlemen to mix fresh tumblers all round  that they might have nothing to do but listen and drink silently   for  of all things in the world   said murtough   i hate a song or a story to  be interrupted by the rattle of spoons      they obeyed  and while they are mixing their punch  we will just turn  over a fresh page  and devote a new chapter to the following    marvellous legend          chapter xxiii    murtough murphy s story  being ye marvellous legend of tom connor s cat       there was a man in these parts  sir  you must know  called tom connor   and he had a cat that was equal to any dozen of rat traps  and he was  proud of the baste  and with rayson  for she was worth her weight in  goold to him in saving his sacks of meal from the thievery of the rats  and mice  for tom was an extensive dealer in corn  and influenced the  rise and fall of that article in the market  to the extent of a full  dozen of sacks at a time  which he either kept or sold  as the spirit  of free trade or monopoly came over him  indeed  at one time  tom had  serious thoughts of applying to the government for a military force to  protect his granary when there was a threatened famine in the county       pooh  pooh  sir   said the matter of fact little man   as if a dozen  sacks could be of the smallest consequence in a whole county  pooh   pooh       well  sir   said murphy   i can t help if you don t believe  but it s  truth what i am telling you  and pray don t interrupt me  though you  may not believe  by the time the story s done you ll have heard more  wonderful things than  that    and besides  remember you re a stranger  in these parts  and have no notion of the extraordinary things   physical  metaphysical  and magical  which constitute the idiosyncrasy  of rural destiny      the little man did not know the meaning of murphy s last sentence  nor  murphy either  but  having stopped the little man s throat with big  words  he proceeded       this cat  sir  you must know  was a great pet  and was so up to  everything  that tom swore she was a most like a christian  only she  couldn t speak  and had so sensible a look in her eyes  that he was  sartin sure the cat knew every word that was said to her  well  she used  to sit by him at breakfast every morning  and the eloquent cock of her  tail  as she used to rub against his leg  said   give me some milk  tom  connor   as plain as print  and the plenitude of her purr afterwards  spoke a gratitude beyond language  well  one morning  tom was going to  the neighbouring town to market  and he had promised the wife to bring  home shoes to the childre  out o  the price of the corn  and sure  enough  before he sat down to breakfast  there was tom taking the  measure of the children s feet  by cutting notches on a bit of stick   and the wife gave him so many cautions about getting a  nate fit  for   billy s purty feet   that tom  in his anxiety to nick the closest  possible measure  cut off the child s toe  that disturbed the harmony of  the party  and tom was obliged to breakfast alone  while the mother was  endeavouring to cure billy  in short  trying to make a  heal  of his   toe   well  sir  all the time tom was taking measure for the shoes  the  cat was observing him with that luminous peculiarity of eye for which  her tribe is remarkable  and when tom sat down to breakfast the cat  rubbed up against him more vigorously than usual  but tom  being  bewildered between his expected gain in corn and the positive loss of  his child s toe  kept never minding her  until the cat  with a sort of  caterwauling growl  gave tom a dab of her claws  that went clean through  his leathers  and a little further   wow   says tom  with a jump   clapping his hand on the part  and rubbing it   by this and that   you drew the blood out o  me   says tom   you wicked divil  tish   go  along   says he  making a kick at her  with that the cat gave a  reproachful look at him  and her eyes glared just like a pair of  mail coach lamps in a fog  with that  sir  the cat  with a mysterious    mi ow   fixed a most penetrating glance on tom  and distinctly uttered  his name      tom felt every hair on his head as stiff as a pump handle  and scarcely  crediting his ears  he returned a searching look at the cat  who very  quietly proceeded in a sort of nasal twang        tom connor   says she       the lord be good to me   says tom   if it isn t spakin  she is        tom connor   says she again       yes  ma am   says tom       come here   says she   whisper  i want to talk to you  tom   says  she   the laste taste in private   says she  rising on her hams  and  beckoning him with her paw out o  the door  with a wink and a toss o   the head aiqual to a milliner      well  as you may suppose  tom didn t know whether he was on his head  or his heels  but he followed the cat  and off she went and squatted  herself under the edge of a little paddock at the back of tom s house   and as he came round the corner  she held up her paw again  and laid it  on her mouth  as much as to say   be cautious  tom   well  divil a word  tom could say at all  with the fright  so up he goes to the cat  and  says she        tom   says she   i have a great respect for you  and there s something  i must tell you  becase you re losing character with your neighbours    says she   by your goin s on   says she   and it s out o  the respect  that i have for you  that i must tell you   says she       thank you  ma am   says tom       you re goin  off to the town   says she   to buy shoes for the  childre    says she   and never thought o  gettin  me a pair        you   says tom        yis  me  tom connor   says she   and the neighbours wondhers that  a respectable man like you allows your cat to go about the counthry  barefutted   says she        is it a cat to ware shoes   says tom        why not   says she   doesn t horses ware shoes   and i have a prettier  foot than a horse  i hope   says she  with a toss of her head        faix  she spakes like a woman  so proud of her feet   says tom to  himself  astonished  as you may suppose  but pretending never to think  it remarkable all the time  and so he went on discoursin   and says he    it s thrue for you  ma am   says he   that horses wares shoes  but that  stands to rayson  ma am  you see  seeing the hardship their feet has to  go through on the hard roads         and how do you know what hardship my feet has to go through   says the  cat  mighty sharp        but  ma am   says tom   i don t well see how you could fasten a shoe  on you   says he        lave that to me   says the cat        did any one ever stick walnut shells on you  pussy   says tom  with a  grin        don t be disrespectful  tom connor   says the cat  with a frown        i ax your pard n  ma am   says he   but as for the horses you wor  spakin  about wearin  shoes  you know their shoes is fastened on with  nails  and how would your shoes be fastened on         ah  you stupid thief   says she   haven t i illigant nails o  my own    and with that she gave him a dab of her claw  that made him roar        ow  murdher   says he        now  no more of your palaver  misther connor   says the cat   just be  off and get me the shoes         tare an  ouns   says tom   what ll become o  me if i m to get shoes  for my cats   says he   for you increase your family four times a year   and you have six or seven every time   says he   and then you must all  have two pair a piece  wirra  wirra   i ll be ruined in shoe leather    says tom       no more o  your stuff   says the cat   don t be stand in  here undher  the hedge talkin   or we ll lose our karacthers  for i ve remarked your  wife is jealous  tom        pon my sowl  that s thrue   says tom  with a smirk       more fool she   says the cat   for   pon my conscience  tom  you re as  ugly as if you wor bespoke       off ran the cat with these words  leaving tom in amazement  he said  nothing to the family  for fear of fright ning them  and off he went to  the  town  as he  pretended   for he saw the cat watching him through  a hole in the hedge  but when he came to a turn at the end of the road   the dickings a mind he minded the market  good or bad  but went off to  squire botherum s  the magisthrit  to sware examinations agen the cat       pooh  pooh   nonsense    broke in the little man  who had listened thus  far to murtough with an expression of mingled wonder and contempt   while the rest of the party willingly gave up the reins to nonsense   and enjoyed murtough s legend and their companion s more absurd common  sense      don t interrupt him  goggins   said mister wiggins      how can you listen to such nonsense   returned goggins   swear  examinations against a cat  indeed  pooh  pooh       my dear sir   said murtough   remember this is a fair story  and that  the country all around here is full of enchantment  as i was telling  you  tom went off to swear examinations       ay  ay   shouted all but goggins   go on with the story       and when tom was asked to relate the events of the morning  which  brought him before squire botherum  his brain was so bewildered between  his corn  and his cat  and his child s toe  that he made a very confused  account of it       begin your story from the beginning   said the magistrate to tom       well  your honour   says tom   i was goin  to market this mornin   to  sell the child s corn  i beg your pard n  my own toes  i mane  sir        sell your toes   said the squire       no  sir  takin  the cat to market  i mane         take a cat to market   said the squire   you re drunk  man        no  your honour  only confused a little  for when the toes began to  spake to me  the cat  i mane  i was bothered clane         the cat speak to you   said the squire   phew  worse than  before  you re drunk  tom        no  your honour  it s on the strength of the cat i come to spake to  you         i think it s on the strength of a pint of whisky  tom         by the vartue o  my oath  your honour  it s nothin  but the cat   and  so tom then told him all about the affair  and the squire was regularly  astonished  just then the bishop of the diocese and the priest of the  parish happened to call in  and heard the story  and the bishop and the  priest had a tough argument for two hours on the subject  the former  swearing she must be a witch  but the priest denying  that   and  maintaining she was  only  enchanted  and that part of the argument was  afterwards referred to the primate  and subsequently to the conclave at  rome  but the pope declined interfering about cats  saying he had quite  enough to do minding his own bulls       in the meantime  what are we to do with the cat   says botherum       burn her   says the bishop   she s a witch        only  enchanted   said the priest   and the ecclesiastical court  maintains that         bother the ecclesiastical court   said the magistrate   i can only  proceed on the statutes   and with that he pulled down all the law books  in his library  and hunted the laws from queen elizabeth down  and he  found that they made laws against everything in ireland   except a cat    the devil a thing escaped them but a cat  which did  not  come within  the meaning of any act of parliament    the cats only had escaped        there s the alien act  to be sure   said the magistrate   and perhaps  she s a french spy  in disguise        she spakes like a french spy  sure enough   says tom   and she was  missin   i remember  all last spy wednesday        that s suspicious   says the squire   but conviction might be  difficult  and i have a fresh idea   says botherum        faith  it won t keep fresh long  this hot weather   says tom   so  your honour had betther make use of it at wanst        right   says botherum    we ll make her subject to the game laws   we ll hunt her   says he       ow   elegant   says tom    we ll have a brave run out of her        meet me at the cross roads   says the squire   in the morning  and  i ll have the hounds ready        well  off tom went home  and he was racking his brain what excuse he  could make to the cat for not bringing the shoes  and at last he hit one  off  just as he saw her cantering up to him  half a mile before he got  home       where s the shoes  tom   says she       i have not got them to day  ma am   says he       is that the way you keep your promise  tom   says she    i ll tell you  what it is  tom  i ll tare the eyes out o  the childre  if you don t get  me shoes        whisht  whisht   says tom  frightened out of his life for his  children s eyes   don t be in a passion  pussy  the shoemaker said he  had not a shoe in his shop  nor a last that would make one to fit  you  and he says  i must bring you into the town for him to take your  measure        and when am i to go   says the cat  looking savage       to morrow   says tom       it s well you said that  tom   said the cat   or the devil an eye i d  leave in your family this night   and off she hopped      tom thrimbled at the wicked look she gave       remember   says she  over the hedge  with a bitter caterwaul       never fear   says tom  well  sure enough  the next mornin  there was  the cat at cock crow  licking herself as nate as a new pin  to go into  the town  and out came tom with a bag undher his arm  and the cat afther  him       now git into this  and i ll carry you into the town   says tom   opening the bag       sure i can walk with you   says the cat       oh  that wouldn t do   says tom   the people in the town is curious  and slandherous people  and sure it would rise ugly remarks if i was  seen with a cat afther me   a dog is a man s companion by nature  but  cats does not stand to rayson       well  the cat  seeing there was no use in argument  got into the bag   and off tom set to the cross roads with the bag over his shoulder  and  he came up   quite innocent like   to the corner  where the squire  and  his huntsman  and the hounds  and a pack o  people were waitin   out  came the squire on a sudden  just as if it was all by accident       god save you  tom   says he       god save you kindly  sir   says tom       what s that bag you have at your back   says the squire       oh  nothin  at all  sir   says tom  makin  a face all the time  as  much as to say  i have her safe       oh  there s something in that bag  i think   says the squire   and you  must let me see it        if you bethray me  tom connor   says the cat in a low voice   by this  and that i ll never spake to you again        pon my honour  sir   said tom  with a wink and a twitch of his thumb  towards the bag   i haven t anything in it        i have been missing my praties of late   says the squire   and i d  just like to examine that bag   says he       is it doubting my charackther you d be  sir   says tom  pretending to  be in a passion       tom  your sowl   says the voice in the sack    if you let the cat out  of the bag   i ll murther you        an honest man would make no objection to be sarched   said the  squire   and i insist on it   says he  laying hold o  the bag  and tom  purtending to fight all the time  but  my jewel  before two minutes   they shook the cat out o  the bag  sure enough  and off she went with  her tail as big as a sweeping brush  and the squire  with a thundering  view halloo after her  clapt the dogs at her heels  and away they went  for the bare life  never was there seen such running as that day  the  cat made for a shaking bog  the loneliest place in the whole country   and there the riders were all thrown out  barrin  the huntsman  who had  a web footed horse on purpose for soft places  and the priest  whose  horse could go anywhere by reason of the priest s blessing  and  sure  enough  the huntsman and his riverence stuck to the hunt like wax  and  just as the cat got on the border of the bog  they saw her give a twist  as the foremost dog closed with her  for he gave her a nip in the flank   still she went on  however  and headed them well  towards an old mud  cabin in the middle of the bog  and there they saw her jump in at the  window  and up came the dogs the next minit  and gathered round  the house with the most horrid howling ever was heard  the huntsman  alighted  and went into the house to turn the cat out again  when what  should he see but an old hag lying in bed in the corner       did you see a cat come in here   says he       oh  no  o  o  o   squealed the old hag  in a trembling voice   there s  no cat here   says she       yelp  yelp  yelp   went the dogs outside       oh  keep the dogs out o  this   says the old hag   oh  o  o  o   and  the huntsman saw her eyes glare under the blanket  just like a cat s       hillo   says the huntsman  pulling down the blanket  and what should  he see but the old hag s flank all in a gore of blood       ow  ow  you old divil  is it you  you ould cat   says he  opening the  door      in rushed the dogs  up jumped the old hag  and changing into a cat  before their eyes  out she darted through the window again  and made  another run for it  but she couldn t escape  and the dogs gobbled her  while you could say  jack robinson   but the most remarkable part of  this extraordinary story  gentlemen  is  that the pack was ruined from  that day out  for after having eaten the enchanted cat   the devil a  thing they would ever hunt afterwards but mice             chapter xxiv      murphy s story was received with acclamation by all but the little man      that is all a pack of nonsense   said he      well  you re welcome to it  sir   said murphy   and if i had greater  nonsense you should have it  but seriously  sir  i again must beg you  to remember that the country all around here abounds in enchantment   scarcely a night passes without some fairy frolic  but  however you  may doubt the wonderful fact of the cat speaking  i wonder you are not  impressed with the points of moral in which the story abounds        fiddlestick   said the miniature snarler      first  the little touch about the corn monopoly      then maternal  vanity chastised by the loss of the child s toe  then tom s familiarity  with his cat  showing the danger arising from a man making too free with  his female domestics  the historical point about the penal laws  the  fatal results of letting the cat out o  the bag  with the curious final  fact in natural history          footnote  handy andy was written when the  vexed question  of the   corn laws  was the all absorbing subject of discussion       it s all nonsense   said the little man   and i am ashamed of myself  for being such a fool as to sit  alistening to such stuff instead of  going to bed  after the fatigue of my journey and the necessity of  rising early to morrow  to be in good time at the polling       oh  then you re going to the election  sir   said murphy      yes  sir  there s some sense in  that   and  you   gentlemen  remember  we must be  all  up early  and i recommend you to follow my example      the little man rang the bell  the bootjack and slippers were called for   and  after some delay  a very sleepy looking  gossoon  entered with a  bootjack under his arm  but no slippers      didn t i say slippers   said the little man      you did  sir       where are they  sir       the masther says there isn t any  if you plaze  sir       no slippers  and you call this an inn  oh   well   what can t be cured  must be endured   hold me the bootjack  sir      the gossoon obeyed  the little man inserted his heel in the cleft  but   on attempting to pull his foot from the boot  he nearly went heels over  head backward  murphy caught him and put him on his legs again   heads  up  soldiers   exclaimed murtough   i thought you were drinking too  much       sir  i m not intoxicated   said the mannikin  snappishly   it is the  fault of that vile bootjack  what sort of a thing is that you have  brought   added he in a rage to the  gossoon       it s the bootjack  sir  only one o  the horns is gone  you see   and he  held up to view a rough piece of board with an angular slit in it  but  one of  the horns   as he called it  had been broken off at the top   leaving the article useless      how dare you bring such a thing as  that    said the little man  in a  great rage      why  sir  you ax d for a bootjack  sure  and i brought you the best i  had  and it s not my fault it s bruk  so it is  for it wasn t me bruk  it  but biddy batin  the cock       beating the cock   repeated the little man in surprise   bless me  beat  a cock with a bootjack   what savages       oh  it s not the  hen  cock i mane  sir   said the gossoon   but  the beer cock  she was batin  the cock into the barrel  sir  wid the  bootjack  sir       that was decidedly wrong   said murphy   a bootjack is better suited to  a heel tap than a full measure       she was tapping the beer  you mean   said the little man      faix  she wasn t tapping it at all  sir  but hittin  it very hard  she  was  and that s the way she bruk it       barbarians   exclaimed the little man   using a bootjack instead of a  hammer       sure the hammer was gone to the priest  sir  bekase he wanted it for  the crucifixion       the crucifixion   exclaimed the little man  horrified   is it possible  they crucify people       oh no  sir   said the gossoon  grinning   it s the picthure i main   sir  an illigant picthure that is hung up in the chapel  and he wanted a  hammer to dhrive the nails        oh  a  picture  of the crucifixion   said the little man      yes  sure  sir  the alther piece  that was althered for to fit to the  place  for it was too big when it came down from dublin  so they cut  off the sides where the sojers was  bekase it stopt out the windows  and  wouldn t lave a bit o  light for his riverence to read mass  and sure  the sojers were no loss out o  the alther piece  and was hung up afther  in the vesthery  and serve them right  the blackguards  but it was sore  agen our will to cut off the ladies at the bottom  that was cryin   and roarin   but great good luck  the head o  the blessed virgin was  presarved in the corner  and sure it s beautiful to see the tears  runnin  down her face  just over the hole in the wall for the holy  wather  which is remarkable      the gossoon was much offended by the laughter that followed his account  of the altar piece  which he had no intention of making irreverential   and suddenly became silent  with a muttered  more shame for yiz   and  as his bootjack was impracticable  he was sent off with orders for the  chamber maid to supply bed candles immediately     the party soon separated for their various dormitories  the little man  leaving sundry charges to call them early in the morning  and to be sure  to have hot water ready for shaving  and  without fail  to have their  boots polished in time and left at their room doors   to all which  injunctions he severally received the answer of   certainly  sir   and  as the bed room doors were slapped to  one by one  the last sound of the  retiring party was the snappish voice of the indefatigable little man   shouting  ere he shut his door    early  early  don t forget  mistress  kelly   early       a shake down for murphy in the parlour was hastily prepared  and after  mrs  kelly was assured by murtough that he was quite comfortable  and  perfectly content with his accommodation  for which she made scores  of apologies  with lamentations it was not better   c    c   the whole  household retired to rest  and in about a quarter of an hour the inn was  in perfect silence     then murtough cautiously opened his door  and after listening for some  minutes  and being satisfied he was the only watcher under the roof   he gently opened one of the parlour windows and gave the preconcerted  signal which he and dick had agreed upon  dick was under the window  immediately  and after exchanging a few words with murtough  the latter  withdrew  and taking off his boots  and screening with his hand the  light of a candle he carried  he cautiously ascended the stairs  and  proceeded stealthily along the corridor of the dormitory  where  from  the chambers on each side  a concert of snoring began to be executed   and at all the doors stood the boots and shoes of the inmates  awaiting the aid of day and martin in the morning  but  oh  innocent  calf skins  destined to a far different fate  not day and martin  but  dick the devil and company are in wait for you  murphy collected as many  as he could carry under his arms and descended with them to the parlour  window  where they were transferred to dick  who carried them directly  to the horse pond which lay behind the inn  and there committed them to  the deep  after a few journeys up and down stairs  murtough had left the  electors without a morsel of sole or upper leather  and was satisfied  that a considerable delay  if not a prevention of their appearance at  the poll on the morrow  would be the consequence      there  dick   said murphy   is the last of them   as he handed the  little man s shoes out of the window    and now  to save appearances   you must take mine too  for i must be without boots as well as the rest  in the morning  what fun i shall have when the uproar begins  don t you  envy me  dick  there  be off now  but hark  e  notwithstanding you take  away my boots  you need not throw them into the horse pond        faith  an  i will   said dick  dragging them out of his hands    t  would not be honourable  if i didn t  i d give two pair of boots for the  fun you ll have       nonsense  dick  dick  i say  my boots       honour   cried dick  as he vanished round the corner      that devil will keep his word   muttered murphy  as he closed the  window   i may bid good bye to that pair of boots  bad luck to him    and yet the merry attorney could not help laughing at dick making him a  sufferer by his own trick     dick  did  keep his word  and after  with particular delight  sinking  murphy s boots with the rest  he  as it was preconcerted  returned to  the cottage of barny  and with his assistance drew the upset gig from  the ditch  and with a second set of harness  provided for the occasion   yoked the servant s horse to the vehicle and drove home     murphy  meanwhile  was bent on more mischief at the inn  and lest  the loss of the boots and shoes might not be productive of sufficient  impediment to the movements of the enemy  he determined on venturing  a step further  the heavy sleeping of the weary and tipsy travellers  enabled him to enter their chambers unobserved  and over the garments  they had taken off he poured the contents of the water jug and  water bottle he found in each room  and then laying the empty bottle and  a tumbler on a chair beside each sleeper s bed  he made it appear as if  the drunken men had been dry in the night  and  in their endeavours  to cool their thirst  had upset the water over their own clothes  the  clothes of the little man  in particular  murphy took especial delight  in sousing more profusely than his neighbour s  and not content with  taking his shoes  burnt his stockings  and left the ashes in the dish  of the candlestick  with just as much unconsumed as would show what  they had been  he then retired to the parlour  and with many an internal  chuckle at the thought of the morning s hubbub  threw off his clothes  and flinging himself on the shake down mrs  kelly had provided for him   was soon wrapt in the profoundest slumber  from which he never awoke  until the morning uproar of the inn aroused him  he jumped from his  lair and rushed to the scene of action  to soar in the storm of his  own raising  and to make it more apparent that he had been as great a  sufferer as the rest  he only threw a quilt over his shoulders and  did not draw on his stockings  in this plight he scaled the stairs and  joined the storming party  where the little man was leading the forlorn  hope  with his candlestick in one hand and the remnant of his burnt  stocking between the finger and thumb of the other      look at that  sir   he cried  as he held it up to the landlord     the landlord could only stare      bless me   cried murphy   how drunk you must have been to mistake your  stocking for an extinguisher       drunk  sir  i wasn t drunk       it looks very like it   said murphy  who did not wait for an answer   but bustled off to another party who was wringing out his inexpressibles  at the door of his bed room  and swearing at the gossoon that he  must   have his boots      i never seen them  sir   said the boy      i left them at my door   said the man      so did i leave mine   said murphy   and here i am barefooted  it is  most extraordinary       has the house been robbed   said the innocent elector      not a one o  me knows  sir   said the boy   but how could it be robbed  and the doors all fast this mornin       the landlady now appeared  and fired at the word  robbed       robbed  sir   exclaimed mrs  kelly   no  sir  no one was ever robbed  in my house  my house is respectable and responsible  sir  a vartuous  house  none o  your rantipole places  sir  i d have you to know  but  decent and well behaved  and the house was as quiet as a lamb all  night       certainly  mrs  kelly   said murphy   not a more respectable house in  ireland  i ll vouch for that       you re a gentleman  misther murphy   said mrs  kelly  who turned down  the passage  uttering indignant ejaculations in a sort of snorting  manner  while her words of anger were returned by murphy with  expressions of soothing and condolence as he followed her down stairs     the storm still continued above  and while there they shouted and swore  and complained  murphy gave  his  notion of the catastrophe to the  landlady below  inferring that the men were drunk and poured the  water over their own clothes  to repeat this idea to themselves he  re ascended  but the men were incredulous  the little man he found  buttoning on a pair of black gaiters  the only serviceable decency  he had at his command  which only rendered his denuded state more  ludicrous  to him murphy asserted his belief that the whole affair was  enchantment  and ventured to hope the small individual would have more  faith in fairy machinations for the future  to which the little abortion  only returned his usual  pho  pho  nonsense      through all this scene of uproar  as murphy passed to and fro  whenever  he encountered the landlord  that worthy individual threw him a knowing  look  and the exclamation of   oh  misther murphy  by dad   given in  a low chuckling tone  insinuated that the landlord not only smoked but  enjoyed the joke      you must lend me a pair of boots  kelly   said murtough      to be sure  sir  ha  ha  ha   but you are the quare man  misther  murphy        send down the road and get my gig out of the ditch       to be sure  sir  poor devils  purty hands they got into   and off went  the landlord  with a chuckle     the messengers sent for the gig returned  declaring there was no gig to  be seen anywhere     murphy affected great surprise at the intelligence  again went among  the bamboozled electors  who were all obliged to go to bed for want of  clothes  and his bitter lamentations over the loss of his gig almost  reconciled them to their minor troubles     to the fears they expressed that they should not be able to reach the  town in time for polling that day  murphy told them to set their minds  at rest  for they would be in time on the next     he then borrowed a saddle as well as the pair of boots from the  landlord  and the little black mare bore murphy triumphantly back to the  town  after he had securely impounded scatterbrain s voters  who were  anxiously and hourly expected by their friends  still they came not   at last  handy andy  who happened to be in town with scatterbrain  was  despatched to hurry them  and his orders were not to come back without  them     handy  on his arrival at the inn  found the electors in bed  and all  the fires in the house employed in drying their clothes  the little man   wrapped in a blanket  was superintending the cooking of his own  before the kitchen grate  there hung his garments on some cross sticks  suspended by a string  after the fashion of a roasting jack  which  the small gentleman turned before a blazing turf fire  and beside  this contrivance of his swung a goodly joint of meat  which a bouncing  kitchen wench came over to baste now and then     andy was answering some questions of the inquisitive little man  when  the kitchen maid  handing the basting ladle to andy  begged him to do  a good turn and just to baste the beef for her  for that her heart was  broke with all she had to do  cooking dinner for so many     andy  always ready to oblige  consented  and plied the ladle actively  between the troublesome queries of the little man  but at last  getting  confused with some very crabbed questions put to him  andy became  completely bothered  and lifting a brimming ladle of dripping  poured it  over the little man s coat instead of the beef     a roar from the proprietor of the clothes followed  and he implanted  a kick at such advantage upon andy  that he upset him into the  dripping pan  and andy  in his fall  endeavouring to support himself   caught at the suspended articles above him  and the clothes  and the  beef  and andy  all swam in gravy      illustration  andy s cooking extraordinary           chapter xxv      while disaster and hubbub were rife below  the electors up stairs  were holding a council whether it would not be better to send back the   honourable s  messenger to the town and request a supply of shoes   which they had no other means of getting  the debate was of an odd sort   they were all in their several beds at the time  and roared at each  other through their doors  which were purposely left open that they  might enjoy each other s conversation  number seven replied to number  three  and claimed respect to his arguments on the score of seniority   the blue room was completely controverted by the yellow  and the  double bedded room would  of course  have had superior weight in the  argument  only that everything it said was lost by the two honourable  members speaking together  the french king used to hold a council called  a  bed of justice   in which neither justice nor a bed had anything to  do  so that this irish conference better deserved the title than any  council the bourbon ever assembled  the debate having concluded  and the  question being put and carried  the usher of the black counterpane was  desired to get out of bed  and  wrapped in the robe of office whence  he derived his title  to go down stairs and call the  honourable s   messenger to the  bar of the house   and there order him a pint of  porter  for refreshment after his ride  and forthwith to send him back  again to the town for a supply of shoes     the house was unanimous in voting the supplies  the usher reached the  kitchen and found andy in his shirt sleeves  scraping the dripping from  his livery with an old knife  whose hackled edge considerably assisted  andy s own ingenuity in the tearing of his coat in many places  while  the little man made no effort towards the repair of his garment  but  held it up before him  and regarded it with a piteous look     to the usher of the black counterpane s question  whether andy was the   honourable s messenger   andy replied in the affirmative  but to the  desire expressed  that he would ride back to the town  andy returned a  decided negative      my ordhers is not to go back without you   said andy      but we have no shoes   said the usher   and cannot go until we get  some       my ordher is not to go back without you       but if we can t go       well  then  i can t go back  that s all   said andy     the usher  the landlord  and the landlady all hammered away at andy for  a long time  in vain trying to convince him he ought to return  as he  was desired  still andy stuck to the letter of his orders  and said he  often got into trouble for not doing  exactly  what he was bid  and  that he was bid  not to go back without them  and he would not  so he  wouldn t  divil a fut      at last  however  andy was made to understand the propriety of riding  back to the town  and was desired to go as fast as his horse could carry  him  to gallop every foot of the way  but andy did no such thing  he had  received a good thrashing once for being caught galloping his master s  horse on the road  and he had no intention of running the risk a second  time  because   the stranger   told him to do so   what does he know  about it   said andy to himself    faith  it s fair and aisy i ll go   and not disthress the horse to plaze any one   so he went back his  ten miles at a reasonable pace only  and when he appeared without the  electors  a storm burst on poor andy      there  i knew how it would be   said he   and not my fault at all       weren t you told not to return without them       but wait till i tell you how it was  sure   and then andy began an  account of the condition in which the voters lay at the inn but between  the impatience of those who heard  and the confused manner of andy s  recital  it was some time before matters were explained  and then andy  was desired to ride back to the inn again  to tell the electors shoes  should be forwarded after him in a post chaise  and requesting their  utmost exertions in hastening over to the town  for that the election  was going against them  andy returned to the inn  and this time  under  orders from head quarters  galloped in good earnest  and brought in his  horse smoking hot  and indicating lameness  the day was wearing apace   and it was so late when the electors were enabled to start that the  polling booths were closed before they could leave the town  and in many  of these booths the requisite number of electors had not been polled  that day to keep them open  so that the next day nearly all those  outlying electors  about whom there had been so much trouble and  expense  would be of no avail  thus  murphy s trick was quite  successful  and the poor pickled electors were driven back to their inn  in dudgeon     andy  when he went to the stable to saddle his steed  for a return to  neck or nothing hall  found him dead lame  so that to ride him better  than twelve miles home was impossible  andy was obliged to leave him  where he was  and trudge it to the hall  for all the horses in kelly s  stables were knocked up with their day s work     as it was shorter by four miles across the country than by the road   andy pursued the former course  and as he knew the country well  the  shades of evening  which were now closing round  did not deter him in  the least  andy was not very fresh for the journey to be sure  for he  had ridden upwards of thirty miles that day  so the merry whistle  which  is so constantly heard from the lively irish pedestrian  did not while  away the tedium of his walk  it was night when andy was breasting up a  low ridge of hills  which lay between him and the end of his journey   and when in silence and darkness he topped the ascent  he threw himself  on some heather to rest and take breath  his attention was suddenly  caught by a small blue flame  which flickered now and then on the face  of the hill  not very far from him  and andy s fears of fairies and  goblins came crowding upon him thick and fast  he wished to rise  but  could not  his eye continued to be strained with the fascination of fear  in the direction he saw the fire  and sought to pierce the gloom through  which  at intervals  the small point of flame flashed brightly and sunk  again  making the darkness seem deeper  andy lay in perfect stillness   and in the silence  which was unbroken even by his own breathing  he  thought he heard voices underground  he trembled from head to foot   for he was certain they were the voices of the fairies  whom he firmly  believed to inhabit the hills      oh  murdher  what ll i do   thought andy to himself   sure i heerd  often  if once you were within the sound of their voices  you could  never get out o  their power  oh  if i could only say a  pather  and   ave   but i forget my prayers with the fright  hail  mary  the king  o  the fairies lives in these hills  i know  and his house is undher  me this minit  and i on the roof of it  i ll never get down again  i ll  never get down again  they ll make me slater to the fairies  and sure  enough i remember me  the hill is all covered with flat stones they call  fairy slates  oh  i am ruined  god be praised   here he blessed himself   and laid his head close to the earth   guardian angels  i hear their  voices singin  a dhrinking song  oh  if i had a dhrop o  water myself   for my mouth is as dhry as a lime burner s wig  and i on the top o   their house  see  there s the little blaze again  i wondher is their  chimbley afire  oh  murther  i ll die o  thirst  oh  if i had only  one dhrop o  wather  i wish it would rain or hail  hail  mary  full o   grace  whisht  what s that   andy crouched lower than before  as he saw  a figure rise from the earth  and attain a height which andy computed  to be something about twenty feet  his heart shrank to the size of a  nut shell  as he beheld the monster expand to his full dimensions  and  at the same moment  a second  equally large  emerged from the ground     now  as fairies are notoriously little people  andy changed his opinion  of the parties into whose power he had fallen  and saw clearly they were  giants  not fairies  of whom he was about to become the victim  he  would have ejaculated a prayer for mercy  had not terror rendered him  speechless  as the remembrance of all the giants he had ever heard of   from the days of jack and the bean stalk down  came into his head  but  though his sense of speaking was gone  that of hearing was painfully  acute  and he heard one of the giants say       that pot is not big enough       oh  it howlds as much as we want   replied the other      o lord   thought andy   they ve got their pot ready for cooking       what keeps him   said the first giant      oh  he s not far off   said the second     a clammy shivering came over andy      i m hungry   said the first  and he hiccupped as he spoke      it s only a false appetite you have   said the second   you re drunk      this was a new light to andy  for he thought giants were too strong to  get drunk   i could ate a young child  without parsley and butther    said the drunken giant  andy gave a faint spasmodic kick      and it s as hot as      down there   said the giant     andy trembled at the horrid word he heard      no wonder   said the second giant   for i can see the flame popping out  at the top of the chimbley  that s bad  i hope no one will see it  or  it might give them warning  bad luck to that young divil for making the  fire so sthrong      what a dreadful hearing this was for andy  young devils to make their  fires  there was no doubt what place they were dwelling in   thunder and  turf   said the drunken giant   i wish i had a slice of       andy did not hear what he wished a slice of  for the night wind  swept across the heath at the moment  and carried away the monster s  disgusting words on its pure breath      well  i d rather have    said the other giant  and again andy lost what  his atrocious desires were   than all the other slices in the world   what a lovely round shoulder she has  and the nice round ankle of her       the word  ankle  showed at once it was a woman of whom he spoke  and  andy shuddered   the monsters  to eat a woman       what a fool you are to be in love   said the drunken giant with several  hiccups  showing the increase of his inebriation      is that what the brutes call love   thought andy   to ate a woman       i wish she was bone of my bone and flesh of my flesh   said the second  giant  of this speech andy heard only  bone  and  flesh   and had great  difficulty in maintaining the serenity of his diaphragm     the conversation of the giants was now more frequently interrupted by  the wind which was rising  and only broken sentences reached andy  whose  senses became clearer the longer he remained in a state of safety   at last he heard the name of squire egan distinctly pass between the  giants      so they know squire egan   thought andy     the first giant gave a drunken laugh at the mention of squire egan s  name  and exclaimed       don t be afraid of him   hiccup    i have him undher my thumb    hiccup    i can crush him when i plase       o  my poor owld masther   mentally ejaculated andy     another break in their conversation occurred  and the next name andy  overheard was  o grady       the big bully   said the second giant      they know the whole country   thought andy      but tell me  what was that you said to him at the election   said the  drunken one     the word  election  recalled andy to the business of this earth back  again  and it struck upon his hitherto bewildered sensorium that giants  could have nothing to do with elections  and he knew he never saw  them there  and  as the thought struck him  it seemed as if the giants  diminished in size  and did not appear  quite  so big      sure you know   said the second      well  i d like to hear it again   said the drunken one   hiccup        the big bully says to me   have you a lease   says he   no   says i    but i have an article    what article   says he   it s a fine brass  blunderbuss   says i   and  i d like to see the man would dispute the  title        the drunken listener chuckled  and the words broke the spell of  supernatural terror which had hung over andy  he knew  by the words of  the speaker  it was the bully joker of the election was present   who browbeat o grady and out quibbled the agent about the oath of  allegiance  and the voice of the other he soon recognised for that of  larry hogan  so now his giants were diminished into mortal men  the pot   which had been mentioned to the terror of his soul  was for the making  of whisky instead of human broth  and the  hell  he thought his giants  inhabited was but a private still  andy felt as if a mountain had been  lifted from his heart when he found it was but mortals he had to deal  with  for andy was not deficient in courage when it was but thews  and sinews like his own he had to encounter  he still lay concealed   however  for smugglers might not wish their private haunt to be  discovered  and it was possible andy would be voted one too many in the  company should he announce himself  and with such odds as two to one  against him he thought he had better be quiet  besides  his curiosity  became excited when he found them speaking of his old master  egan  and  his present one  o grady  and as a woman had been alluded to  and odd  words caught up here and there  he became anxious to hear more of their  conversation      so you re in love   said larry  with a hiccup  to our friend of the  blunderbuss   ha  ha  ha  you big fool       well  you old thief  don t you like a purty girl yourself       i did  when i was young and foolish        faith  then  you re young and foolish at that rate yet  for you re a  rogue with the girls  larry   said the other  giving him a slap on the  back      not i  not i   said larry  in a manner expressive of his not being  displeased with the charge of gallantry   he  he  he   how do you know   eh     hiccup     sure  i know myself  but as i wos telling you  if i  could only lay howld of    here his voice became inaudible to andy  and  the rest of the sentence was lost     andy s curiosity was great   who could the girl be       and you d carry her off   said larry      i would   said the other   i m only afraid o  squire egan      at this announcement of the intention of  carrying her off   coupled  with the fear of  squire egan   andy s anxiety to hear the name of the  person became so intense that he crawled cautiously a little nearer to  the speakers      i tell you again   said larry   i can settle  him  aisy    hiccup    he s undher my thumb   hiccup         be aisy   said the other  contemptuously  who thought this was a mere  drunken delusion of larry s      i tell you i m his masther   said larry  with a drunken flourish of his  arm  and he continued bragging of his power over the squire in various  ejaculations  the exact meaning of which our friend of the blunderbuss  could not fathom  but andy heard enough to show him that the discovery  of the post office affair was what larry alluded to     that larry  a close  cunning  circumventing rascal  should so far betray  the source of his power over egan may seem strange  but be it remembered  larry was drunk  a state of weakness which his caution generally guarded  him from falling into  but which being in  his foible was bragging of  his influence  and so running the risk of losing it     the men continued to talk together for some time  and the tenour of the  conversation was  that larry assured his companion he might carry off  the girl without fear of egan  but her name andy could not discover  his  own name he heard more than once  and voluptuous raptures poured forth  about lovely lips and hips and ankles from the herculean knight of the  blunderbuss  amidst the maudlin admiration and hiccups of larry  who  continued to brag of his power  and profess his readiness to stand by  his friend in carrying off the girl      then   said the hercules  with an oath   i ll soon have you in my arms   my lovely       the name was lost again     their colloquy was now interrupted by the approach of a man and woman   the former being the person for whose appearance larry made so many  inquiries when he first appeared to andy as the hungry giant  the other  was the sister of the knight of the blunderbuss  larry having hiccupped  his anger against the man for making them wait so long for the bacon   the woman said he should not wait longer without his supper now   for that she would go down and fry the rashers immediately  she then  disappeared through the ground  and the men all followed     andy drew his breath freely once more  and with caution raised himself  gradually from the ground with a careful circumspection  lest any of the  subterranean community might be watchers on the hill  and when he was  satisfied he was free from observation  he stole away from the spot  with stealthy steps for about twenty paces  and there  as well as the  darkness would permit  after taking such landmarks as would help him to  retrace his way to the still  if requisite  he dashed down the hill at  the top of his speed  this pace he did not moderate until he had placed  nearly a mile between him and the scene of his adventure  he then paced  slowly to regain his breath  his head was in a strange whirl  mischief  was threatened against some one of whose name he was ignorant  squire  egan was declared to be in the power of an old rascal  this grieved andy  most of all  for he felt  he  was the cause of his old master s dilemma      oh  to think i should bring him into trouble   said andy   the kind  and good masther he was to me ever  and i live to tell it like a  blackguard  throth i d rather be hanged any day than the masther would  come to throuble  maybe if i gave myself up and was hanged like a man  at once  that would settle it   faith  if i thought it would  i d do it  sooner than squire egan should come to throuble   and poor andy spoke  just what he felt   or would it do to kill that blackguard hogan   sure  they could do no more than hang me afther   and that would save the  masther  and be all one to me  for they often towld me i d be hanged       but then there s my sowl   said andy  and he paused at the  thought     if they hanged me for the letthers  it would be only for a  mistake  and sure then i d have a chance o  glory  for sure i might go  to glory through a mistake  but if i killed a man on purpose  sure it  would be slappin  the gates of heaven in my own face  faix  i ll spake  to father blake about it              footnote  how often has the sanguinary penal code of past years  suggested this reflection and provoked the guilt it was meant to  awe  happily  now our laws are milder  and more protective from their  mildness          footnote  in the foregoing passage  andy stumbles on uttering a  quaint pleasantry  for it is partly true as well as droll  the notion of  a man gaining paradise through a mistake  our intentions too seldom lead  us there  but rather tend the other way  for a certain place is said  to be paved with  good  ones  and surely  bad  ones would not lead us  upwards  then the phrase of a man  slapping the gates of heaven in his  own face   is one of those wild poetic figures of speech in which  the irish peasantry often indulge  the phrase  slapping the door  is  every day and common  but when applied to  the gates of heaven   and   in a man s own face   the common phrase becomes fine  but how often  the commonest things become poetry by the fitness of their application   though poetasters and people of small minds think greatness of thought  lies in big words            chapter xxvi      the following day was that eventful one which should witness the return  of either edward egan  esq   or the honourable sackville scatterbrain as  member for the county  there was no doubt in any reasonable man s mind  as to the real majority of egan  but the numbers were sufficiently close  to give the sheriff an opportunity of doing a bit of business to  oblige his friends  and therefore he declared the honourable sackville  scatterbrain duly elected  great was the uproar  the people hissed   and hooted  and groaned  for which the honourable sackville very  good naturedly returned them his thanks  murphy snapped his fingers in  the sheriff s face  and told them his honourable friend should not long  remain member  for that he must be unseated on petition  and that he  would prove the return most corrupt  with which words he again snapped  his fingers in the sheriff s face     the sheriff threatened to read the riot act if such conduct was  repeated     egan took off his hat  and thanked him for his  honourable  upright   and impartial  conduct  whereupon all egan s friends took off their hats  also  and made profound bows to the functionary  and then laughed most  uproariously  counter laughs were returned from the opposite party  who  begged to remind the eganites of the old saying   that they might laugh  who win   a cross fire of sarcasms was kept up amidst the two parties  as they were crushing forward out of the courthouse  and at the door   before entering his carriage  scatterbrain very politely addressed egan   and trusted that  though they had met as rivals on the hustings  they  nevertheless parted friends  and expressing the highest respect for the  squire  offered his hand in amity     egan  equally good hearted as his opponent  shook his hand cordially   declaring he attributed to him none of the blame which attached to other  persons   besides  my dear sir   said egan  laughing   i should be a  very ill natured person to grudge you so small an indulgence as being  member of parliament  for a month or so       scatterbrain returned the laugh  good humouredly  and replied that   at  all events  he  had  the seat       yes  my dear sir   said egan   and make the most of it  while  you  have it  in short  i shall owe you an obligation when i go over to st   stephen s  for you will have just  aired my seat  for me  good bye      they parted with smiles  and drove to their respective homes  but as  even doubtful possession is preferable to expectation for the time  being  it is certain that neck or nothing hall rang with more merriment  that night on the reality of the present  than merryvale did on the hope  of the future     even o grady  as he lay with his wounded arm on the sofa  found more  healing in the triumph of the hour than from all the medicaments of the  foregoing week  and insisted on going down stairs and joining the party  at supper      gusty  dear   said his wife   you know the doctor said        hang the doctor       your arm  my love       i wish you d leave off pitying my arm  and have some compassion on my  stomach       the doctor said        there are oysters in the house  i ll do myself more good by the use of  an oyster knife than all the lancets in the college of surgeons       but your wound  dear       are they carlingfords or poldoodies       so fresh  love       so much the better       your wound i mean  dear       nicely opened       only dressed an hour ago       with some mustard  pepper  and vinegar       indeed  gusty  if you take my advice        i d rather have oysters any day      o grady sat up on the sofa as he spoke and requested his wife to say no  more about the matter  but put on his cravat  while she was getting it  from his wardrobe  his mind wandered from supper to the pension   which he looked upon as secure now that scatterbrain was returned  and  oyster banks gave place to the bank of ireland  which rose in a pleasing  image before o grady s imagination  the wife now returned with the  cravat  still dreading the result of eating to her husband  and her mind  occupied wholly with the thought of supper  while o grady was wrapt in  visions of a pension      you won t take it  gusty  dear   said his wife with all the insinuation  of manner she could command      won t i   faith   said o grady   maybe you think i don t want it       indeed  i don t  dear       are you mad  woman  is it taking leave of the few senses you ever had  you are        t won t agree with you       won t it  just wait till i m tried       well  love  how much do you expect to be allowed       why i can t expect much just yet  we must begin gently  feel the pulse  first  but i should hope  by way of start  that six or seven hundred        gracious heaven   exclaimed his wife  dropping the cravat from her  hands   what the devil is the woman shouting at   said o grady      six or seven hundred     exclaimed mrs  o grady   my dear  there s not  as much in the house       no  nor has not been for many a long day  i know that as well as you    said o grady   but i hope we shall get as much for all that       my dear  where could you get them   asked the wife  timidly  who began  to think his head was a little light      from the treasury  to be sure       the treasury  my dear   said the wife  still at fault   how could you  get oysters from the treasury       oysters   exclaimed o grady  whose turn it was now to wonder   who  talks of oysters       my dear  i thought you said you d eat six or seven hundred of oysters       pooh  pooh  woman  it is of the pension i m talking  six or seven  hundred pounds  pounds  cash  per annum  now i suppose you ll put on my  cravat  i think a man may be allowed to eat his supper who expects six  hundred a year      a great many people besides o grady order suppers  and dinners too  on  the expectation of less than six hundred a year  perhaps there is no  more active agent for sending people into the insolvent court than the  aforesaid   expectation       o grady went down stairs  and was heartily welcomed by scatterbrain on  his re appearance from his sick room  but mrs  o grady suggested that   for fear any excess would send him back there for a longer time  a  very moderate indulgence at the table should suffice  she begged the  honourable member to back her argument  which he did  and o grady  promised temperance  but begged the immediate appearance of the oysters   for he experienced that eager desire which delicate health so often  prompts for some particular food     andy was laying the table at the time  and was ordered to expedite  matters as much as possible      yis  ma am       you re sure the oysters are all good  andy       sartin  ma am       because the last oysters you know        oh  yis  ma am  were bad  ma am  bekase they had their mouths all open   i remember  ma am  but when i m towld a thing once  i never forget it  again  and you towld me when they opened their mouths once they were no  good  so you see  ma am  i ll never bring up bad oysthers again  ma am       very good  andy  and you have kept them in a cool place  i hope       faix  they re cowld enough where i put them  ma am       very well  bring them up at once      off went andy  and returned with all the haste he could with a large  dish heaped up with oysters     o grady rubbed his hands with the impatience of a true lover of the  crustaceous delicacy  and scatterbrain  eager to help him  flourished  his oyster knife  but before he had time to commence operations the  olfactory nerves of the company gave evidence that the oysters were  rather suspicious  every one began sniffing  and a universal  oh dear    ran round the table      don t you smell it  furlong   said scatterbrain  who was so lost in  looking at augusta s mustachios that he did not mind anything else      isn t it horrid   said o grady  with a look of disgust     furlong thought he alluded to the mustachio  and replied with an  assurance that he  liked it of all things       like it   said o grady   you ve a queer taste  what do  you  think of  it  miss   added he to augusta   it s just under your nose   furlong  thought this rather personal  even from a father      i ll try my knife on one   said scatterbrain  with a flourish of the  oyster knife  which furlong thought resembled the preliminary trial of a  barber s razor     furlong thought this worse than o grady  but he hesitated to reply to  his chief  and an  honourable  into the bargain     in the meantime  scatterbrain opened an oyster  which furlong  in his  embarrassment and annoyance  did not perceive      cut off the beard   said o grady   i don t like it      this nearly made furlong speak  but  considering o grady s temper  and ill health  he hesitated  till he saw augusta rubbing her eye  in  consequence of a small splinter of the oyster shell having struck it  from scatterbrain s mismanagement of his knife  but furlong thought she  was crying  and then he could be silent no longer  he went over to where  she sat  and with a very affectionate demonstration in his action  said    never mind them  dear gussy  never mind  don t cwy  i love her dear  little moustachios  i do   he gave a gentle pat on the back of the neck  as he spoke  and it was returned by an uncommonly smart box on the ear  from the young lady  and the whole party looked thunderstruck   dear  gussy  cried for spite  and stamped her way out of the room  followed by  furlong      let them go   said o grady   they ll make it up outside       these oysters are all bad   said scatterbrain     o grady began to swear at his disappointment  he had set his heart on  oysters  mrs  o grady rang the bell  andy appeared      how dare you bring up such oysters as these   roared o grady      the misthris ordhered them  sir       i told you never to bring up bad oysters   said she      them s not bad  ma am   said andy      have you a nose   says o grady      yes  sir       and can t you smell them  then       faix  i smelt them for the last three days  sir       and how could you say they were good  then   asked his mistress      sure you tould me  ma am  that if they didn t open their mouths they  were good  and i ll be on my book oath them oysters never opened their  mouths since i had them  for i laid them on a coolflag in the kitchen  and put the jack weight over them      notwithstanding o grady s rage  scatterbrain could not help roaring with  laughter at andy s novel contrivance for keeping oysters fresh  andy  was desired to take the  ancient and fish like smell  out of the room   amidst jeers and abuse  and  as he fumbled his way to the kitchen in  the dark  lamenting the hard fate of servants  who can never give  satisfaction  though they do everything they are bid  he went head over  heels down stairs  which event was reported to the whole house as soon  as it happened  by the enormous clatter of the broken dish  the oysters   and andy  as they all rolled one over the other to the bottom     o grady  having missed the cool supper he intended  and had longed for   was put into a rage by the disappointment  and as hunger with o grady  was only to be appeased by broiled bones  accordingly  against all the  endeavours of everybody  the bells rang violently through the house  and  the ogre like cry of  broiled bones   resounded high and low     the reader is sufficiently well acquainted with o grady by this time to  know  that of course  when once he had determined to have his broiled  bone  nothing on the face of the earth could prevent it but the want  of anything to broil  or the immediate want of his teeth  and as his  masticators were in order  and something in the house which could carry  mustard and pepper  the invalid primed and loaded himself with as much  combustible matter as exploded in a fever the next day     the supper party  however  in the hope of getting him to bed  separated  soon  and as scatterbrain and furlong were to start early in the morning  for dublin  the necessity of their retiring to rest was pleaded  the  honourable member had not been long in his room when he heard a tap at  his door  and his order to  come in  was followed by the appearance of  handy andy      i found somethin  on the road nigh the town to day  sir  and i thought  it might be yours  maybe   said andy  producing a small pocket book     the honourable member disavowed the ownership      well  there s something else i want to speak to your honour about       what is it  handy       i want your honour to see the account of the money your honour gave me  that i spint at the  shebeen   footnote  low publick house   upon the   lecthors that couldn t be accommodated at mrs  fay s       oh  never mind it  andy  if there s anything over  keep it yourself       thank your honour  but i must make the account all the same  if  you plaze  for i m going to father blake  to my duty   footnote   confession   soon  and i must have my conscience as clear as i can  and  i wouldn t like to be keeping money back       but if i give you the money  what matter       i d rather you d just look over this little bit of a count  if you  plaze   said andy  producing a dirty piece of paper  with some nearly  inscrutable hieroglyphics upon it  scatterbrain commenced an examination  of this literary phenomenon from sheer curiosity  asking andy at the  same time if  he  wrote it      yis  sir   said andy   but you see the man couldn t keep the count of  the piper s dhrink at all  it was so confusin   and so i was obliged to  pay

honour  it s not for that i showed you the  account       it s very like it  though   said scatterbrain  laughing   here  andy   here are a couple of pounds for you  take them  andy  take it and be  off  your bill is worth the money   and scatterbrain closed the door on  the great accountant     andy next went to furlong s room  to know if the pocket book belonged  to him  it did not  but furlong  though he disclaimed the ownership  had  that small curiosity which prompts little minds to pry into what does  not belong to them  and taking the pocket book into his hands  he opened  it  and fumbled over its leaves  in the doing of which a small piece of  folded paper fell from one of the pockets unnoticed by the impertinent  inquisitor or andy  to whom he returned the book when he had gratified  his senseless curiosity  andy withdrew  furlong retired to rest  and as  it was in the grey of an autumnal morning he dressed himself  the paper  still remained unobserved  so that the housemaid  on setting the room  to rights  found it  and fancying miss augusta was the proper person to  confide mr  furlong s stray papers to  she handed that young lady the  manuscript which bore the following copy of verses       i can ne er forget thee    i      it is the chime  the hour draws near      when you and i must sever     alas  it must be many a year       and it  may  be for ever     how long till we shall meet again       how short since first i met thee     how brief the bliss  how long the pain        for i can ne er forget thee     ii      you said my heart was cold and stern       you doubted love when strongest     in future days you ll live to learn      proud hearts can love the longest     oh  sometimes think  when press d to hear       when flippant tongues beset thee     that  all  must love thee  when thou rt near       but  one  will ne er forget thee     iii      the changeful sand doth only know      the shallow tide and latest     the rocks have mark d its highest flow       the deepest and the greatest     and deeper still the flood marks grow         so  since the hour i met thee     the more the tide of time doth flow       the less can i forget thee     when augusta saw the lines  she was charmed  she discovered her furlong  to be a poet  that the lines were his there was no doubt  they were   found in his room   and of course they  must  be his  just as partial  critics say certain irish airs must be english  because they are to be  found in queen elizabeth s music book     augusta was so charmed with the lines that she amused herself for a long  time in hiding them under the sofa cushion and making her pet dog find  and fetch them  her pleasure  however  was interrupted by her sister  charlotte remarking  when the lines were shown to her in triumph  that  the writing was not furlong s  but in a lady s hand     even as beer is suddenly soured by thunder  so the electric influence  of charlotte s words converted all augusta had been brewing to acidity   jealousy stung her like a wasp  and she boxed her dog s ears as he was  barking for another run with the verses      a  lady s  hand   said augusta  snatching the paper from her sister   i  declare if it ain t  the wretch  so he receives lines from ladies       i think i know the hand  too   said charlotte      you do   exclaimed augusta  with flashing eyes      yes  i m certain it is fanny dawson s writing       so it is   said augusta  looking at the paper as if her eyes could have  burnt it   to be sure  he was there before he came here       only for two days   said charlotte  trying to slake the flame she had  raised      but i ve heard that girl always makes conquests at first sight    returned augusta  half crying   and what do i see here  some words in  pencil      the words were so faint as to be scarcely perceptible  but augusta  deciphered them  they were written on the margin  beside a circumflex  which embraced the last four lines of the second verse  so that it stood  thus        sidenote  dearest  i will        oh  sometimes think  when press d to hear       when flippant tongues beset thee     that  all  must love thee when thou rt near       but  one  will ne er forget thee      will you  indeed   said augusta  crushing the paper in her hand  and  biting it   but i must not destroy it  i must keep it to prove his  treachery to his face   she threw herself on the sofa as she spoke  and  gave vent to an outpour of spiteful tears           chapter xxvii      how many chapters have been written about love verses  and how many  more might be written   might  would  could  should  or ought to be  written   i will venture to say   will  be written  i have a mind to  fulfil my own prophecy and write one myself  but no  my story must go  on  however  i  will  say  that it is quite curious in how many ways the  same little bit of paper may influence different people  the poem whose  literary merit may be small becomes precious when some valued hand has  transcribed the lines  and the verses whose measure and meaning viewed  in type might win favour and yield pleasure  shoot poison from their  very sweetness  when read in some particular hand and under particular  circumstances  it was so with the copy of verses augusta had just  read  they were fanny dawson s manuscript  that was certain  and found  in the room of augusta s lover  therefore augusta was wretched  but  these same lines had given exquisite pleasure to another person  who was  now nearly as miserable as augusta in having lost them  it is possible  the reader guesses that person to be edward o connor  for it was he who  had lost the pocket book in which those  to him  precious lines were  contained  and if the little case had held all the bank notes he ever  owned in his life  their loss would have been regarded less than that  bit of manuscript  which had often yielded  him  the most exquisite  pleasure  and was now inflicting on augusta the bitterest anguish  to  make this intelligible to the reader  it is necessary to explain under  what circumstances the lines were written  at one time  edward  doubting  the likelihood of making his way at home  was about to go to india and  push his fortunes there  and at that period  those lines  breathing of  farewell  implying the dread of rivals during absence  and imploring  remembrance of his eternal love  were written and given to fanny  and  she  with that delicacy of contrivance so peculiarly a woman s  hit upon  the expedient of copying his own verses and sending them to him in her  writing  as an indication that the spirit of the lines was her own     but edward saw that his father  who was advanced in years  looked upon a  separation from his son as an eternal one  and the thought gave so  much pain  that edward gave up the idea of expatriation  shortly after   however  the misunderstanding with major dawson took place  and fanny  and edward were as much severed as if dwelling in different zones  under  such circumstances  those lines were peculiarly precious  and many a  kiss had edward impressed upon them  though augusta thought them fitter  for the exercise of her teeth than her lips  in fact  edward did little  else than think of fanny  and it is possible his passion might have  degenerated into mere love sickness  and enfeebled him  had not  his desire of proving himself worthy of his mistress spurred him to  exertion  in the hope of future distinction  but still the tone of  tender lament pervaded all his poems  and the same pocket book whence  the verses which caused so much commotion fell contained the following  also  showing how entirely fanny possessed his heart and occupied his  thoughts       when the sun sinks to rest    i      when the sun sinks to rest     and the star of the west      sheds its soft silver light o er the sea     what sweet thoughts arise     as the dim twilight dies        for then i am thinking of thee     oh  then crowding fast    come the joys of the past       through the dimness of days long gone by     like the stars peeping out     through the darkness about     from the soft silent depth of the sky     ii      and thus  as the night    grows more lovely and bright      with the clust ring of planet and star     so this darkness of mine    wins a radiance divine      from the light that still lingers afar     then welcome the night     with its soft holy light       in its silence my heart is more free    the rude world to forget     where no pleasure i ve met      since the hour that i parted from thee     but we must leave love verses  and ask pardon for the few remarks which  the subject tempted  and pursue our story     the first prompting of augusta s anger  when she had recovered her burst  of passion  was to write   such a letter   to furlong  and she spent  half a day at the work  but she could not please herself  she tore  twenty at least  and determined  at last  not to write at all  but just  wait till he returned and overwhelm him with reproaches  but  though she  could not compose a letter  she composed herself by the endeavour  which  acted as a sort of safety valve to let off the superabundant steam   and it is wonderful how general is this result of sitting down to  write angry letters  people vent themselves of their spleen on the  uncomplaining paper  which silently receives words a listener would not   with a pen for our second  desperate satisfaction is obtained with only  an effusion of ink  and when once the pent up bitterness has oozed out  in all the blackness of that fluid  most appropriately made of the best  galls  the time so spent  and the  letting of words   if i may use the  phrase  has cooled our judgment and our passions together  and the  first letter is torn   t is  too  severe  we write a second  we blot and  interline till it is nearly illegible  we begin a third  till at last we  are tired out with our own angry feelings  and throw our scribbling by  with a  pshaw  what s the use of it   or   it s not worth my notice    or  still better  arrive at the conclusion  that we preserve our own  dignity best by writing without temper  though we may be called upon to  be severe     furlong at this time was on his road to dublin in happy unconsciousness  of augusta s rage against him  and planning what pretty little present  he should send her specially  for his head was naturally running on such  matters  as he had quantities of commissions to execute in the millinery  line for mrs  o grady  who thought it high time to be getting up  augusta s wedding dresses  and andy was to be despatched the following  day to dublin to take charge of a cargo of bandboxes back from that city  to neck or nothing hall  furlong had received a thousand charges from  the ladies   to be sure to lose no time  in doing his devoir in their  behalf  and he obeyed so strictly  and was so active in laying milliners  and mercers under contributions  that andy was enabled to start the day  after his arrival  sorely against andy s will  for he would gladly have  remained amidst the beauty and grandeur and wonders of dublin  which  struck him dumb for the day he was amongst them  but gave him food for  conversation for many a day after  furlong  after racking his invention  about the souvenir to his  dear gussy   at length fixed on a fan  as the  most suitable gift  for gussy had been quizzed at home about  blushing    and all that sort of thing  and the puerile perceptions of the  attache   saw something very smart in sending her wherewith  to hide her blushes    then the fan was the very pink of fans  it had quivers and arrows upon  it  and bunches of hearts looped up in azure festoons  and doves perched  upon them  though augusta s little sister  who was too young to know  what hearts and doves were  when she saw them for the first time  said  they were pretty little birds picking at apples  the fan was packed up  in a nice case  and then on scented note paper did the dear dandy  indite a bit of namby pamby badinage to his fair one  which he thought  excessively clever        dear ducky darling   you know how naughty they are in quizzing you  about a little something   i won t say what   you will guess  i dare  say  but i send you a little toy   i won t say what   on which  cupid might write this label after the doctor s fashion   to be used  occasionally  when the patient is much troubled with the symptoms       ever  ever  ever yours      p s  take care how you open it       j f      such was the note that handy andy was given  with particular injunctions  to deliver it the first thing on his arrival at the hall to miss  augusta  and to be sure to take most particular care of the little  case  all which andy faithfully promised to do  but andy s usual destiny  prevailed  and an unfortunate exchange of parcels quite upset all  furlong s sweet little plan of his pretty present and his ingenious  note  for as andy was just taking his departure  furlong said he might  as well leave something for him at reade s  the cutler  as he passed  through college green  and he handed him a case of razors which wanted  setting  which andy popped into his pocket  and as the fan case and that  of the razors were much of a size  and both folded up  andy left the  fan at the cutler s and took the case of razors by way of present  to augusta  fancy the rage of a young lady with a very fine pair of   moustachios  getting such a souvenir from her lover  with a note  too   every word of which applied to a beard and a razor  as patly as to a  blush and a fan  and this  too  when her jealousy was aroused and his  fidelity more than doubtful in her estimation     great was the row in neck or nothing hall  and when  after three days   furlong came down  the nature of his reception may be better imagined  than described  it was a difficult matter  through the storm which raged  around him  to explain all the circumstances satisfactorily  but  by  dint of hard work  the verses were at length disclaimed  the razors  disavowed  and andy at last sent for to  clear matters up      andy was a hopeful subject for such a purpose  and by his blundering  answers nearly set them all by the ears again  the upshot of the affair  was  that andy  used as he was to good scoldings  never had such a  torrent of abuse poured on him in his life  and the affair ended in  andy being dismissed from neck or nothing hall on the instant  so he  relinquished his greasy livery for his own rags again  and trudged  homewards to his mother s cabin      she ll be as mad as a hatter with me   said andy   bad luck to them for  razhirs  they cut me out o  my place  but i often heard cowld steel  is unlucky  and sure i know it now  oh  but i m always unfort nate in  having cruked messages  well  it can t be helped  and one good thing  at all events is  i ll have time enough now to go and spake to father  blake   and with this sorry piece of satisfaction poor andy contented  himself           chapter xxviii      the father blake  of whom andy spoke  was more familiarly known by the  name of father phil  by which title andy himself would have named  him  had he been telling how father phil cleared a fair  or equally   leathered  both the belligerent parties in a faction fight  or turned  out the contents  or malcontents  of a public house at an improper  hour  but when he spoke of his reverence respecting ghostly matters  the  importance of the subject begot higher consideration for the man  and  the familiar  father phil  was dropped for the more respectful title  of father blake  by either title  or in whatever capacity  the  worthy father had great influence over his parish  and there was a  free and easy way with him  even in doing the most solemn duties  which  agreed wonderfully with the devil may care spirit of paddy  stiff  and starched formality in any way is repugnant to the very nature of  irishmen  and i believe one of the surest ways of converting all ireland  from the romish faith would be found  if we could only manage to have  her mass celebrated with the dry coldness of the reformation  this may  seem ridiculous at first sight  and i grant it is a grotesque way of  viewing the subject  but yet there may be truth in it  and to consider  it for a moment seriously  look at the fact  that the north of ireland  is the stronghold of protestantism  and that the north is the  least   irish portion of the island  there is a strong admixture of scotch  there  and all who know the country will admit that there is nearly as  much difference between men from the north and south of ireland as from  different countries  the northerns retain much of the cold formality  and unbending hardness of the stranger settlers from whom they are  descended  while the southerns exhibit that warm hearted  lively  and  poetical temperament for which the country is celebrated  the prevailing  national characteristics of ireland are not to be found in the north   where protestantism flourishes  they are to be found in the south and  west  where it has never taken root  and though it has never seemed  to strike theologians  that in their very natures some people are more  adapted to receive one faith than another  yet i believe it to be true   and perhaps not quite unworthy of consideration  there are forms  it is  true  and many in the romish church  but they are not  cold  forms  but   attractive  rather  to a sensitive people  besides  i believe those  very forms  when observed the least formally  are the most influential  on the irish  and perhaps the splendours of a high mass in the gorgeous  temple of the holy city would appeal less to the affections of an irish  peasant than the service he witnesses in some half thatched ruin by a  lone hillside  familiarly hurried through by a priest who has sharpened  his appetite by a mountain ride of some fifteen miles  and is  saying mass  for the third time most likely  before breakfast  which  consummation of his morning s exercise he is anxious to arrive at     it was just in such a chapel  and under such circumstances  that father  blake was celebrating the mass at which andy was present  and after  which he hoped to obtain a word of advice from the worthy father   who was much more sought after on such occasions than his more sedate  superior who presided over the spiritual welfare of the parish  and  whose solemn celebration of the mass was by no means so agreeable as the  lighter service of father phil  the rev  dominick dowling was  austere and long winded   his  mass had an oppressive effect on his  congregation  and from the kneeling multitude might be seen eyes  fearfully looking up from under bent brows  and low breathings and  subdued groans often rose above the silence of his congregation  who  felt like sinners  and whose imaginations were filled with the thoughts  of heaven s anger  while the good humoured face of the light hearted  father phil produced a corresponding brightness on the looks of his  hearers  who turned up their whole faces in trustfulness to the mercy of  that heaven whose propitiatory offering their pastor was making for them  in cheerful tones  which associated well with thoughts of pardon and  salvation     father dominick poured forth his spiritual influence like a strong dark  stream that swept down the hearer  hopelessly struggling to keep his  head above the torrent  and dreading to be overwhelmed at the next  word  father phil s religion bubbled out like a mountain rill  bright   musical  and refreshing  father dominick s people had decidedly need of  cork jackets  father phil s might drink and be refreshed     but with all this intrinsic worth  he was  at the same time  a strange  man in exterior manners  for  with an abundance of real piety  he had  an abruptness of delivery and a strange way of mixing up an occasional  remark to his congregation in the midst of the celebration of the mass   which might well startle a stranger  but this very want of formality  made him beloved by the people  and they would do ten times as much for  father phil as for father dominick     on the sunday in question  when andy attended the chapel  father phil  intended delivering an address to his flock from the altar  urging them  to the necessity of bestirring themselves in the repairs of the chapel   which was in a very dilapidated condition  and at one end let in the  rain through its worn out thatch  a subscription was necessary  and  to raise this among a very impoverished people was no easy matter  the  weather happened to be unfavourable  which was most favourable to father  phil s purpose  for the rain dropped its arguments through the roof upon  the kneeling people below in the most convincing manner  and as they  endeavoured to get out of the wet  they pressed round the altar as  much as they could  for which they were reproved very smartly by  his reverence in the very midst of the mass  and these interruptions  occurred sometimes in the most serious places  producing a ludicrous  effect  of which the worthy father was quite unconscious in his great  anxiety to make the people repair the chapel     a big woman was elbowing her way towards the rails of the altar   and father phil  casting a sidelong glance at her  sent her to the  right about  while he interrupted his appeal to heaven to address her  thus     agnus dei   you d better jump over the rails of the althar  i  think  go along out o  that  there s plenty o  room in the chapel below  there      then he would turn to the altar  and proceed with the service  till  turning again to the congregation he perceived some fresh offender       orate  fratres    will you mind what i say to you and go along out of  that  there s room below there  thrue for you  mrs  finn  it s a shame  for him to be thramplin  on you  go along  darby casy  down there  and  kneel in the rain  it s a pity you haven t a dacent woman s cloak undher  you indeed    orate  fratres       then would the service proceed again  and while he prayed in silence at  the altar  the shuffling of feet edging out of the rain would disturb  him  and casting a backward glance  he would say       i hear you there  can t you be quiet and not be disturbin  the mass   you haythens      again he proceeded in silence  till the crying of a child interrupted  him  he looked round quickly      you d better kill the child  i think  thramplin  on him  lavery  go  out o  that  your conduct is scandalous   dominus vobiscum    again he  turned to pray  and after some time he made an interval in the service  to address his congregation on the subject of the repairs  and produced  a paper containing the names of subscribers to that pious work who had  already contributed  by way of example to those who had not      here it is   said father phil   here it is  and no denying it  down  in black and white  but if they who give are down in black  how much  blacker are those who have not given at all   but i hope they will  be ashamed of themselves when i howld up those to honour who have  contributed to the uphowlding of the house of god  and isn t it  ashamed o  yourselves you ought to be  to leave his house in such a  condition  and doesn t it rain a most every sunday  as if he wished to  remind you of your duty  aren t you wet to the skin a most every sunday   oh  god is good to you  to put you in mind of your duty  giving you such  bitther cowlds that you are coughing and sneezin  every sunday to that  degree that you can t hear the blessed mass for a comfort and a benefit  to you  and so you ll go on sneezin  until you put a good thatch on the  place  and prevent the appearance of the evidence from heaven against  you every sunday  which is condemning you before your faces  and behind  your backs too  for don t i see this minit a strame o  wather that might  turn a mill running down micky mackavoy s back  between the collar of  his coat and his shirt      here a laugh ensued at the expense of micky mackavoy  who certainly   was  under a very heavy drip from the imperfect roof      and is it laughing you are  you haythens   said father phil  reproving  the merriment which he himself had purposely created   that he  might reprove it    laughing is it you are  at your backslidings and  insensibility to the honour of god  laughing  because when you come here  to be  saved  you are  lost  intirely with the wet  and how  i ask you   are my words of comfort to enter your hearts  when the rain is pouring  down your backs at the same time  sure i have no chance of turning your  hearts while you are undher rain that might turn a mill  but once put a  good roof on the house  and i will inundate you with piety  maybe it s  father dominick you would like to have coming among you  who would grind  your hearts to powdher with his heavy words    here a low murmur of  dissent ran through the throng    ha  ha  so you wouldn t like it  i  see  very well  very well  take care then  for if i find you insensible  to my moderate reproofs  you hard hearted haythens  you malefacthors and  cruel persecuthors  that won t put your hands in your pockets  because  your mild and quiet poor fool of a pasthor has no tongue in his head   i  say your mild  quiet  poor fool of a pasthor  for i know my own faults   partly  god forgive me    and i can t spake to you as you deserve  you  hard living vagabones  that are as insensible to your duties as you are  to the weather  i wish it was sugar or salt you were made of  and then  the rain might melt you if i couldn t  but no  them naked rafthers grin  in your face to no purpose  you chate the house of god  but take care   maybe you won t chate the divil so aisy    here there was a sensation     ha  ha  that makes you open your ears  does it  more shame for you   you ought to despise that dirty enemy of man  and depend on something  betther  but i see i must call you to a sense of your situation with  the bottomless pit undher you  and no roof over you  oh dear  dear   dear   i m ashamed of you  troth  if i had time and sthraw enough  i d  rather thatch the place myself than lose my time talking to you  sure  the place is more like a stable than a chapel  oh  think of that   the  house of god to be like a stable   for though our redeemer  in his  humility  was born in a stable  that is no reason why you are to keep  his house always like one      and now i will read you the list of subscribers  and it will make you  ashamed when you hear the names of several good and worthy protestants  in the parish  and out of it  too  who have given more than the  catholics      he then proceeded to read the following list  which he interlarded  copiously with observations of his own  making  viva voce  marginal  notes as it were upon the subscribers  which were not unfrequently  answered by the persons so noticed  from the body of the chapel  and  laughter was often the consequence of these rejoinders  which father  phil never permitted to pass without a retort  nor must all this be  considered in the least irreverent  a certain period is allowed between  two particular portions of the mass  when the priest may address his  congregation on any public matter  an approaching pattern  or fair  or  the like  in which  exhortations to propriety of conduct  or warnings  against faction fights   c   are his themes  then they only listen in  reverence  but when a subscription for such an object as that already  mentioned is under discussion  the flock consider themselves entitled to   put in a word  in case of necessity     this preliminary hint is given to the reader  that he may better enter  into the spirit of father phil s    subscription list for the repairs and enlargement of  bally sloughgutphery chapel                             l  s  d     philip blake  p p     micky hicky                         he might as well have made ten

        l  s  d     dennis fannin                       very good  indeed  for a working                                       mason        jemmy riley                         not bad for a hedge carpenther         i gave you ten  plaze  your reverence   shouted jemmy   and by the same  token  you may remember it was on the nativity of the blessed vargin   sir  i gave you the second five shillin s       so you did  jemmy   cried father phil   i put a little cross before it   to remind me of it  but i was in a hurry to make a sick call when you  gave it to me  and forgot it after  and indeed myself doesn t know what  i did with that same five shillings      here a pallid woman  who was kneeling near the rails of the altar   uttered an impassioned blessing  and exclaimed   oh  that was the very  five shillings  i m sure  you gave to me that very day  to buy some  little comforts for my poor husband  who was dying in the fever    and  the poor woman burst into loud sobs as she spoke     a deep thrill of emotion ran through the flock as this accidental  proof of their poor pastor s beneficence burst upon them  and as an  affectionate murmur began to rise above the silence which that  emotion produced  the burly father philip blushed like a girl at this  publication of his charity  and even at the foot of that altar where he  stood  felt something like shame in being discovered in the commission  of that virtue so highly commended by the holy one to whose worship the  altar was raised  he uttered a hasty  whisht  whisht   and waved with  his outstretched hands his flock into silence     in an instant one of those sudden changes common to an irish assembly   and scarcely credible to a stranger  took place  the multitude was  hushed  the grotesque of the subscription list had passed away and was  forgotten  and that same man and that same multitude stood in altered  relations   they  were again a reverent flock  and  he  once more a  solemn pastor  the natural play of his nation s mirthful sarcasm  was absorbed in a moment in the sacredness of his office  and with a  solemnity befitting the highest occasion  he placed his hands together  before his breast  and raising his eyes to heaven he poured forth his  sweet voice  with a tone of the deepest devotion  in that reverential  call to prayer    orate    fratres       the sound of a multitude gently kneeling down followed  like the soft  breaking of a quiet sea on a sandy beach  and when father philip turned  to the altar to pray  his pent up feelings found vent in tears  and  while he prayed  he wept     i believe such scenes as this are not of unfrequent occurrence in  ireland  that country so long suffering  so much maligned  and so little  understood     suppose the foregoing scene to have been only described antecedent  to the woman in the outbreak of her gratitude revealing the priest s  charity  from which he recoiled   suppose the mirthfulness of the  incidents arising from reading the subscription list  a mirthfulness  bordering on the ludicrous  to have been recorded  and nothing more   a stranger would be inclined to believe  and pardonable in the belief   that the irish and their priesthood were rather prone to be irreverent   but observe  under this exterior  the deep sources of feeling that lie  hidden and wait but the wand of divination to be revealed  in a thousand  similar ways are the actions and the motives of the irish understood by  those who are careless of them  or worse  misrepresented by those whose  interest  and too often  business   it is to malign them     father phil could proceed no further with the reading of the  subscription list  but finished the office of the mass with unusual  solemnity  but if the incident just recorded abridged his address  and  the publication of donors  names by way of stimulus to the less active   it produced a great effect on those who had but smaller donations to  drop into the plate  and the grey headed collector  who could have  numbered the scanty coin before the bereaved widow had revealed the  pastor s charity  had to struggle his way afterwards through the eagerly  outstretched hands that showered their hard earned pence upon the plate   which was borne back to the altar heaped with contributions  heaped as  it had not been seen for many a day  the studied excitement of  their pride and their shame  and both are active agents in the irish  nature  was less successful than the accidental appeal to their  affections     oh  rulers of ireland  why have you not sooner learned to  lead  that  people by love  whom all your severity has been unable to  drive     footnote  when this passage was written ireland was disturbed  as she  has too often been  by special parliamentary provocation   the vexatious  vigilance of legislative lynxes  the peevishness of paltry persecutors      when the mass was over  andy waited at the door of the chapel to  catch  his riverence  coming out  and obtain his advice about what he  overheard from larry hogan  and father phil was accordingly accosted  by andy just as he was going to get into his saddle to ride over to  breakfast with one of the neighbouring farmers  who was holding the  priest s stirrup at the moment  the extreme urgency of andy s manner   as he pressed up to the pastor s side  made the latter pause and inquire  what he wanted   i want to get some advice from your riverence   said  andy       faith  then  the advice i give you is never to stop a hungry man  when he is going to refresh himself   said father phil  who had quite  recovered his usual cheerfulness  and threw his leg over his little grey  hack as he spoke   how could you be so unreasonable as to expect me to  stop here listening to your case  and giving you advice indeed  when  i have said three masses  footnote  the office of the mass must be  performed fasting   this morning  and rode three miles  how could you be  so unreasonable  i say       i ax your riverence s pardon   said andy   i wouldn t have taken the  liberty  only the thing is mighty particular intirely       well  i tell you again  never ask a hungry man advice  for he is likely  to cut his advice on the patthern of his stomach  and it s empty advice  you ll get  did you never hear that a  hungry stomach has no ears       the farmer who was to have the honour of the priest s company to  breakfast exhibited rather more impatience than the good humoured father  phil  and reproved andy for his conduct      but it s so particular   said andy      i wondher you would dar  to stop his riverence  and he black fastin    go  long wid you       come over to my house in the course of the week  and speak to me   said  father phil  riding away     andy still persevered  and taking advantage of the absence of the  farmer  who was mounting his own nag at the moment  said the matter of  which he wished to speak involved the interests of squire egan  or he  would not  make so bowld      this altered the matter  and father phil desired andy to follow him to  the farm house of john dwyer  where he would speak to him after he had  breakfasted           chapter xxix      john dwyer s house was a scene of activity that day  for not only was  the priest to breakfast there  always an affair of honour  but a grand  dinner was also preparing on a large scale  for a wedding feast was to  be held in the house  in honour of matty dwyer s nuptials  which were to  be celebrated that day with a neighbouring young farmer  rather well to  do in the world  the match had been on and off for some time  for john  dwyer was what is commonly called a  close fisted fellow   and his  would be son in law could not bring him to what he considered proper  terms  and though matty liked young casey  and he was fond of her  they  both agreed not to let old jack dwyer have the best of the bargain in  portioning off his daughter  who  having a spice of her father in her   was just as fond of  number one  as old jack himself  and here it is  worthy of remark  that  though the irish are so prone in general to  early and improvident marriages  no people are closer in their nuptial  barter  when they are in a condition to make marriage a profitable  contract  repeated meetings between the elders of families take place   and acute arguments ensue  properly to equalise the worldly goods to  be given on both sides  pots and pans are balanced against pails and  churns  cows against horses  a slip of bog against a gravel pit  or a  patch of meadow against a bit of a quarry  a little lime kiln sometimes  burns stronger than the flame of cupid  the doves of venus herself are  but crows in comparison with a good flock of geese  and a love sick  sigh less touching than the healthy grunt of a good pig  indeed  the  last named gentleman is a most useful agent in this traffic  for when  matters are nearly poised  the balance is often adjusted by a grunter  or two thrown into either scale  while matters are thus in a state of  debate  quarrels sometimes occur between the lovers the gentleman s  caution sometimes takes alarm  and more frequently the lady s pride  is aroused at the too obvious preference given to worldly gain over  heavenly beauty  cupid shies at mammon  and hymen is upset and left in  the mire     i remember hearing of an instance of this nature  when the lady gave her   ci devant  lover an ingenious reproof  after they had been separated  some time  when a marriage bargain was broken off  because the lover  could not obtain from the girl s father a certain brown filly as part of  her dowry  the damsel  after the lapse of some weeks  met her swain at a  neighbouring fair  and the flame of love still smouldering in his heart  was re illumined by the sight of his charmer  who  on the contrary   had become quite disgusted with  him  for his too obvious preference of  profit to true affection  he addressed her softly in a tent  and asked  her to dance  but was most astonished at her returning him a look of  vacant wonder  which tacitly implied    who are you    as plain as looks  could speak      arrah  mary   exclaimed the youth      sir      answered mary  with what heroines call  ineffable disdain       why one would think you didn t know me       if i ever had the honour of your acquaintance  sir   answered mary   i  forget you entirely       forget me  mary   arrah be aisy  is it forget the man that was courtin   and in love with you       you re under a mistake  young man   said mary  with a curl of her rosy  lip  which displayed the pearly teeth to whose beauty her woman s nature  rejoiced that the recreant lover was not yet insensible   you re under  a mistake  young man   and her heightened colour made her eye flash more  brightly as she spoke   you re quite under a mistake  no one was ever in  love with  me    and she laid signal emphasis on the word   there was  a dirty mane blackguard  indeed  once  in love with my father s brown  filly   but i forget him intirely      mary tossed her head proudly as she spoke  and her filly fancying  admirer  reeling under the reproof she inflicted  sneaked from the tent   while mary stood up and danced with a more open hearted lover  whose  earnest eye could see more charms in one lovely woman than all the  horses of arabia     but no such result as this was likely to take place in matty dwyer s  case  she and her lover agreed with one another on the settlement to  be made  and old jack was not to be allowed an inch over what was  considered an even bargain  at length all matters were agreed upon  the  wedding day fixed  and the guests invited  yet still both parties were  not satisfied  but young casey thought he should be put into absolute  possession of a certain little farm and cottage  and have the lease  looked over to see all was right  for jack dwyer was considered rather  slippery   while old jack thought it time enough to give him possession  and the lease and his daughter altogether     however  matters had gone so far that  as the reader has seen  the  wedding feast was prepared  the guests invited  and father phil on the  spot to help james and matty  in the facetious parlance of paddy  to   tie with their tongues what they could not undo with their teeth      when the priest had done breakfast  the arrival of andy was announced to  him  and andy was admitted to a private audience with father phil  the  particulars of which must not be disclosed  for in short  andy made a  regular confession before the father  and  we know  confessions must  be held sacred  but we may say that andy confided the whole post office  affair to the pastor  told him how larry hogan had contrived to worm  that affair out of him  and by his devilish artifice had  as andy  feared  contrived to implicate squire egan in the transaction  and   by threatening a disclosure  got the worthy squire into his villanous  power  andy  under the solemn queries of the priest  positively denied  having said one word to hogan to criminate the squire  and that hogan  could only infer the squire s guilt  upon which father phil  having  perfectly satisfied himself  told andy to make his mind easy  for that  he would secure the squire from any harm  and he moreover praised andy  for the fidelity he displayed to the interests of his old master  and  declared he was so pleased with him  that he would desire jack dwyer  to ask him to dinner   and that will be no blind nut  let me tell you    said father phil   a wedding dinner  you lucky dog   lashings  footnote   overflowing abundance  and plenty left after   and lavings   and no end  of dancing afther      andy was accordingly bidden to the bridal feast  to which the guests  began already to gather thick and fast  they strolled about the field  before the house  basked in groups in the sunshine  or lay in the shade  under the hedges  where hints of future marriages were given to many  a pretty girl  and to nudges and pinches were returned small screams  suggestive of additional assault  and inviting denials of  indeed  i won t   and that crowning provocative to riotous conduct   behave  yourself      in the meantime  the barn was laid out with long planks  supported on  barrels or big stones  which planks  when covered with clean cloths   made a goodly board  that soon began to be covered with ample wooden  dishes of corned beef  roasted geese  boiled chickens and bacon  and  intermediate stacks of cabbage and huge bowls of potatoes  all sending  up their wreaths of smoke to the rafters of the barn  soon to become  hotter from the crowd of guests  who  when the word was given  rushed to  the onslaught with right good will     the dinner was later than the hour named  and the delay arose from the  absence of one who  of all others  ought to have been present  namely   the bridegroom  but james casey was missing  and jack dwyer had  been closeted from time to time with several long headed greybeards   canvassing the occurrence  and wondering at the default on the  bridegroom s part  the person who might have been supposed to bear this  default the worst supported it better than any one  matty was all life  and spirits  and helped in making the feast ready  as if nothing wrong  had happened  and she backed father phil s argument to sit down to  dinner at once    that if james casey was not there  that was no reason  dinner should be spoiled  he d be there soon enough  besides  if he  didn t arrive in time  it was better he should have good meat cold  than  everybody have hot meat spoiled  the ducks would be done to cindhers   the beef boiled to rags  and the chickens be all in jommethry      so down they sat to dinner  its heat  its mirth  its clatter  and its  good cheer we will not attempt to describe  suffice it to say  the  viands were good  the guests hungry  and the drink unexceptionable  and  father phil  no bad judge of such matters  declared he never pronounced  grace over a better spread  but still  in the midst of the good cheer   neighbours  the women particularly  would suggest to each other the   wondher  where the bridegroom could be  and even within ear shot of the  bride elect  the low voiced whisper ran  of  where in the world is james  casey      still the bride kept up her smiles  and cheerfully returned the healths  that were drunk to her  but old jack was not unmoved  a cloud hung on  his brow  which grew darker and darker as the hour advanced  and the  bridegroom yet tarried  the board was cleared of the eatables  and the  copious jugs of punch going their round  but the usual toast of the  united healths of the happy pair could not be given  for one of them  was absent  father phil hardly knew what to do  for even his overflowing  cheerfulness began to forsake him  and a certain air of embarrassment  began to pervade the whole assembly  till jack dwyer could bear it no  longer  and  standing up  he thus addressed the company        friends and neighbours  you see the disgrace that s put on me and my  child      a murmur of  no  no   ran round the board      i say  yis       he ll come yet  sir   said a voice      no  he won t   said jack   i see he won t  i know he won t  he wanted  to have everything all his own way  and he thinks to disgrace me in  doing what he likes  but he shan t   and he struck the table fiercely as  he spoke  for jack  when once his blood was up  was a man of desperate  determination   he s a greedy chap  the same james casey  and he loves  his bargain betther than he loves you  matty  so don t look glum about  what i m saying  i say he s greedy  he s just the fellow that  if you  gave him the roof off your house  would ax you for the rails before your  door  and he goes back of his bargain now  bekase i would not let him  have it all his own way  and puts the disgrace on me  thinkin  i ll give  in to him  through that same  but i won t  and i tell you what it is   friends and neighbours  here s the lease of the three cornered field  below there   and he held up a parchment as he spoke   and a snug  cottage on it  and it s all ready for the girl to walk into with the man  that will have her  and if there s a man among you here that s willing   let him say the word now  and i ll give her to him      the girl could not resist an exclamation of surprise  which her father  hushed by a word and look so peremptory  that she saw remonstrance  was in vain  and a silence of some moments ensued  for it was rather  startling  this immediate offer of a girl who had been so strangely  slighted  and the men were not quite prepared to make advances  until  they knew something more of the why and wherefore of her sweetheart s  desertion      are yiz all dumb   exclaimed jack  in surprise   faix  it s not every  day a snug little field and cottage and a good looking girl falls in a  man s way  i say again  i ll give her and the lase to the man that will  say the word      still no one spoke  and andy began to think they were using jack dwyer  and his daughter very ill  but what business had  he  to think of  offering himself   a poor devil like him   but  the silence still  continuing  andy took heart of grace  and as the profit and pleasure of  a snug match and a handsome wife flushed upon him  he got up and said    would i do  sir      every one was taken by surprise  even old jack himself  and matty could  not suppress a faint exclamation  which every one but andy understood to  mean  she didn t like it at all   but which andy interpreted quite the  other way  and he grinned his loutish admiration of matty  who turned  away her head from him in sheer distaste  which action andy took for  mere coyness     jack was in a dilemma  for andy was just the last man he would have  chosen as a husband for his daughter  but what could he do  he was  taken at his word  and even at the worst he was determined that some one  should marry the girl out of hand  and show casey the  disgrace should  not be put on him   but  anxious to have another chance  he stammered  something about the fairness of  letting the girl choose   and that   some one else might wish to spake   but the end of all was  that no one  rose to rival andy  and father phil bore witness to the satisfaction he  had that day in finding so much uprightness and fidelity in  the boy    that he had raised his character much in his estimation by his conduct  that day  and if he was a little giddy betimes  there was nothing like  a wife to steady him  and if he was rather poor  sure jack dwyer could  mend that      then come up here   says jack  and andy left his place at the very end  of the board and marched up to the head  amidst clapping of hands and  thumping of the table  and laughing and shouting      silence   cried father phil   this is no laughing matther  but a  serious engagement  and  john dwyer  i tell you  and you andy rooney   that girl must not be married against her own free will  but if she has  no objection  well and good       my will is her pleasure  i know   said jack  resolutely     to the surprise of every one  matty said   oh  i ll take the boy with  all my heart      handy andy threw his arms round her neck and gave her a most vigorous  salute which came smacking off  and thereupon arose a hilarious shout  which made the old rafters of the barn ring again      there s the lase for you   said jack  handing the parchment to andy   who was now installed in the place of honour beside the bride elect at  the head of the table  and the punch circulated rapidly in filling to  the double toast of health  happiness  and prosperity to the  happy  pair   and after some few more circuits of the enlivening liquor had  been performed  the women retired to the dwelling house  whose sanded  parlour was put in immediate readiness for the celebration of the  nuptial knot between matty and the adventurous andy     in half an hour the ceremony was performed  and the rites and blessings  of the church dispensed between two people  who  an hour before  had  never looked on each other with thoughts of matrimony     under such circumstances it was wonderful with what lightness of  spirit matty went through the honours consequent on a peasant bridal in  ireland  these  it is needless to detail  our limits would not permit   but suffice it to say  that a rattling country dance was led off by andy  and matty in the barn  intermediate jigs were indulged in by the  picked  dancers  of the parish  while the country dancers were resting and  making love  if making love can be called rest  in the corners  and that  the pipers and punch makers had quite enough to do until the night was  far spent  and it was considered time for the bride and bridegroom to be  escorted by a chosen party of friends to the little cottage which was to  be their future home  the pipers stood at the threshold of jack dwyer   and his daughter departed from under the  roof tree  to the tune of  joy  be with you   and then the lilters  heading the body guard of the bride   plied drone and chanter right merrily until she had entered her new  home  thanked her old friends  who did all the established civilities   and cracked all the usual jokes attendant on the occasion   and andy  bolted the door of the snug cottage of which he had so suddenly become  master  and placed a seat for the bride beside the fire  requesting    miss dwyer   to sit down  for andy could not bring himself to call her   matty  yet  and found himself in an awkward position in being  lord  and master  of a girl he considered so far above him a few hours before   matty sat quiet  and looked at the fire      it s very quare  isn t it   says andy with a grin  looking at her  tenderly  and twiddling his thumbs      what s quare   inquired matty  very drily      the estate   responded andy      what estate   asked matty      your estate and my estate   said andy      sure you don t call the three cornered field my father gave us an  estate  you fool   answered matty      oh no   said andy   i mane the blessed and holy estate of matrimony the  priest put us in possession of   and andy drew a stool near the heiress   on the strength of the hit he thought he had made      sit at the other side of the fire   said matty  very coldly      yes  miss   responded andy  very respectfully  and in shoving his seat  backwards the legs of the stool caught in the earthen floor  and andy  tumbled heels over head     matty laughed while andy was picking himself up with increased  confusion at this mishap  for even amidst rustics there is nothing more  humiliating than a lover placing himself in a ridiculous position at the  moment he is doing his best to make himself agreeable      it is well your coat s not new   said matty  with a contemptuous look  at handy s weather beaten vestment      i hope i ll soon have a betther   said andy  a little piqued  with all  his reverence for the heiress  at this allusion to his poverty   but  sure it wasn t the coat you married  but the man that s in it  and sure  i ll take off my clothes as soon as you please  matty  my dear  miss  dwyer  i mane  i beg your pardon       you had better wait till you get better   answered matty  very drily    you know the old saying   don t throw out your dirty wather until you  get in fresh        ah  darlin   don t be cruel to me   said andy  in a supplicating tone    i know i m not desarvin  of you  but sure i did not make so bowld as to  make up to you until i seen that nobody else would have you       nobody else have me   exclaimed matty  as her eyes flashed with anger      i beg your pardon  miss   said poor andy  who in the extremity of his  own humility had committed such an offence against matty s pride   i  only meant that        say no more about it   said matty  who recovered her equanimity    didn t my father give you the lase of the field and house       yis  miss       you had better let me keep it then   twill be safer with me than you       sartainly   said andy  who drew the lease from his pocket and handed it  to her  and  as he was near to her  he attempted a little familiarity   which matty repelled very unequivocally      arrah  is it jokes you are crackin    said andy  with a grin  advancing  to renew his fondling      i tell you what it is   said matty  jumping up   i ll crack your head  if you don t behave yourself   and she seized the stool on which she had  been sitting  and brandished it in a very amazonian fashion      oh  wirra  wirra   said andy  in amaze   aren t you my wife        your  wife   retorted matty  with a very devil in her eye    your   wife  indeed  you great  omadhaun   why  then  had you the brass to  think i d put up with  you        arrah  then  why did you marry me   said andy  in a pitiful  argumentative whine      why did i marry you   retorted matty   didn t i know betther than  refuse you  when my father said the word  when the divil was busy  with him   why did i marry you   it s a pity i didn t refuse  and be  murthered that night  maybe  as soon as the people s backs was turned   oh  it s little you know of owld jack dwyer  or you wouldn t ask me  that  but  though i m afraid of him  i m not afraid of you  so stand off  i tell you       oh  blessed virgin   cried andy   and what will be the end of it      there was a tapping at the door as he spoke      you ll soon see what will be the end of it   said matty  as she walked  across the cabin and opened to the knock     james casey entered and clasped matty in his arms  and half a dozen  athletic fellows and one old and debauched looking man followed  and the  door was immediately closed after their entry     andy stood in amazement while casey and matty caressed each other  and  the old man said in a voice tremulous with intoxication   a very pretty  filly  by jingo       i lost no time the minute i got your message  matty   said casey   and  here s the father ready to join us       ay  ay   cackled the old reprobate   hammer and tongs   strike while  the iron s hot   i m the boy for a short job   and he pulled a greasy  book from his pocket as he spoke     this was a degraded clergyman  known in ireland under the title of   couple beggar   who is ready to perform irregular marriages on such  urgent occasions as the present  and matty had contrived to inform james  casey of the desperate turn affairs had taken at home  and recommended  him to adopt the present plan  and so defeat the violent measure of her  father by one still more so     a scene of uproar now ensued  for andy did not take matters quietly  but  made a pretty considerable row  which was speedily quelled  however  by  casey s bodyguard  who tied andy neck and heels  and in that  helpless state he witnessed the marriage ceremony performed by the   couple beggar   between casey and the girl he had looked upon as his  own five minutes before     in vain did he raise his voice against the proceeding  the   couple beggar  smothered his objections in ribald jests      you can t take her from me  i tell you   cried andy      no  but we can take you from her   said the  couple beggar   and  at  the words  casey s friends dragged andy from the cottage  bidding a  rollicking adieu to their triumphant companion  who bolted the door  after them and became possessor of the wife and property poor andy  thought he had secured     to guard against an immediate alarm being given  andy was warned on pain  of death to be silent as his captors bore him along  and he took them  to be too much men of their word to doubt they would keep their promise   they bore him through a lonely by lane for some time  and on arriving at  the stump of an old tree  bound him securely to it  and left him to pass  his wedding night in the tight embraces of hemp           chapter xxx      the news of andy s wedding  so strange in itself  and being celebrated  before so many  spread over the country like wildfire  and made the talk  of half the barony for the next day  and the question    arrah  did  you hear of the wondherful wedding    was asked in high road and  by road   and scarcely a  boreen  whose hedges had not borne witness  to this startling matrimonial intelligence  the story  like all other  stories  of course got twisted into various strange shapes  and  fanciful exaggerations became grafted on the original stem  sufficiently  grotesque in itself  and one of the versions set forth how old jack  dwyer  the more to vex casey  had given his daughter the greatest  fortune that ever had been heard of in the country     now one of the open eared people who had caught hold of the story by  this end happened to meet andy s mother  and  with a congratulatory  grin  began with  the top o  the mornin  to you  mrs  rooney  and sure i  wish you joy       och hone  and for why  dear   answered mrs  rooney   sure  it s nothin   but trouble and care i have  poor and in want  like

mother  in amazement   andy  indeed   out o  place   and without a bawbee to bless himself with   stayin  out all night  the  blackguard       by this and that  i don t think you know a word about it   cried the  friend  whose turn it was for wonder now      don t i  indeed   said mrs  rooney  huffed at having her word doubted   as she thought   i tell you he never  was  at home last night  and  maybe it s yourself was helping him  micky lavery  to keep his bad  coorses  the slingein  dirty blackguard that he is      micky lavery set up a shout of laughter  which increased the ire of mrs   rooney  who would have passed on in dignified silence but that micky  held her fast  and when he recovered breath enough to speak  he  proceeded to tell her about andy s marriage  but in such a disjointed  way  that it was some time before mrs  rooney could comprehend him  for  his interjectional laughter at the capital joke it was  that she should  be the last to know it  and that he should have the luck to tell  it  sometimes broke the thread of his story  and then his collateral  observations so disfigured the tale  that its incomprehensibility became  very much increased  until at last mrs  rooney was driven to push him by  direct questions      for the tendher mercy  micky lavery  make me sinsible  and don t  disthract me  is the boy married       yis  i tell you       to jack dwyer s daughter       yis       and gev him a fort n        gev him half his property  i tell you  and he ll have all when the owld  man s dead       oh  more power to you  andy   cried his mother in delight   it s you  that  is  the boy  and the best child that ever was  half his property   you tell me   misther  lavery   added she  getting distant and polite  the moment she found herself mother to a rich man  and curtailing her  familiarity with a poor one like lavery      yes   ma am    said lavery  touching his hat   and the whole of it when  the owld man dies       then indeed i wish him a happy relase    footnote  a  happy release   is the irish phrase for departing this life  said mrs  rooney   piously   not that i owe the man any spite  but sure he d be no  loss  and it s a good wish to any one  sure  to wish them in heaven   good mornin   misther lavery   said mrs  rooney  with a patronising  smile  and  going the road with a dignified air      mick lavery looked after her with mingled wonder and indignation   bad  luck to you  you owld sthrap   he muttered between his teeth   how  consaited you are  all of a sudden  by jakers  i m sorry i  towld you  cock you up  indeed  put a beggar on horseback to be  sure  humph   the devil cut the tongue out o  me if ever i give any one  good news again  i ve a mind to turn back and tell tim dooling his horse  is in the pound      mrs  rooney continued her dignified pace as long as she was in sight  of lavery  but the moment an angle of the road screened her from his  observation  off she set  running as hard as she could  to embrace her  darling andy  and realise with her own eyes and ears all the good news  she had heard  she puffed out by the way many set phrases about the  goodness of providence  and arranged at the same time sundry fine  speeches to make to the bride  so that the old lady s piety and flattery  ran a strange couple together along with herself  while mixed up with  her prayers and her blarney  were certain speculations about jack  dwyer  as to how long he could  live   and how much he might  leave      it was in this frame of mind she reached the hill which commanded a view  of the three cornered field and the snug cottage  and down she rushed to  embrace her darling andy and his gentle bride  puffing and blowing like  a porpoise  bang she went into the cottage  and matty being the first  person she met  she flung herself upon her  and covered her with  embraces and blessings     matty  being taken by surprise  was some time before she could shake off  the old beldame s hateful caresses  but at last getting free and tucking  up her hair  which her imaginary mother in law had clawed about her  ears  she exclaimed in no very gentle tones       arrah  good woman  who axed for  your  company  who are you at all       your mother in law  jewel   cried the widow rooney  making another  open armed rush at her beloved daughter in law  but matty received the  widow s protruding mouth on her clenched fist instead of her lips  and  the old woman s nose coming in for a share of matty s knuckles  a ruby  stream spurted forth  while all the colours of the rainbow danced before  mrs  rooney s eyes as she reeled backward on the floor      take that  you owld faggot   cried matty  as she shook mrs  rooney s  tributary claret from the knuckles which had so scientifically tapped  it  and wiped her hand in her apron     the old woman roared  millia  murthur  on the floor  and snuffled out a  deprecatory question  if that was the proper way to be received in her  son s house        your  son s house  indeed   cried matty   get out o  the place  you  stack o  rags       oh  andy  andy   cried the mother  gathering herself up      oh  that s it  is it   cried matty   so it s andy you want       to be sure  why wouldn t i want him  you hussy  my boy  my darlin   my  beauty       well  go look for him   cried matty  giving her a shove towards the  door   well  now  do you think i ll be turned out of my son s house  so quietly as that  you unnatural baggage   cried mrs  rooney  facing  round  fiercely  upon which a bitter altercation ensued between the  women  in the course of which the widow soon learnt that andy was not  the possessor of matty s charms  whereupon the old woman  no longer  having the fear of damaging her daughter in law s beauty before her  eyes  tackled to for a fight in right earnest  in the course of which  some reprisals were made by the widow in revenge for her broken nose   but matty s youth and activity  joined to her amazonian spirit  turned  the tide in her favour  though  had not the old lady been blown by her  long run  the victory would not have been so easy  for she was a tough  customer  and  left  matty certain marks of her favour that did not  rub out in a hurry  while she took  away   as a keepsake  a handful of  matty s hair  by which she had long held on till a successful kick from  the gentle bride finally ejected mrs  rooney from the house     off she reeled  bleeding and roaring  and while on her approach she  had been blessing heaven and inventing sweet speeches for matty  on her  retreat she was cursing fate and heaping all sorts of hard names on the  amazon she came to flatter  alas  for the brevity of human exultation     how fared it in the meantime with andy  he  poor devil  had passed a  cold night  tied up to the old tree  and as the morning dawned  every  object appeared to him through the dim light in a distorted form  the  gaping hollow of the old trunk to which he was bound seemed like a huge  mouth  opening to swallow him  while the old knots looked like eyes   and the gnarled branches like claws  staring at and ready to tear him in  pieces     a raven  perched above him on a lonely branch  croaked dismally  till  andy fancied he could hear words of reproach in the sounds  while a  little tomtit chattered and twittered on a neighbouring bough  as if  he enjoyed and approved of all the severe things the raven uttered  the  little tomtit was the worst of the two  just as the solemn reproof  of the wise can be better borne than the impertinent remark of some  chattering fool  to these imaginary evils was added the reality of some  enormous water rats that issued from an adjacent pool and began to eat  andy s hat and shoes  which had fallen off in his struggle with his  captors  and all andy s warning ejaculations could not make the vermin  abstain from his shoes and his hat  which  to judge from their eager  eating  could not stay their stomachs long  so that andy  as he looked  on at the rapid demolition  began to dread that they might transfer  their favours from his attire to himself  until the tramp of approaching  horses relieved his anxiety  and in a few minutes two horsemen stood  before him  they were father phil and squire egan     great was the surprise of the father to see the fellow he had married  the night before  and whom he supposed to be in the enjoyment of his  honeymoon  tied up to a tree and looking more dead than alive  and his  indignation knew no bounds when he heard that a  couple beggar  had  dared to celebrate the marriage ceremony  which fact came out in the  course of the explanation andy made of the desperate misadventure which  had befallen him  but all other grievances gave way in the eyes of  father phil to the  couple beggar       a  couple beggar    the audacious vagabones   he cried  while he and  the squire were engaged in loosing andy s bonds   a  couple beggar   in my parish  how fast they have tied him up  squire   he added  as he  endeavoured to undo a knot   a  couple beggar   indeed  i ll undo the  marriage   have you a knife about you  squire   the blessed and holy tie  of matrimony   it s a black knot  bad luck to it  and must be cut  take  your leg out o  that now  and wait till i lay my hands on them  a   couple beggar  indeed       a desperate outrage this whole affair has been   said the squire      but a  couple beggar   squire       his house broken into        but a  couple beggar         his wife taken from him        but a  couple beggar         the laws violated        but  my dues   squire  think o  that   what would become o   them   if   couple beggars  is allowed to show their audacious faces in the parish   oh  wait till next sunday  that s all  i ll have them up before the  althar  and i ll make them beg god s pardon  and my pardon  and the  congregation s pardon  the audacious pair    footnote  a man and woman  who had been united by a  couple beggar  were called up one sunday by  the priest in the face of the congregation  and summoned  as father phil  threatens above  to beg god s pardon  and the priest s pardon  and the  congregation s pardon  but the woman stoutly refused the last condition    i ll beg god s pardon and your reverence s pardon   she said   but i  won t beg the congregation s pardon    you won t   says the priest    i won t   says she   oh you conthrairy baggage   cried his reverence    take her home out o  that   said he to her husband who had humbled  himself   take her home  and leather her well  for she wants it  and if  you don t leather her  you ll be sorry  for if you don t make her afraid  of you  she ll master you  too  take her home and leather her    fact       it s an assault on andy   said the squire      it s a robbery on me   said father phil      could you identify the men   said the squire      do you know the  couple beggar    said the priest      did james casey lay his hands on you   said the squire   for he s a  good man to have a warrant against       oh  squire  squire   ejaculated father phil   talking of laying hands  on  him  is it you are   didn t that blackguard  couple beggar  lay  his dirty hands on a woman that my bran new benediction was upon  sure   they d do anything after that   by this time andy was free  and having  received the squire s directions to follow him to merryvale  father  phil and the worthy squire were once more in their saddles and proceeded  quietly to the same place  the squire silently considering the audacity  of the  coup de main  which robbed andy of his wife  and his reverence  puffing out his rosy cheeks and muttering sundry angry sentences  the  only intelligible words of which were  couple beggar            chapter xxxi      doubtless the reader has anticipated that the presence of father phil in  the company of the squire at this immediate time was on account of the  communication made by andy about the post office affair  father phil had  determined to give the squire freedom from the strategetic coil in which  larry hogan had ensnared him  and lost no time in setting about it  and  it was on his intended visit to merryvale that he met its hospitable  owner  and telling him there was a matter of some private importance he  wished to communicate  suggested a quiet ride together  and this it  was which led to their traversing the lonely little lane where they  discovered andy  whose name was so principal in the revelations of that  day     to the squire those revelations were of the dearest importance  for they  relieved his mind from a weight which had been oppressing it for some  time  and set his heart at rest  egan  it must be remarked  was an odd  mixture of courage and cowardice  undaunted by personal danger  but  strangely timorous where moral courage was required  a remarkable  shyness  too  made him hesitate constantly in the utterance of a word  which might explain away any difficulty in which he chanced to find  himself  and this helped to keep his tongue tied in the matter where  larry hogan had continued to make himself a bugbear  he had a horror   too  of being thought capable of doing a dishonourable thing  and the  shame he felt at having peeped into a letter was so stinging  that the  idea of asking any one s advice in the dilemma in which he was placed  made him recoil from the thought of such aid  now  father phil had  relieved him from the difficulties his own weakness imposed  the subject  had been forced upon him  and once forced to speak he made a full  acknowledgment of all that had taken place  and when he found andy had  not borne witness against him  and that larry hogan only  inferred  his  participation in the transaction  he saw on father phil s showing that  he was not really in larry hogan s power  for though he admitted he had  given larry a trifle of money from time to time when larry asked for it   under the influence of certain innuendoes  yet that was no proof against  him  and father phil s advice was to get andy out of the way as soon as  possible  and then to set larry quietly at defiance  that is to say  in  father phil s own words   to keep never minding him      now andy not being encumbered with a wife  as fate had so ordained it   made the matter easier  and the squire and the father  as they rode  towards merryvale together to dinner  agreed to pack off andy without  delay  and thus place him beyond hogan s power  and as dick dawson was  going to london with murphy  to push the petition against scatterbrain s  return  it was looked upon as a lucky chance  and andy was at once named  to bear them company      but you must not let hogan know that andy is sent away under your  patronage  squire   said the father   for that would be presumptive  evidence you had an interest in his absence  and hogan is the very  blackguard would see it fast enough  for he is a knowing rascal       he s the deepest scoundrel i ever met   said the squire      as knowing as a jailer   said father phil   a jailer  did i say  by  dad  he bates any jailer i ever heard of  for that fellow is so  cute   he  could keep newgate with a book and eye        by the bye  there s one thing i forgot to tell you  respecting those  letters i threw into the fire  for remember  father  i only peeped into   one  and destroyed the others  but one of the letters  i must tell you   was directed to yourself        faith  then  i forgive you that  squire   said father phil   for i  hate letters  but if you have any scruple of conscience on the subject   write me one yourself  and that will do as well      the squire could not help thinking the father s mode of settling the  difficulty worthy of handy andy himself  but he did not tell the father  so     they had now reached merryvale  where the good humoured priest was  heartily welcomed  and where doctor growling  dick dawson  and murphy  were also guests at dinner  great was the delight of the party at the  history they heard  when the cloth was drawn  of andy s wedding  so  much in keeping with his former life and adventures  and father phil had  another opportunity of venting his rage against the  couple beggar       that was but a slip knot you tied  father   said the doctor      aye  aye  joke away  doctor       do you think  father phil   said murphy   that  that  marriage was made  in heaven  where we are told marriages  are  made       i don t suppose it was  mr  murphy  for if it had it would have held  upon earth       very well answered  father   said the squire      i don t know what other people think about matches being made in  heaven   said growling   but i have my suspicions they are sometimes  made in another place       oh  fie  doctor   said mrs  egan      the doctor  ma am  is an old bachelor   said father phil   or he  wouldn t say so       thank you  father phil  for so polite a speech      the doctor took his pencil from his pocket and began to write on a small  bit of paper  which the priest observing  asked him what he was about    or is it writing a prescription you are   said he   for compounding  better marriages than i can       something very naughty  i dare say  the doctor is doing   said fanny  dawson      judge for yourself  lady fair   said the doctor  handing fanny the slip  of paper     fanny looked at it for a moment and smiled  but declared it was very  wicked indeed      then read it for the company  and condemn me out of your own pretty  mouth  miss dawson   said the doctor      it is too wicked       if it is ever so wicked   said father phil   the wickedness will be  neutralised by being read by an angel       well done  st  omer s   cried murphy      really  father   said fanny  blushing   you are desperately gallant  to day  and just to shame you  and show how little of an angel i am  i   will  read the doctor s epigram          though matches are all made in heaven  they say       yet hymen  who mischief oft hatches     sometimes deals with the house  t other side of the way        and  there  they make  lucifer  matches        oh  doctor  i m afraid you are a woman hater   said mrs  egan   come  away  fanny  i am sure they want to get rid of us       yes   said fanny  rising and joining her sister  who was leaving the  room   and now  after abusing poor hymen  gentlemen  we leave you to  your favourite worship of bacchus      the departure of the ladies changed the conversation  and after the  gentlemen had resumed their seats  the doctor asked dick dawson how soon  he intended going to london      i start immediately   said dick   don t forget to give me that letter  of introduction to your friend in dublin  whom i long to know       who is he   asked the squire      one tom loftus  or  as his friends call him   piping tom   from his  vocal powers  or  as some nickname him    organ  loftus   from his  imitation of that instrument  which is an excessively comical piece of  caricature       oh  i know him well   said father phil      how did you manage to become acquainted with him   inquired the doctor    for i did not think he lay much in your way       it was  he  became acquainted with me   said father phil   and this  was the way of it  he was down on a visit betimes in the parish i was in  before this  and his behaviour was so wild that i was obliged to make  an allusion in the chapel to his indiscretions  and threaten to make  his conduct a subject of severe public censure if he did not mind his  manners a little better  well  my dear  who should call on me on  the monday morning after but misther tom  all smiles and graces  and  protesting he was sorry he fell under my displeasure  and hoping i would  never have cause to find fault with him again  sure  i thought he was  repenting of his misdeeds  and i said i was glad to hear such good  words from him   a  then  father   says he   i hear you have got a great  curiosity from dublin  a shower bath  i hear   so i said i had  and  indeed  to be candid  i was as proud as a peacock of the same bath   which tickled my fancy when i was once in town  and so i bought it    would you show it to me   says he   to be sure   says i  and off i  went  like a fool  and put the wather on the top  and showed him how   when a string was pulled  down it came  and he pretended not clearly  to understand the thing  and at last he said   sure it s not into that  sentry box you get   says he   oh yes   said i  getting into it quite  innocent  when  my dear  he slaps the door and fastens it on me  and  pulls the string and souses me with the water  and i with my best suit  of black on me  i roared and shouted inside while misther tom loftus was  screechin  laughing outside  and dancing round the room with delight  at  last  when he could speak  he said   now  father  we re even   says he    for the abuse you gave me yesterday   and off he ran       that s just like him   said old growling  chuckling   he s a queer  devil  i remember on one occasion a poor dandy puppy  who was in the  same office with him  for tom is in the ordnance department  you must  know  this puppy  sir  wanted to go to the ashbourne races and cut a  figure in the eyes of a rich grocer s daughter he was sweet upon       being sweet upon a grocer s daughter   said murphy   is like bringing  coals to newcastle        faith  it was coals to newcastle with a vengeance  in the present  case  for the girl would have nothing to say to him  and tom had great  delight whenever he could annoy this poor fool in his love making plots   so  when he came to tom to ask for the loan of his horse  tom said he  should have him  if he could make the smallest use of him    but i don t  think you can   said tom   leave that to me   said the youth   i don t  think you could make him go   said tom   i ll buy a new pair of spurs    said the puppy   let them be handsome ones   said tom   i was looking at  a very handsome pair at lamprey s  yesterday   said the young gentleman    then you can buy them on your way to my stables   said tom  and sure  enough  sir  the youth laid out his money on a very costly pair of  persuaders  and then proceeded homewards with tom   now  with all your  spurs   said tom   i don t think you ll be able to make him go    is he  so very vicious  then   inquired the youth  who began to think of his  neck   on the contrary   said tom   he s perfectly quiet  but won t go  for  you   i ll bet a pound    done   said the youth   well  try him    said tom  as he threw open the stable door   he s lazy  i see   said the  youth   for he s lying down    faith  he is   said tom   and hasn t got  up these two days    get up  you brute   said the innocent youth  giving  a smart cut of his whip on the horse s flank  but the horse did not  budge    why  he s dead    says he   yes   says tom   since monday last   so i don t think you can make him go  and you ve lost your bet        that was hardly a fair joke   said the squire      tom never stops to think of that   returned the doctor   he s the  oddest fellow i ever knew  the last time i was in dublin  i called on  tom and found him one bitter cold and stormy morning standing at an open  window  nearly quite undressed  on asking him what he was about  he  said he was  getting up a bass voice   that mrs  somebody  who gave good  dinners and bad concerts  was disappointed of her bass singer   and i  think   said tom   i ll be hoarse enough in the evening to take double  b flat  systems are the fashion now   said he   there is the logierian  system and other systems  and mine is the cold air ian system  and the  best in the world for getting up a bass voice        that was very original certainly   said the squire      but did you ever hear of his adventure with the duke of wellington    said the doctor      the duke   they all exclaimed      yes  that is  when he was only sir arthur wellesley  well  i ll tell  you       stop   said the squire   a fresh story requires a fresh bottle  let me  ring for some claret            chapter xxxii      the servant who brought in the claret announced at the same time the  arrival of a fresh guest in the person of  captain moriarty   who  was welcomed by most of the party by the name of randal  the squire  regretted he was too late for dinner  inquiring at the same time if  he would like to have something to eat at the side table  but randal  declined the offer  assuring the squire he had got some refreshment  during the day while he had been out shooting  but as the sport led  him  near merryvale  and  he had a great thirst upon him   he did not know a  better house in the country wherein to have  that same  satisfied      then you re just in time for some cool claret   said the squire   so  sit down beside the doctor  for he must have the first glass and broach  the bottle  before he broaches the story he s going to tell us  that s  only fair      the doctor filled his glass  and tasted   what a nice   chateau     margaux   must be   said he  as he laid down his glass   i should like  to be a tenant at will there  at a small rent       and no taxes   said dick      except my duty to the claret   replied the doctor        my favourite chateau     is that of margaux       by the bye  talking of  chateau   there s the big brewer over at the  town  who is anxious to affect gentility  and he heard some one use the  word  chapeau   and having found out it was the french for  hat   he  determined to show off on the earliest possible occasion  and selected  a public meeting of some sort to display his accomplishment  taking  some cause of objection to the proceedings  as an excuse for leaving the  meeting  he said   gentlemen  the fact is i can t agree with you  so i  may as well take my  chateau  under my arm at once  and walk        illustration  tom organ loftus and the duke      is not that an invention of your own  doctor   said the squire      i heard it for fact   said growling      and  t is true   added murphy   for i was present when he said it  and  at an earlier part of the proceedings he suggested that the parish clerk  should read the resolutions  because he had a good   laudable  voice        a parish clerk ought to have   said the doctor   eh  father  phil     laudamus         leave your latin   said dick   and tell us that story you promised  about the duke and tom loftus       right  misther dick   said father phil      the story  doctor   said the squire      oh  don t make such bones about it   said growling    tis but a trifle  after all  only it shows you what a queer and reckless rascal tom is  i  told you he was called   organ   loftus by his friends  in consequence  of the imitation he makes of that instrument  and it certainly is worth  hearing and seeing  for your eyes have as much to do with the affair  as your ears  tom plants himself on a high office stool  before one of  those lofty desks with long rows of drawers down each side and a  hole between to put your legs under  well  sir  tom pulls out the  top drawers  like the stops of an organ  and the lower ones by way of  pedals  and then he begins thrashing the desk like the finger board of  an organ with his hands  while his feet kick away at the lower drawers  as if he were the greatest pedal performer out of germany  and he  emits a rapid succession of grunts and squeaks  producing a ludicrous  reminiscence of the instrument  which i defy any one to hear without  laughing  several sows and an indefinite number of sucking pigs could  not make a greater noise  and tom himself declares he studied the  instrument in a pigsty  which he maintains gave the first notion of  an organ  well  sir  the youths in the office assist in  doing the  service   as they call it  that is  making an imitation of the chanting  and so forth in st  patrick s cathedral       oh  the haythens   said father phil      one does spray  and another weyman  and another sir john stevenson  and  so on  and they go on responsing and singing  amen  till the ordnance  office rings again       have they nothing better to do   asked the squire      very little but reading the papers   said the doctor      well  tom  you must know  sir  was transferred some time ago  by the  interest of many influential friends  to the london department  and the  fame of his musical powers had gone before him from some of the english  clerks in ireland who had been advanced to the higher posts in dublin   and kept up correspondence with their old friends in london  and it was  not long until tom was requested to go through an anthem on the great  office desk  tom was only too glad to be asked  and he kept the  whole office in a roar for an hour with all the varieties of the  instrument  from the diapason to the flute stop  and the devil a more  business was done in the office  that  day  and tom before long made the  sober english fellows as great idlers as the chaps in dublin  well  it  was not long until a sudden flush of business came upon the department   in consequence of the urgent preparations making for supplies to spain   at the time the duke was going there to take the command of the army   and organ playing was set aside for some days  but the fellows  after  a week s abstinence  began to yearn for it and tom was requested to  do  the service   tom  nothing loath  threw aside his official papers  set  up a big ledger before him  and commenced his legerdemain  as he called  it  pulled out his stops  and began to work away like a weaver  while  every now and then he swore at the bellows blower for not giving him  wind enough  whereupon the choristers would kick the bellows blower to  accelerate his flatulency  well  sir  they were in the middle of the  service  and all the blackguards making the responses in due season   when  just as tom was quivering under a portentous grunt  which might  have shamed the principal diapason of harlaem  and the subs were  drawing out a resplendent  a a a men   the door opened  and in walked a  smart looking gentleman  with rather a large nose and quick eye  which  latter glanced round the office  where a sudden endeavour was made by  everybody to get back to his place  the smart gentleman seemed rather  surprised to see a little fat man blowing at a desk instead of the  fire  and long tom kicking  grunting  and squealing like mad  the  bellows blower was so taken by surprise he couldn t stir  and tom   having his back to them  did not see what had taken place  and went on  as if nothing had happened  till the smart gentleman went up to him  and  tapping on tom s desk with a little riding whip  he said   i m sorry to  disturb you  sir  but i wish to know what you re about    we re doing  the service  sir   said tom  no ways abashed at the sight of the  stranger  for he did not know it was sir arthur wellesley was talking to  him   not the  public  service  sir   said sir arthur   yes  sir   said  tom   the service as by law established in the second year of the reign  of king edward the sixth   and he favoured the future hero of waterloo  with a touch of the organ   who is the head of this office   inquired  sir arthur  tom  with a very gracious bow  replied   i am principal  organist  sir  and allow me to introduce you to the principal  bellows blower   and he pointed to the poor little man who let the  bellows fall from his hand as sir arthur fixed his eyes on him  tom did  not perceive till now that all the clerks were taken with a sudden fit  of industry  and were writing away for the bare life  and he cast a  look of surprise round the office while sir arthur was looking at the  bellows blower  one of the clerks made a wry face at tom  which showed  him all was not right   is this the way his majesty s service generally  goes on here   said sir arthur  sharply  no one answered  but tom saw   by the long faces of the clerks and the short question of the visitor   that he was  somebody        some transports are waiting for ordnance stores  and i am referred  to this office   said sir arthur   can any one give me a satisfactory  answer       the senior clerk present  for the head of the office was absent  came  forward and said   i believe  sir           you  believe   but you don t  know    said sir arthur   so i must wait  for stores while you are playing tomfoolery here  i ll report this    then producing a little tablet and a pencil  he turned to tom and said    favour me with your name  sir        i give you my honour  sir   said tom       i d rather you d give me the stores  sir   i ll trouble you for your  name        upon my honour  sir   said tom  again       you seem to have a great deal of that article on your hands  sir    said sir arthur   you re an irishman  i suppose        yes  sir   said tom       i thought so  your name        loftus  sir        ely family        no  sir        glad of it       he put up his tablet after writing the name       may i beg the favour to know  sir   said tom   to whom i have the  honour of addressing myself     sir arthur wellesley  sir        oh  j   s   cried tom   i m done       sir arthur could not help laughing at the extraordinary change in tom s  countenance  and tom  taking advantage of this relaxation in his iron  manner  said in a most penitent tone   oh  sir arthur wellesley  only  forgive me this time  and  pon my  sowl  says he  with the richest  brogue   i ll play a  te deum  for the first licking you give the  french   sir arthur smiled and left the office       did he report as he threatened   asked the squire       faith  he did       and tom   inquired dick      was sent back to ireland  sir       that was hard  after the duke smiled at him   said murphy      well  he did not let him suffer in pocket  he was transferred at as a  good a salary to a less important department  but you know the duke has  been celebrated all his life for never overlooking a breach of duty       and who can blame him   said moriarty      one great advantage of the practice has been   said the squire   that  no man has been better served  i remember hearing a striking instance of  what  perhaps  might be called severe justice  which he exercised on a  young and distinguished officer of artillery in spain  and though one  cannot help pitying the case of the gallant young fellow who was the  sacrifice  yet the question of strict duty   to the very word   was  set at rest for ever under the duke s command  and it saved much   after  trouble by making every officer satisfied  however fiery his  courage or tender his sense of being suspected of the white feather   that implicit obedience was the course he  must  pursue  the case  was this   the army was going into action       what action was it    inquired father phil  with that remarkable alacrity which men of peace  evince in hearing the fullest particulars about war  perhaps because  it is forbidden to their cloth  one of the many instances of things  acquiring a fictitious value by being interdicted  just as father phil  himself might have been a protestant only for the penal laws      i don t know what action it was   said the squire   nor the officer s  name  for i don t set up for a military chronicler  but it was  as  i have been telling you  going into action that the duke posted an  officer  with his six guns  at a certain point  telling him to remain  there until he had orders from  him   away went the rest of the army   and the officer was left doing nothing at all  which he didn t like   for he was one of those high blooded gentlemen who are never so happy as  when they are making other people miserable  and he was longing for the  head of a french column to be hammering away at  in half an hour or  so he heard the distant sound of action  and it approached nearer and  nearer  until he heard it close behind him  and he wondered rather that  he was not invited to take a share in it  when  pat to his thought  up  came an  aide de camp  at full speed  telling him that general somebody  ordered him to bring up his guns  the officer asked did not the order  come from lord wellington  the  aide de camp  said no  but from the  general  whoever he was  the officer explained that he was placed there  by lord wellington  under command not to move  unless by  an order from  himself   the  aide de camp  stated that the general s entire brigade  was being driven in and must be annihilated without the aid of the guns   and asked   would he let a whole brigade be slaughtered   in a tone  which wounded the young soldier s pride  savouring  as he thought it  did  of an imputation on his courage  he immediately ordered his guns  to move and joined battle with the general  but while he was away  an   aide de camp  from lord wellington rode up to where the guns  had been  posted   and  of course  no gun was to be had for the service which lord  wellington required  well  the french were repulsed  as it happened  but  the want of those six guns seriously marred a preconcerted movement of  the duke s  and the officer in command of them was immediately brought  to a court martial  and would have lost his commission but for the  universal interest made in his favour by the general officers in  consideration of his former meritorious conduct and distinguished  gallantry  and under the peculiar circumstances of the case  they did  not break him  but he was suspended  and lord wellington sent him home  to england  almost every general officer in the army endeavoured to get  his sentence revoked  lamenting the fate of a gallant fellow being sent  away for a slight error in judgment while the army was in hot action but  lord wellington was inexorable saying he must make an example to secure  himself in the perfect obedience of officers to their orders  and it had  the effect       well  that s what i call hard   said dick      my dear dick   said the squire   war is altogether a hard thing  and a  man has no business to be a general who isn t as hard as his own round  shot       and what became of the  dear  young man   said father phil  who seemed  much touched by the readiness with which the  dear  young man set off to  mow down the french      i can tell you   said moriarty   for i served with him afterwards  in the peninsula  he was let back after a year or so  and became so  thorough a disciplinarian  that he swore  when once he was at his post   they might kill  his father  before his face and he wouldn t budge  until he had orders        a most christian resolution   said the doctor      well  i can tell you   said moriarty   of a frenchman  who made a  greater breach of discipline  and it was treated more leniently  i heard  the story from the man s own lips  and if i could only give you his  voice and gesture and manner it would amuse you  what fellows those  frenchmen are  to be sure  for telling a story  they make a shrug or  a wink have twenty different meanings  and their claws are most  eloquent  one might say they talk on their fingers  and their broken  english  i think  helps them       then give the story  randal  in his manner   said dick   i have heard  you imitate a frenchman capitally       well  here goes   said moriarty  but let me wet my whistle with a  glass of claret before i begin  a french story should have french wine    randal tossed off one glass  and filled a second by way of reserve  and  then began the french officer s story      you see  sare  it vos ven in  espagne  de bivouac vos vairy ard indeet   pon

 young man  remember   said he  i will never forget his vorts   young  man   vine is goot  slip is goot  goat is goot  but honners is  betters         a capital story  randal   cried dick   but how much of it did you  invent        pon my life  it is as near the original as possible       besides  that is not a fair way of using a story   said the doctor    you should take a story as you get it  and not play the dissector upon  it  mangling its poor body to discover the bit of embellishment  and as  long as a  raconteur  maintains  vraisemblance   i contend you are bound  to receive the whole as true       a most author like creed  doctor   said dick   you are a story teller  yourself  and enter upon the defence of your craft with great spirit       and justice  too   said the squire   the doctor is quite right       don t suppose i can t see the little touches of the artist   said the  doctor   but so long as they are in keeping with the picture  i  enjoy them  for instance  my friend randal s touch of the englishman    fissling got safe de king   is very happy  quite in character       well  good or bad  the story in substance is true   said randal   and  puts the englishman in a fine point of view  a generous fellow  sharing  his supper with his enemy whose sword may be through his body in the  next morning s  affair        but the frenchman was generous to him first   remarked the squire      certainly  i admit it   said randal   in short  they were both fine  fellows       oh  sir   said father phil   the french are not deficient in a  chivalrous spirit  i heard once a very pretty little bit of anecdote  about the way they behaved to one of our regiments on a retreat in  spain        your  regiments   said moriarty  who was rather fond of hitting hard  at a priest when he could   a regiment of friars is it       no  captain  but of soldiers  and it s going through a river they  were  and the french  taking advantage of their helpless condition  were  peppering away at them hard and fast       very generous indeed   said moriarty  laughing      let me finish my story  captain  before you quiz it  i say they were  peppering them sorely while they were crossing the river  until some  women  the followers of the camp  ran down  poor creatures  to the  shore  and the stream was so deep in the middle they could scarcely ford  it  so some dragoons who were galloping as hard as they could out of  the fire pulled up on seeing the condition of the women kind  and each  horseman took up a woman behind him  though it diminished his own power  of speeding from the danger  the moment the french saw this act of manly  courtesy  they ceased firing  gave the dragoons a cheer  and as long as  the women were within gunshot  not a trigger was pulled in the french  line  but volleys of cheers instead of ball cartridge was sent after the  brigade till all the women were over  now wasn t that generous        t was a handsome thing   was the universal remark      and  faith i can tell you  captain moriarty  the army took advantage of  it  for there was a great struggle to have the pleasure of the ladies   company over the river       i dare say  father phil   said the squire  laughing      throth  squire   said the  padre    fond of the girls as the soldiers  have the reputation of being  they never liked them better than that  same day       yes  yes   said moriarty  a little piqued  for he rather affected the   dare devil       i see you mean to insinuate that we soldiers fear fire       i did not say  fear   captain  but they d like to get out of it  for  all that  and small blame to them  aren t they flesh and blood like  ourselves       not a bit like you   said moriarty   you sleek and smooth gentlemen who  live in luxurious peace know little of a soldier s danger or feelings       captain  we all have our dangers to go through  and may be a priest has  as many as a soldier  and we only show a difference of taste  after all   in the selection       well  father blake  all i know is  that a true soldier fears nothing    said moriarty with energy      maybe so   answered father phil  quietly   it is quite clear  however    said murphy   that war  with all its horrors  can call out occasionally  the finer feelings of our natures  but it is only such redeeming traits  as those we have heard which can reconcile us to it  i remember having  heard an incident of war  myself  which affected me much   said murphy   who caught the infection of military anecdote which circled the table   and indeed there is no more catching theme can be started among men  for  it may be remarked that whenever it is broached it flows on until it is  rather more than time to go to the ladies      it was in the earlier portion of the memorable day of waterloo   said  murphy   that a young officer of the guards received a wound which  brought him to the ground  his companions rushed on to seize some point  which their desperate valour was called on to carry  and he was left   utterly unable to rise  for the wound was in his foot  he lay for some  hours with the thunder of that terrible day ringing around him  and many  a rush of horse and foot had passed close beside him  towards the close  of the day he saw one of the black brunswick dragoons approaching   who drew rein as his eye caught the young guardsman  pale and almost  fainting  on the ground  he alighted  and finding he was not mortally  wounded  assisted him to rise  lifted him into his saddle  and helped  to support him there while he walked beside him to the english rear  the  brunswicker was an old man  his brow and moustache were grey  despair  was in his sunken eye  and from time to time he looked up with an  expression of the deepest yearning into the face of the young soldier   who saw big tears rolling down the veteran s cheek while he gazed upon  him   you seem in bitter sorrow  my kind friend   said the stripling    no wonder   answered the old man  with a hollow groan   i and my three  boys were in the same regiment  they were alive the morning of ligny  i  am childless to day  but i have revenged them   he said fiercely  and  as he spoke he held out his sword  which was literally red with blood    but  oh  that will not bring me back my boys   he exclaimed  relapsing  into his sorrow   my three gallant boys    and again he wept bitterly   till clearing his eyes from the tears  and looking up in the young  soldier s handsome face  he said tenderly   you are like my youngest  one  and i could not let you lie on the field       even the rollicking murphy s eyes were moist as he recited this  anecdote  and as for father phil  he was quite melted  ejaculating in an  under tone   oh  my poor fellow  my poor fellow       so there   said murphy   is an example of a man  with revenge in his  heart  and his right arm tired with slaughter  suddenly melted into  gentleness by a resemblance to his child        t is very touching  but very sad   said the squire      my dear sir   said the doctor  with his peculiar dryness   sadness is  the principal fruit which warfare must ever produce  you may talk of  glory as long as you like  but you cannot have your laurel without your  cypress  and though you may select certain bits of sentiment out of a  mass of horrors  if you allow me  i will give you one little story which  shan t keep you long  and will serve as a commentary upon war and glory  in general      at the peace of       i happened to be travelling through a town in  france where a certain count i knew resided  i waited upon him  and he  received me most cordially  and invited me to dinner  i made the excuse  that i was only  en route   and supplied with but traveling costume  and  therefore not fit to present myself amongst the guests of such a house  as his  he assured me i should only meet his own family  and pledged  himself for madame la comtesse being willing to waive the ceremony of a   grande toilette   i went to the house at the appointed hour  and as  i passed through the hall i cast a glance at the dining room and saw  a very long table laid  on arriving at the reception room  i taxed the  count with having broken faith with me  and was about making my excuses  to the countess when she assured me the count had dealt honestly by me   for that i was the only guest to join the family party  well  we  sat down to dinner  three and twenty persons  myself  the count and  countess  and their  twenty children   and a more lovely family i never  saw  he a man in the vigour of life  she a still attractive woman  and  these their offspring lining the table  where the happy eyes of father  and mother glanced with pride and affection from one side to the other  on these future staffs of their old age  well  the peace of amiens  was of short duration  and i saw no more of the count till napoleon s  abdication  then i visited france again  and saw my old friend  but it  was a sad sight  sir  in that same house  where  little more than ten  years before  i had seen the bloom and beauty of twenty children  to  sit down with  three   all he had left him  his sons had fallen in  battle  his daughters had died widowed  leaving but orphans  and thus it  was all over france  while the public voice shouted  glory   wailing was  in her homes  her temple of victory was filled with trophies  but her  hearths were made desolate       still  sir  a true soldier fears nothing   repeated moriarty       baithershin    said father phil    faith i have been in places of  danger you d be glad to get out of  i can tell you  as bould as you are   captain       you ll pardon me for doubting you  father blake   said moriarty  rather  huffed       faith then you wouldn t like to be where i was before i came here   that is  in a mud cabin  where i was giving the last rites to six people  dying in the typhus fever       typhus   exclaimed moriarty  growing pale  and instinctively  withdrawing his chair as far as he could from the  padre  beside whom he  sat      ay  typhus  sir  most inveterate typhus       gracious heaven   said moriarty  rising   how can you do such a  dreadful thing as run the risk of bearing infection into society       i thought soldiers were not afraid of anything   said father phil   laughing at him  and the rest of the party joined in the merriment      fairly hit  moriarty   said dick      nonsense   said moriarty   when i spoke of danger  i meant such  open danger as  in short  not such insidious lurking abomination as  infection  for i contend that        say no more  randal   said growling   you re done   father phil has  floored you       i deny it   said moriarty  warmly  but the more he denied it  the more  every one laughed at him      you re more frightened than hurt  moriarty   said the squire   for the  best of the joke is  father phil wasn t in contact with typhus at all   but was riding with me  and  tis but a joke      here they all roared at moriarty  who was excessively angry  but felt  himself in such a ridiculous position that he could not quarrel with  anybody      pardon me  my dear captain   said the father   i only wanted to show  you that a poor priest has to run the risk of his life just as much as  the boldest soldier of them all  but don t you think  squire   t is time  to join the ladies  i m sure the tay will be tired waiting for us            chapter xxxiii      mrs  egan was engaged in some needlework  and fanny turning over the  leaves of a music book  and occasionally humming some bars of her  favourite songs  as the gentlemen came into the drawing room  fanny rose  from the pianoforte as they entered      oh  miss dawson   exclaimed moriarty   why tantalise us so much as  to let us see you seated in that place where you can render so much  delight  only to leave it as we enter      fanny turned off the captain s flourishing speech with a few lively  words and a smile  and took her seat at the tea table to do the honours    the captain   said father phil to the doctor   is equally great in love  or war       and knows about as little of one as the other   said the doctor   his  attacks are too open       and therefore easily foiled   said father phil   how that pretty  creature  with the turn of a word and a curl of her lip  upset him that  time  oh  what a powerful thing a woman s smile is  doctor  i often  congratulate myself that my calling puts all such mundane follies and  attractions out of my way  when i see and know what fools wise men are  sometimes made by silly girls  oh  it is fearful  doctor  though  of  course  part of the mysterious dispensation of an all wise providence       that fools should have the mastery  is it   inquired the doctor  drily   with a mischievous query in his eye as well   tut  tut  tut  doctor    replied father phil  impatiently   you know well enough what i mean   and i won t allow you to engage me in one of your ingenious battles of  words  i speak of that wonderful influence of the weaker sex over  the stronger  and how the word of a rosy lip outweighs sometimes the  resolves of a furrowed brow  and how the  pooh  pooh  i m making a fool  of myself talking to you  but to make a long story short  i would rather   wrastle  out a logical dispute any day  or a tough argument of one of  the fathers  than refute some absurdity which fell from a pretty mouth  with a smile on it       oh  i quite agree with you   said the doctor  grinning   that the  fathers are not half such dangerous customers as the daughters       ah  go along with you  doctor   said father phil  with a good humoured  laugh   i see you are in one of your mischievous moods  and so i ll have  nothing more to say to you      the father turned away to join the squire  while the doctor took a seat  near fanny dawson and enjoyed a quiet little bit of conversation with  her  while moriarty was turning over the leaves of her album  but the  brow of the captain  who affected a taste in poetry  became knit  and  his lip assumed a contemptuous curl  as he perused some lines  and asked  fanny whose was the composition      i forget   was fanny s answer      i don t wonder   said moriarty   the author is not worth remembering   for they are very rough      fanny did not seem pleased with the criticism  and said that  when sung  to the measure of the air written down on the opposite page  they were  very flowing      but the principal phrase  the   refrain   i may say  is so vulgar    added moriarty  returning to the charge   the gentleman says   what  would you do   and the lady answers   that s what i d do   do you call  that poetry       i don t call  that  poetry   said fanny  with some emphasis on the  word   but if you connect those two phrases with what is intermediately  written  and read all in the spirit of the entire of the verses  i think  there is poetry in them  but if not poetry  certainly feeling       can you tolerate   that s what i d do     the pert answer of a  housemaid       a phrase in itself homely   answered fanny   may become elevated by the  use to which it is applied       quite true  miss dawson   said the doctor  joining in the discussion    but what are these lines which excite randal s ire       here they are   said moriarty   i will read them  if you allow me  and  then judge between miss dawson and me        what will you do  love  when i am going                        with white sail flowing                                 the seas beyond      what will you do  love  when         stop thief   stop thief   cried the doctor   why  you are robbing  the poet of his reputation as fast as you can  you don t attend to the  rhythm of those lines  you don t give the ringing of the verse       that s just what i have said in other words   said fanny   when sung to  the melody  they are smooth       but a good reader  miss dawson   said the doctor   will read verse with  the proper accent  just as a musician would divide it into bars  but my  friend randal there  although he can tell a good story and hit off prose  very well  has no more notion of rhythm or poetry than new beer has of a  holiday       and why  pray  has not new beer a notion of a holiday       because  sir  it works of a sunday       your  beer  may be new  doctor  but your  joke  is not  i have seen it  before in some old form       well  sir  if i found it in its old form  like a hare  and started it  fresh  it may do for folks to run after as well as anything else  but  you shan t escape your misdemeanour in mauling those verses as you have  done  by finding fault with my joke  redevivus   you read those lines   sir  like a bellman  without any attention to metre       to be sure   said father phil  who had been listening for some time    they have a ring in them        like a pig s nose   said the doctor      ah  be aisy   said father phil   i say they have a ring in them like an  owld latin canticle         what  will  you  do   love  when i am  go  ing                        with white sail  flow  ing                                 the says be yond       that s it       to be sure   said the doctor   i vote for the father s reading them out  on the spot       pray  do  mister blake   said fanny      ah  miss dawson  what have i to do with reading love verses       take the book  sir   said growling   and show me you have some faith in  your own sayings  by obeying a lady directly       pooh  pooh   said the priest      you  won t  refuse me   said fanny  in a coaxing tone      my dear miss dawson   said the  padre        father phil    said fanny  with one of her rosy smiles      oh  wow  wow  wow   ejaculated the priest  in an amusing embarrassment    i see you will make me do whatever you like   so father phil gave the  rare example of a man acting up to his own theory  and could not resist  the demand that came from a pretty mouth  he took the book and read the  lines with much feeling  but  with an observance of rhythm so grotesque   that it must be given in his own manner     what will you do  love     i       what  will  you  do   love  when i am  go  ing       with white sail  flow  ing         the seas be  yond      what  will  you  do   love  when waves di  vide  us       and friends may chide us         for being  fond          though waves di  vide  us  and friends be  chi  ding       in faith a  bi  ding         i ll still be true     and i ll pray for  thee  on the stormy  o  cean       in deep de  vo  tion           that s  what  i ll do      ii       what  would  you  do   love  if distant  ti  dings      thy fond con  fi  dings        should under  mine     and i a  bi  ding  neath sultry  skies        should think other  eyes         were as bright as  thine          oh  name it  not   though guilt and  shame       were on thy  name          i d still be  true      but that heart of  thine   should another  share  it       i could not  bear it            what  would  i do      iii       what  would  you do  when  home re  turn  ing       with hopes high  burn  ing         with wealth for  you        if my  bark   that  bound  ed o er foreign  foam        should be lost near  home            ah  what  would  you do         so them wert  spar  d  i d bless the  mor  row         in want and  sor  row           that left me  you      and i d welcome  thee  from the wasting  bil  low         my heart thy  pil  low             that s  what  i d do       footnote  note to the third edition   the foregoing dialogue and  moriarty s captious remarks were meant  when  they appeared in the first  edition  as a hit at a certain small critic  a would be song writer  who  does ill natured articles for the reviews  and expressed himself very  contemptuously of my songs because of their simplicity  or  as he was  pleased to phrase it   i had a knack of putting common things together    the song was written to illustrate my belief that the most common place  expression   appropriately applied   may successfully serve the purposes  of the lyric  and here experience has proved me right  for this  very song of  what will you do    containing within it the other  common place   that s what i d do   has been received with special  favour by the public  whose long continued goodwill towards my  compositions generally i gratefully acknowledge       well done   padre    said the doctor   with good emphasis and  discretion       and now  my dear miss dawson   said father phil   since i ve read  the lines at your high bidding  will you sing them for me at my humble  asking       very antithetically put  indeed   said fanny   but you must excuse me       you said there was a tune to it       yes  but i promised captain moriarty to sing him  this    said fanny   going over to the pianoforte  and laying her hand on an open music book      thanks  miss dawson   said moriarty  following fast     now  it was not that fanny dawson liked the captain that she was going  to sing the song  but she thought he had been rather   mobbed   by the  doctor and the  padre  about the reading of the verses  and it was her  good breeding which made her pay this little attention to the worsted  party  she poured forth her sweet voice in a simple melody to the  following words       say not my heart is cold    i       say not my heart is cold       because of a silent tongue     the lute of faultless mould      in silence oft hath hung     the fountain soonest spent      doth babble down the steep     but the stream that  ever  went      is silent  strong  and deep     ii       the charm of a secret life      is given to choicest things       of flowers  the fragrance rife      is wafted on viewless wings     we see not the charmed air      bearing some witching sound     and ocean deep is where      the pearl of price is found     iii       where are the stars by day       they burn  though all unseen     and love of purest ray      is like the stars  i ween     unmark d is the gentle light      when the sunshine of joy appears     but ever  in sorrow s night        t will glitter upon thy tears       well  randal  does that poem satisfy your critical taste   of the  singing there can be but one opinion       yes  i think it pretty   said moriarty   but there is one word in the  last verse i object to       which is that   inquired growling       ween   said the other    the stars  i ween   i object to       don t you see the meaning of that   inquired the doctor   i think it is  a very happy allusion       i don t see any allusion whatever   said the critic      don t you see the poet alluded to the stars in the  milky  way  and  says  therefore   the stars i  wean         bah  bah  doctor   exclaimed the critical captain   you are in one  of your quizzing moods to night  and it is in vain to expect a serious  answer from you   he turned on his heel as he spoke  and went away      moriarty  you know  miss dawson  is a man who affects a horror of  puns  and therefore i always punish him with as many as i can   said the  doctor  who was left by moriarty s sudden pique to the enjoyment of a  pleasant chat with fanny  and he was sorry when the hour arrived which  disturbed it by the breaking up of the party and the departure of the  guests           chapter xxxiv      when the widow rooney was forcibly ejected from the house of mrs  james  casey  and found that andy was not the possessor of that lady s charms   she posted off to neck or nothing hall  to hear the full and true  account of the transaction from andy himself  on arriving at the old  iron gate  and pulling the loud bell  she was spoken to through the  bars by the savage old janitor and told to  go out o  that   mrs  rooney  thought fate was using her hard in decreeing she was to receive denial  at every door  and endeavoured to obtain a parley with the gate keeper   to which he seemed no way inclined      my name s rooney  sir       there s plenty bad o  the name   was the civil rejoinder      and my son s in squire o grady s sarvice  sir       oh  you re the mother of the beauty we call handy  eh       yis  sir       well  he left the sarvice yistherday       is it lost the place       yis       oh dear  ah  sir  let me up to the house and spake to his honour  and  maybe he ll take back the boy       he doesn t want any more servants at all  for he s dead       is it squire o grady dead       aye  did you never hear of a dead squire before       what did he die of  sir       find out   said the sulky brute  walking back into his den     it was true  the renowned o grady was no more  the fever which had set  in from his  broiled bones   which he  would  have in spite of anybody   was found difficult of abatement  and the impossibility of keeping  him quiet  and his fits of passion  and consequent fresh supplies of   broiled bones   rendered the malady unmanageable  and the very  day after andy had left the house the fever took a bad turn  and in  four and twenty hours the stormy o grady was at peace     what a sudden change fell upon the house  all the wedding paraphernalia  which had been brought down lay neglected in the rooms where it had  been the object of the preceding day s admiration  the deep  absorbing   silent grief of the wife   the more audible sorrow of the girls   the  subdued wildness of the reckless boys  as they trod silently past the  chamber where they no longer might dread reproof for their noise   all  this was less touching than the effect the event had upon the old  dowager mother  while the senses of others were stunned by the blow   hers became awakened by the shock  all her absurd aberration passed  away  and she sat in intellectual self possession by the side of her  son s death bed  which she never left until he was laid in his  coffin  he was the first and last of her sons  she had now none but  grandchildren to look upon  the intermediate generation had passed away   and the gap yawned fearfully before her  it restored her  for the time   perfectly to her senses  and she gave the necessary directions on the  melancholy occasion  and superintended all the sad ceremonials befitting  the time  with a calm and dignified resignation which impressed all  around her with wonder and respect     superadded to the dismay which the death of the head of a family  produces was the terrible fear which existed that o grady s body would  be seized for debt  a barbarous practice  which  shame to say  is still  permitted  this fear made great precaution necessary to prevent persons  approaching the house  and accounts for the extra gruffness of the gate  porter  the wild body guard of the wild chief was on doubly active duty   and after four and twenty hours had passed over the reckless boys  the  interest they took in sharing and directing this watch and ward seemed  to outweigh all sorrowful consideration for the death of their  father  as for gustavus  the consciousness of being now the master of  neck or nothing hall was apparent in a boy not yet fifteen  and not only  in himself  but in the grey headed retainers about him  this might be  seen  there was a shade more of deference  the boy was merged in   the  young master    but we must leave the house of mourning for the present   and follow the widow rooney  who  as she tramped her way homeward  was  increasing in hideousness of visage every hour  her nose was twice its  usual dimensions  and one eye was perfectly useless in showing her the  road  at last  however  as evening was closing  she reached her cabin   and there was andy  arrived before her  and telling oonah  his cousin   all his misadventures of the preceding day     the history was stopped for a while by their mutual explanations and  condolences with mrs  rooney  on the  cruel way her poor face was used       and who done it all   said oonah      who but that born divil  matty dwyer  and sure they towld me  you  were  married to her   said she to andy      so i was   said andy  beginning the account of his misfortunes afresh  to his mother  who from time to time would break in with indiscriminate  maledictions on andy  as well as his forsworn damsel  and when  the account was ended  she poured out a torrent of abuse upon her  unfortunate forsaken son  which riveted him to the floor in utter  amazement      i thought i d get pity here  at all events   said poor andy   but  instead o  that it s the worst word and the hardest name in your jaw you  have for me       and sarve you right  you dirty cur   said his mother   i ran off like  a fool when i heerd of your good fortune  and see the condition that  baggage left me in  my teeth knocked in and my eye knocked out  and all  for your foolery  because you couldn t keep what you got       sure  mother  i tell you        howld your tongue  you  omadhaun   and then i go to squire o grady s to  look for you  and there i hear you lost  that  place  too       faix  it s little loss   said andy      that s all you know about it  you goose  you lose the place just when  the man s dead and you d have had a shuit o  mournin   oh  you are the  most misfortunate divil  andy rooney  this day in ireland  why did i  rear you at all       squire o grady dead   said andy  in surprise and also with regret for  his late master      yis  and you ve lost the mournin   augh       oh  the poor squire   said andy      the iligant new clothes   grumbled mrs  rooney   and then luck tumbles  into your way such as man never had  without a place  or a rap to bless  yourself with  you get a rich man s daughter for your wife  and you let  her slip through your fingers       how could i help it   said andy      augh   you bothered the job just the way you do everything   said his  mother      sure i was civil spoken to her       augh   said his mother      and took no liberty       you goose       and called her miss       oh  indeed you missed it altogether       and said i wasn t desarvin  of her       that was thrue   but you should not have towld her so   make a woman  think you re betther than her  and she ll like you       and sure  when i endayvoured to make myself agreeable to her           endayvoured    repeated the old woman contemptuously    endayvoured    indeed  why didn t you  make  yourself agreeable at once  you poor dirty  goose   no  but you went sneaking about it  i know as well as if i was  looking at you  you went sneakin  and snivelin  until the girl took  a disgust to you  for there s nothing a woman despises so much as  shilly shallying       sure  you won t hear my defince   said andy      oh  indeed you re betther at defince than attack   said his mother      sure  the first little civil ty i wanted to pay to her  she took up the  three legged stool to me       the divil mend you  and what civil ty did you offer her       i made a grab at her cap  and i thought she d have brained me      oonah set up such a shout of laughter at andy s notion of civility to  a girl  that the conversation was stopped for some time  and her aunt  remonstrated with her at her want of common sense  or  as she said   hadn t she  more decency than to laugh at the poor fool s nonsense       what could i do agen the three legged stool   said andy      where was your  own  legs  and your own arms  and your own eyes  and  your own tongue   eh       and sure i tell you it was all ready conthrived  and james casey was  sent for  and came       yis   said the mother   but not for a long time  you towld me yourself   and what were you doing all that time  sure  supposing you  wor  only a  new acquaintance  any man worth a day s mate would have discoorsed her  over in the time and made her sinsible he was the best of husbands       i tell you she wouldn t let me have her ear at all   said andy   nor  her cap either   said oonah  laughing      and then jim casey kem       and why did you let him in       it was  she  let him in  i tell you       and why did you let her  he was on the wrong side of the door  that s  the  outside   and you on the right  that s the  inside   and it was   your  house  and she was  your  wife  and you were her masther  and  you had the rights of the church  and the rights of the law  and all the  rights on your side  barrin  right rayson  that you never had  and sure  without  that   what s the use of all the other rights in the world       sure  hadn t he his friends   sthrong   outside       no matther  if the door wasn t opened to them  for  then  you would  have had a stronger friend than any o  them present among them       who   inquired andy      the  hangman   answered his mother   for breaking doors is hanging  matther  and i say the presence of the hangman s always before people  when they have such a job to do  and makes them think twice sometimes  before they smash once  and so you had only to keep one woman s hands  quiet       faix  some of them would smash a door as soon as not   said andy      well  then  you d have the satisfaction of hanging them   said the  mother   and that would be some consolation  but even as it is  i ll  have law for it  i will  for the property is yours  any how  though the  girl is gone  and indeed a brazen baggage she is  and is mighty heavy  in the hand  oh  my poor eye   it s like a coal of fire  but sure it was  worth the risk living with her for the sake of the purty property  and  sure i was thinkin  what a pleasure it would be living with you  and  tachin  your wife housekeepin   and bringing up the young turkeys and  the childhre  but  och hone  you ll never do a bit o  good  you that got  sitch careful bringin  up  andy rooney  didn t i tache you manners   you dirty hanginbone blackguard  didn t i tache you your blessed  religion   may the divil sweep you  did i ever prevent you from sharing  the lavings of the pratees with the pig   and didn t you often clane out  the pot with him  and you re no good afther all  i ve turned my honest  penny by the pig  but i ll never make my money of  you   andy rooney      there was some minutes  silence after this eloquent outbreak of andy s  mother  which was broken at last by andy uttering a long sigh and an  ejaculation      och  it s a fine thing to be a gintleman   said andy      cock you up   said his mother   maybe it s a gintleman you want to be   what puts that in your head  you  omadhaun        why  because a gintleman has no hardships  compared with one of uz   sure  if a gintleman was married  his wife wouldn t be tuk off from him  the way mine was       not so soon  maybe   said the mother  drily      and if a gintleman brakes a horse s heart  he s only a   bowld rider     while a poor sarvant is a  careless blackguard  for only taking a  sweat out of him  if a gintleman dhrinks till he can t see a hole in a  laddher  he s only   feesh   but   dhrunk   is the word for a poor man   and if a gintleman kicks up a row  he s a  fine sperited fellow   while  a poor man is a  disordherly vagabone  for the same  and the justice  axes the one to dinner and sends th  other to jail  oh  faix  the law  is a dainty lady  she takes people by the hand who can afford to wear  gloves  but people with brown fists must keep their distance       i often remark   said his mother   that fools spake mighty sinsible  betimes  but their wisdom all goes with their gab  why didn t you take  a betther grip of your luck when you had it  you re wishing you wor  a gintleman  and yet when you had the best part of a gintleman  the  property  i mane  put into your way  you let it slip through your  fingers  and afther lettin  a fellow take a rich wife from you and turn  you out of your own house  you sit down on a stool there  and begin to   wish  indeed   you sneakin  fool  wish  indeed  och  if you wish with  one hand  and wash with th  other  which will be clane first  eh       what could i do agen eight   asked andy      why did you let them in  i say again   said the mother  quickly      sure the blame wasn t with me   said andy   but with        whisht  whisht  you goose   said his mother   av course you ll blame  every one and everything but yourself    the losing horse blames the  saddle         well  maybe it s all for the best   said andy   afther all       augh  howld your tongue       and if it  wasn t  to be  how could it be       listen to him       and providence is over us all       oh  yis   said the mother   when fools make mistakes they lay the blame  on providence  how have you the impidence to talk o  providence in that  manner   i ll  tell you where the providence was  providence sent you to  jack dwyer s  and kep jim casey away  and put the anger into owld jack s  heart  that s what the providence did   and made the opening for you to  spake up  and gave you a wife  a wife with  property   ah  there s where  the providence was   and you were the masther of a snug house  that was  providence  and wouldn t myself have been the one to be helping you  in the farm  rearing the powlts  milkin  the cow  makin  the iligant  butther  with lavings of butthermilk for the pigs  the sow thriving  and  the cocks and hens cheering your heart with their cacklin   the hank  o  yarn on the wheel  and a hank of ingins up the chimbley  oh  there s  where the providence would have been  that  would have been providence  indeed    but never tell me that providence turned you out of the house    that  was your own  goostherumfoodle        can t he take the law o  them  aunt   inquired oonah      to be sure he can  and shall  too   said the mother   i ll be off to   torney murphy to morrow  i ll pursue her for my eye  and andy for the  property  and i ll put them all in chancery  the villains       it s newgate they ought to be put in   said andy      tut  you fool  chancery is worse than newgate  for people sometimes get  out of newgate  but they never get out of chancery  i hear      as mrs  rooney spoke  the latch of the door was raised  and a miserably  clad woman entered  closed the door immediately after her  and placed  the bar against it  the action attracted the attention of all the  inmates of the house  for the doors of the peasantry are universally   left on the latch   and never secured against intrusion until the  family go to bed      god save all here   said the woman  as she approached the fire      oh  is that you  ragged nance   said mrs  rooney  for that was the  unenviable but descriptive title the new comer was known by  and though  she knew it for her  soubriquet   yet she also knew mrs  rooney would  not call her by it if she were not in an ill temper  so she began humbly  to explain the cause of her visit  when mrs  rooney broke in gruffly       oh  you always make out a good rayson for coming  but we have nothing  for you to night       throth  you do me wrong   said the beggar   if you think i came   shooling    footnote  going on chance here and there  to pick up what  one can   it s only to keep harm from the innocent girl here       arrah  what harm would happen her  woman   returned the widow   savagely  rendered more morose by the humble bearing of her against whom  she directed her severity  as if she got more angry the less the poor  creature would give her cause to justify her harshness   isn t she  undher my roof here       but how long may she be left there   asked the woman  significantly      what do you mane  woman       i mane there s a plan to carry her off from you to night      oonah grew pale with true terror  and the widow screeched  after the  more approved manner of elderly ladies making believe they are very much  shocked  till nance reminded her that crying would do no good  and  that it was requisite to make some preparation against the approaching  danger  various plans were hastily suggested  and as hastily  relinquished  till nance advised a measure which was deemed the best  it  was to dress andy in female attire and let him be carried off in place  of the girl  andy roared with laughter at the notion of being made a  girl of  and said the trick would instantly be seen through      not if you act your part well  just keep down the giggle  jewel  and  put on a moderate  phillelew   and do the thing nice and steady  and  you ll be the saving of your cousin here        you  may deceive them with the dhress  and  i  may do a bit of a small   shilloo   like a  colleen  in disthress  and that s all very well    said andy   as far as seeing and hearing goes  but when they come to  grip me  sure they ll find out in a minute       we ll stuff you out well with rags and sthraw  and they ll never know  the differ  besides  remember  the fellow that wants a girl never comes  for her himself   footnote  this is mostly the case   but sends his  friends for her  and they won t know the differ  besides  they re all  dhrunk       how do you know       because they re always dhrunk  that same crew  and if they re not  dhrunk to night  it s the first time in their lives they ever were  sober  so make haste  now  and put off your coat  till we make a purty  young colleen out o  you      it occurred now to the widow that it was a service of great danger andy  was called on to perform  and with all her abuse of   omadhaun   she  did not like the notion of putting him in the way of losing his life   perhaps      they ll murdher the boy  maybe  when they find out the chate   said the  widow      not a bit   said nance      and suppose they did   said andy   i d rather die  sure  than the  disgrace should fall upon oonah  there       god bless you  andy dear   said oonah   sure  you have the kind heart   anyhow  but i wouldn t for the world hurt or harm should come to you on  my account       oh  don t be afeard   said andy  cheerily   divil a hair i value all  they can do  so dhress me up at once      after some more objections on the part of his mother  which andy  overruled  the women all joined in making up andy into as tempting  an imitation of feminality as they could contrive  but to bestow the  roundness of outline on the angular form of andy was no easy matter   and required more rags than the house afforded  so some straw was  indispensable  which the pig s bed only could supply  in the midst of  their fears  the women could not help laughing as they effected some  likeness to their own forms  with their stuffing and padding  but  to carry off the width of andy s shoulders required a very ample and  voluptuous outline indeed  and andy could not help wishing the straw  was a little sweeter which they were packing under his nose  at last   however  after soaping down his straggling hair on his forehead  and  tying a bonnet upon his head to shade his face as much as possible  the  disguise was completed  and the next move was to put oonah in a place of  safety      get upon the hurdle in the corner  under the thatch   said nance      oh  i d be afeard o  my life to stay in the house at all       you d be safe enough  i tell you   said nance   for once they see that  fine young woman there   pointing to andy  and laughing   they ll be  satisfied with the lob we ve made for them      oonah still expressed her fear of remaining in the cabin      then hide in the pratee trench  behind the house       that s better   said oonah      and now i must be going   said nance   for they must not see me when  they come       oh  don t leave me  nance dear   cried oonah   for i m sure i ll faint  with the fright when i hear them coming  if some one is not with me      nance yielded to oonah s fears and entreaties  and with many a blessing  and boundless thanks for the beggar woman s kindness  oonah led the  way to the little potato garden at the back of the house  and there  the women squatted themselves in one of the trenches and awaited the  impending event      illustration  the abduction     it was not long in arriving  the tramp of approaching horses at a sharp  pace rang through the stillness of the night  and the women  crouching  flat beneath the overspreading branches of the potato tops  lay  breathless in the bottom of the trench  as the riders came up to the  widow s cottage and entered  there they found the widow and her pseudo  niece sitting at the fire  and three drunken vagabonds  for the fourth  was holding the horses outside  cut some fantastic capers round the  cabin  and making a mock obeisance to the widow  the spokesman addressed  her with       your sarvant  ma am       who are yiz at all  gintleman  that comes to my place at this time o   night  and what s your business       we want the loan o  that young woman there  ma am   said the ruffian     andy and his mother both uttered small squalls      and as for who we are  ma am  we re the blessed society of saint  joseph  ma am  our coat of arms is two heads upon one pillow  and our  motty   who s afraid   hurroo    shouted the savage  and he twirled his  stick and cut another caper  then coming up to andy  he addressed him  as  young woman   and said there was a fine strapping fellow whose heart  was breaking till he  rowled her in his arms      andy and the mother both acted their parts very well  he rushed to the  arms of the old woman for protection  and screeched small  while the  widow shouted   millia murther    at the top of her voice  and did not  give up her hold of the make believe young woman until her cap was torn  half off  and her hair streamed about her face  she called on all the  saints in the calendar  as she knelt in the middle of the floor and  rocked to and fro  with her clasped hands raised to heaven  calling down  curses on the  villains and robbers  that were tearing her child from  her  while they threatened to stop her breath altogether if she did not  make less noise  and in the midst of the uproar dragged off andy  whose  struggles and despair might have excited the suspicion of soberer men   they lifted him up on a stout horse  in front of the most powerful man  of the party  who gripped andy hard round the middle and pushed his  horse to a hand gallop  followed by the rest of the party  the proximity  of andy to his  cavaliero  made the latter sensible to the bad odour  of the pig s bed  which formed andy s luxurious bust and bustle  but he  attributed the unsavoury scent to a bad breath on the lady s part  and  would sometimes address his charge thus        young woman  if you plaze  would you turn your face th  other way    then in a side soliloquy   by jaker  i wondher at jack s taste  she s  a fine lump of a girl  but her breath is murther intirely  phew  young  woman  turn away your face  or by this and that i ll fall off the horse   i ve heerd of a bad breath that might knock a man down  but i never met  it till now  oh  murther  it s worse it s growin   i suppose  t is the  bumpin  she s gettin  that shakes the breath out of her sthrong  oh   there it is again  phew      it was as well  perhaps  for the prosecution of the deceit  that the  distaste the fellow conceived for his charge prevented any closer  approaches to andy s visage  which might have dispelled the illusion  under which he still pushed forward to the hills and bumped poor andy  towards the termination of his ride  keeping a sharp look out as he went  along  andy soon was able to perceive they were making for that wild  part of the hills where he had discovered the private still on the night  of his temporary fright and imaginary rencontre with the giants  and the  conversation he partly overheard all recurred to him  and he saw at once  that oonah was the person alluded to  whose name he could not catch  a  circumstance that cost him many a conjecture in the interim  this gave  him a clue to the persons into whose power he was about to fall  after  having so far defeated their scheme  and he saw he should have to deal  with very desperate and lawless parties  remembering  moreover  the  herculean frame of the inamorato  he calculated on an awful thrashing as  the smallest penalty he should have to pay for deceiving him  but was   nevertheless  determined to go through the adventure with a good heart   to make deceit serve his turn as long as he might  and at the last  if  necessary  to make the best fight he could     as it happened  luck favoured andy in his adventure  for the hero of the  blunderbuss  and he  it will be remembered  was the love sick gentleman   drank profusely on the night in question  quaffing deep potations to  the health of his oonah  wishing luck to his friends and speed to their  horses  and every now and then ascending the ladder from the cave  and  looking out for the approach of the party  on one of these occasions   from the unsteadiness of the ladder  or himself  or perhaps both  his  foot slipped  and he came to the ground with a heavy fall  in which his  head received so severe a blow that he became insensible  and it was  some time before his sister  who was an inhabitant of this den  could  restore him to consciousness  this she did  however  and the savage  recovered all the senses the whisky had left him  but still the stunning  effect of the fall cooled his courage considerably  and  as it were    bothered  him so  that he felt much less of the  gallant gay lothario   than he had done before the accident     the tramp of horses was heard overhead ere long  and  shan more   or  big john  as the hercules was called  told bridget to go up to  the  darlin    and help her down      for that s a blackguard laddher   said he   it turned undher me like  an eel  bad luck to it   tell her i d go up myself  only the ground is  slipping from undher me  and the laddher       bridget went off  leaving jack growling forth anathemas against the  ground and the ladder  and returned speedily with the mock lady and her  attendant squires      oh  my jewel   roared jack  as he caught sight of his prize  he  scrambled up on his legs  and made a rush at andy  who imitated a  woman s scream and fright at the expected embrace  but it was with much  greater difficulty he suppressed his laughter at the headlong fall with  which big jack plunged his head into a heap of turf   footnote  peat   and hugged a sack of malt which lay beside it     andy endeavoured to overcome the provocation to merriment by screeching   and as bridget caught the sound of this tendency towards laughter  between the screams  she thought it was the commencement of a fit  of hysterics  and it accounted all the better for andy s extravagant  antics      oh  the craythur is frightened out of her life   said bridget   leave  her to me   said she to the men   there  jewel machree   she continued  to andy  soothingly   don t take on you that way  don t be afeerd   you re among friends  jack is only dhrunk dhrinking your health   darlin   but he adores you   andy screeched      but don t be afeerd  you ll be thrated tender  and he ll marry you   darlin   like an honest woman      andy squalled      but not to night  jewel  don t be frightened      andy gave a heavy sob at the respite      boys  will you lift jack out o  the turf  and carry him up into the  air   t will be good for him  and this dacent girl will sleep with me  to night      andy couldn t resist a laugh at this  and bridget feared the girl was  going off into hysterics again      aisy  dear  aisy  sure you ll be safe with me       ow  ow  ow   shouted andy      oh  murther   cried bridget   the sterricks will be the death of her   you blackguards  you frightened her coming up here  i m sure      the men swore they behaved in the genteelest manner   well  take away  jack  and the girl shall have share of my bed for this night      andy shook internally with laughter      dear  dear  how she thrimbles   cried bridget   don t be so frightful    lanna machree   there  now  they re taking jack away  and you re alone  with myself and will have a nice sleep      the men all the time were removing  shan more  to upper air  and the  last sounds they heard as they left the cave were the coaxing tones of  bridget s voice  inviting andy  in the softest words  to go to bed           chapter xxxv      the workshops of neck or nothing hall rang with the sounds of occupation  for two days after the demise of its former master  the hoarse grating  sound of the saw  the whistling of the plane  and the stroke of the  mallet denoted the presence of the carpenter  and the sharper clink of  a hammer told of old fogy  the family  milliner   being at work  but  it was not on millinery fogy was now employed  though neither was it  legitimate tinker s work  he was scrolling out with his shears  and  beating into form  a plate of tin  to serve for the shield on o grady s  coffin  which was to record his name  age  and day of departure  and  this was the second plate on which the old man worked  for one was  already finished in the corner  why are there two coffin plates  enter  the carpenter s shop  and you will see the answer in two coffins the  carpenter has nearly completed  but why two coffins for one death   listen  reader  to a bit of irish strategy     it has been stated that an apprehension was entertained of a seizure of  the inanimate body of o grady for the debts it had contracted in life   and the harpy nature of the money lender from whom this movement was  dreaded warranted the fear  had o grady been popular  such a measure on  the part of a cruel creditor might have been defied  as the surrounding  peasantry would have risen  en masse  to prevent it  but the hostile  position in which he had placed himself towards the people alienated the  natural affection they are born with for their chiefs  and any partial  defence the few fierce retainers whom individual interest had attached  to him could have made might have been insufficient  therefore  to save  his father s remains from the pollution  as the son considered  of a  bailiff s touch  gustavus determined to achieve by stratagem what he  could not accomplish by force  and had two coffins constructed  the one  to be filled with stones and straw  and sent out by the front entrance  with all the demonstration of a real funeral  and be given up to the  attack it was feared would be made upon it while the other  put to its  legitimate use  should be placed on a raft  and floated down the river  to an ancient burial ground which lay some miles below on the opposite  bank  a facility for this was afforded by a branch of the river running  up into the domain  as it will be remembered  and the scene of the  bearish freaks played upon furlong was to witness a trick of a more  serious nature     while all these preparations were going forward  the  waking  was kept  up in all the barbarous style of old times  eating and drinking in  profusion went on in the house  and the kitchen of the hall rang with  joviality  the feats of sports and arms of the man who had passed  away were lauded  and his comparative achievements with those of  his progenitors gave rise to many a stirring anecdote  and bursts of  barbarous exultation  or more barbarous merriment  rang in the house  of death  there was no lack of whisky to fire the brains of these  revellers  for the standard of the measurement of family grandeur was   too often  a liquid one in ireland  even so recently as the time we  speak of  and the dozens of wine wasted during the life it helped to  shorten  and the posthumous gallons consumed in toasting to the memory  of the departed  were among the cherished remembrances of hereditary  honour   there were two hogsheads of whisky drank at my father s wake    was but a moderate boast of a true irish squire  fifty years ago     and now the last night of the wake approached  and the retainers  thronged to honour the obsequies of their departed chief with an  increased enthusiasm  which rose in proportion as the whisky got low   and songs in praise of their present occupation  that is  getting  drunk  rang merrily round  and the sports of the field and the sorrows  and joys of love resounded  in short  the ruling passions of life  figured in rhyme and music in honour of this occasion of death  and as  death is the maker of widows  a very animated discussion on the subject  of widowhood arose  which afforded great scope for the rustic wits  and  was crowned by the song of  widow machree  being universally called for  by the company  and a fine looking fellow with a merry eye and large  white teeth  which he amply displayed by a wide mouth  poured forth in  cheery tones a pretty lively air which suited well the humorous spirit  of the words       widow machree       widow  machree   it s no wonder you frown       och hone  widow machree      faith  it ruins your looks  that same dirty black gown       och hone  widow machree     how

     widow machree  now the summer is come       och hone  widow machree     when everything smiles  should a beauty look glum       och hone  widow machree     see the birds go in pairs     and the rabbits and hares      why even the bears      now in couples agree     and the mute little fish     though they can t spake  they wish       och hone  widow machree        widow machree  and when winter comes in       och hone  widow machree     to be poking the fire all alone is a sin       och hone  widow machree     sure the shovel and tongs    to each other belongs     and the kittle sings

without thinking to see    some ghost or some sprite     that would wake you each night       crying   och hone  widow machree         then take my advice  darling widow machree       och hone  widow machree     and with my advice   faith i wish you d take me       och hone  widow machree     you d have me to desire    then to sit by the fire     and sure hope is no liar      in whispering to me    that the ghosts would depart     when you d me near your heart       och hone  widow machree      the singer was honoured with a round of applause  and his challenge for  another lay was readily answered  and mirth and music filled the night  and ushered in the dawn of the day which was to witness the melancholy  sight of the master of an ample mansion being made the tenant of the   narrow house      in the evening of that day  however  the wail rose loud and long  the  mirth which  the waking  permits had passed away  and the  ulican   or  funeral cry  told that the lifeless chief was being borne from his hall   that wild cry was heard even by the party who were waiting to make their  horrid seizure  and for  that  party the stone laden coffin was sent  with a retinue of mourners through the old iron gate of the principal  entrance  while the mortal remains were borne by a smaller party to the  river inlet and placed on the raft  half an hour had witnessed a sham  fight on the part of o grady s people with the bailiffs and their  followers  who made the seizure they intended  and locked up their prize  in an old barn to which it had been conveyed  until some engagement on  the part of the heir should liberate it  while the aforesaid heir  as  soon as the shadows of evening had shrouded the river in obscurity   conveyed the remains  which the myrmidons of the law fancied they  possessed  to its quiet and lonely resting place  the raft was taken  in tow by a boat carrying two of the boys  and pulled by four lusty  retainers of the departed chief  while gustavus himself stood on the  raft  astride over the coffin  and with an eel spear  which had afforded  him many a day s sport  performed the melancholy task of guiding it   it was a strangely painful yet beautiful sight to behold the graceful  figure of the fine boy engaged in this last sad duty  with dexterous  energy he plied his spear  now on this side and now on that  directing  the course of the raft  or clearing it from the flaggers which  interrupted its passage through the narrow inlet  this duty he had to  attend to for some time  even after leaving the little inlet  for the  river was much overgrown with flaggers at this point  and the increasing  darkness made the task more difficult     in the midst of all this action not one word was spoken  even the sturdy  boatmen were mute  and the fall of the oar in the rowlock  the plash of  the water  and the crushing sound of the yielding rushes as the  watery  bier  made its way through them were the only sounds which broke the  silence  still gustavus betrayed no emotion  but by the time they  reached the open stream  and that his personal exertion was no longer  required  a change came over him  it was night   the measured beat of  the oars sounded like a knell to him  there was darkness above him and  death below  and he sank down upon the coffin  and plunging his face  passionately between his hands  he wept bitterly  sad were the thoughts  that oppressed the brain and wrung the heart of the high spirited  boy  he felt that his dead father was  escaping   as it were  to  the grave   that even death did not terminate the consequences of an  ill spent life  he felt like a thief in the night  even in the execution  of his own stratagem  and the bitter thoughts of that sad and solemn  time wrought a potent spell over after years  that one hour of misery  and disgrace influenced the entire of a future life     on a small hill overhanging the river was the ruin of an ancient early  temple of christianity  and to its surrounding burial ground a few of  the retainers had been despatched to prepare a grave  they were engaged  in this task by the light of a torch made of bog pine  when the flicker  of the flame attracted the eye of a horseman who was riding slowly along  the neighbouring road  wondering what could be the cause of light  in such a place  he leaped the adjoining fence and rode up to the  grave yard      what are you doing here   he said to the labourers  they paused and  looked up  and the flash of the torch fell upon the features of  edward o connor   we re finishing your work   said one of the men with  malicious earnestness      my work   repeated edward      yes   returned the man  more sternly than before   this is the grave of  o grady      the words went like an ice bolt through edward s heart  and even by the  torchlight the tormentor could see his victim grew livid     the fellow who wounded so deeply one so generally beloved as edward  o connor was a thorough ruffian  his answer to edward s query sprang not  from love of o grady  nor abhorrence of taking human life  but from the  opportunity of retort which the occasion offered upon one who had once  checked him in an act of brutality     yet edward o connor could not reply  it was a home thrust  the death  of o grady had weighed heavily upon him  for though o grady s wound  had been given in honourable combat  provoked by his own fury  and not  producing immediate death  though that death had supervened upon the  subsequent intractability of the patient  yet the fact that o grady had  never been  up and doing  since the duel tended to give the impression  that his wound was the remote if not the immediate cause of his death   and this circumstance weighed heavily on edward s spirits  his friends  told him he felt over keenly upon the subject  and that no one but  himself could entertain a question of  his  total innocence of o grady s  death  but when from the lips of a common peasant he got the answer  he did  and  that  beside the grave of his adversary  it will not be  wondered at that he reeled in his saddle  a cold shivering sickness  came over him  and to avoid falling he alighted and leaned for support  against his horse  which stooped  when freed from the restraint of the  rein  to browse on the rank verdure  and for a moment edward envied the  unconsciousness of the animal against which he leaned  he pressed his  forehead against the saddle  and from the depth of a bleeding heart came  up an agonised exclamation     a gentle hand was laid on his shoulder as he spoke  and  turning round   he beheld mr  bermingham      what brings you here   said the clergyman      accident   answered edward   but why should i say accident   it is by a  higher authority and a better  it is the will of heaven  it is meant as  a bitter lesson to human pride  we make for ourselves laws of  honour    and forget the laws of god       be calm  my young friend   said the worthy pastor   i cannot wonder you  feel deeply  but command yourself   he pressed edward s hand as he spoke  and left him  for he knew that an agony so keen is not benefited by  companionship     mr  bermingham was there by appointment to perform the burial service   and he had not left edward s side many minutes when a long wild whistle  from the waters announced the arrival of the boat and raft  and the  retainers ran down to the river  leaving the pine torch stuck in the  upturned earth  waving its warm blaze over the cold grave  during  the interval which ensued between the departure of the men and their  reappearance  bearing the body to its last resting place  mr  bermingham  spoke with edward o connor  and soothed him into a more tranquil  bearing  when the coffin came within view he advanced to meet it  and  began the sublime burial service  which he repeated most impressively   when it was over  the men commenced filling up the grave  as the clods  fell upon the coffin  they smote the hearts of the dead man s children   yet the boys stood upon the verge of the grave as long as a vestige  of the tenement of their lost father could be seen  but as soon as the  coffin was hidden  they withdrew from the brink  and the younger boys   each taking hold of the hand of the eldest  seemed to imply the need  of mutual dependence   as if death had drawn closer the bond of  brotherhood     there was no sincerer mourner at that place than edward o connor  who  stood aloof  in respect for the feelings of the children of the departed  man  till the grave was quite filled up  and all were about to leave the  spot  but then his feelings overmastered him  and  impelled by a torrent  of contending emotions  he rushed forward  and throwing himself on his  knees before gustavus  he held up his hands imploringly  and sobbed  forth   forgive me      the astonished boy drew back      oh  forgive me   repeated edward   i could not help it  it was forced  on me  it was       as he struggled for utterance  even the rough retainers were touched   and one of them exclaimed   oh  mr  o connor  it was a fair fight       there   exclaimed edward   you hear it  oh  give me your hand in  forgiveness       i forgive you   said the boy   but do not ask me to give you my hand  to night       you are right  said edward  springing to his feet   you are right  you  are a noble fellow  and now  remember my parting words  gustavus   here   by the side of your father s grave  i pledge you my soul that through  life and till death  in all extremity  edward o connor is your sworn and  trusty friend            chapter xxxvi      while the foregoing scene of sadness took place in the lone churchyard   unholy watch was kept over the second coffin by the myrmidons of the  law  the usurer who made the seizure had brought down from dublin three  of the most determined bailiffs from amongst the tribe  and to their  care was committed the keeping of the supposed body in the old barn   associated with these worthies were a couple of ill conditioned country  blackguards  who  for the sake of a bottle of whisky  would keep company  with old nick himself  and who expected  moreover  to hear  a power  o  news  from the  gentlemen  from dublin  who  in their turn did not  object to have their guard strengthened  as their notions of a rescue in  the country parts of ireland were anything but agreeable  the night was  cold  so  clearing away from one end of the barn the sheaves of corn  with which it was stored  they made a turf fire  stretched themselves  on a good shake down of straw before the cheering blaze  and circulated  among them the whisky  of which they had a good store  a tap at the  door announced a new comer  but the dublin bailiffs  fearing a surprise   hesitated to open to the knock until their country allies assured them  it was a friend whose voice they recognised  the door was opened  and in  walked larry hogan  to pick up his share of what was going  whatever it  might be  saying       i thought you wor for keeping me out altogether       the gintlemin from dublin was afeard of what they call a riskya    rescue   said the peasant   till i told them  t was a friend       divil a riskya will come near you to night   said larry   you may make  your minds aisy about that  for the people doesn t care enough about   his  bones to get their own broke in savin  him  and no wondher  it s  a lantherumswash bully he always was  quiet as he is now  and there you  are  my bold squire   said he  apostrophising the coffin which had  been thrown on a heap of sheaves   faix  it s a good kitchen you kep    anyhow  whenever you had it to spind  and indeed when you  hadn t  you  spint it all the same  for the divil a much you cared how you got  it  but death has made you pay the reckoning at last  that thing that  filly officers call the debt o  nature must be paid  whatever else you  may owe       why  it s as good as a sarmon to hear you   said one of the bailiffs    o larry  sir  discourses iligant   said a peasant      tut  tut  tut   said larry  with affected modesty   it s not what  i   say  but i can tell you a thing that docthor growlin  put out on him  more nor a year ago  which was mighty  cute  scholars calls it an   epithet of dissipation   which means getting a man s tombstone ready  for him before he dies  and divil a more cutting thing was ever cut on a  tombstone than the doctor s rhyme  this is it         here lies o grady  that cantankerous creature     who paid  as all must pay  the debt of nature     but  keeping to his general maxim still     paid it  like other debts  against his will        footnote  these bitter lines on a  bad pay  were written by a dublin  medical wit of high repute  of whom dr  growling is a prototype       what do  you  think o  that  goggins   inquired one bailiff from the  other   you re a judge o  po thry       it s  sevare    answered goggins  authoritatively   but  coorse   i  wish you d brile the rashers  i begin to feel the calls o  nature  as  the poet says      this mister goggins was a character in his way  he had the greatest  longing to be thought a poet  put execrable couplets together  sometimes  and always talked as fine as he could  and his mixture of  sentimentality  with a large stock of blackguardism  produced a strange  jumble      the people here thought it nate  sir   said larry      oh  very well for the country   said goggins   but  t wouldn t do for  town       misther coggings knows best   said the bailiff who first spoke   for  he s a pote himself  and writes in the newspapers       oh  indeed   said larry      yes   said goggins   sometimes i throw off little things for the  newspapers  there s a friend of mine you see  a gentleman connected with  the press  who is often in defficulties  and i give him a hint to keep  out o  the way when he s in trouble  and he swears i ve a genus for the  muses  and encourages me        humph   says larry      and puts my things in the paper  when he gets the editor s back turned   for the editor is a consaited chap that likes no one s po thry but his  own  but never mind  if i ever get a writ against that chap   won t  i  sarve it       and i dar say some day you will have it agen him  sir   said larry      sure of it  a most   said goggins   them litherary men is always in  defficulties       i wondher you d be like them  then  and write at all   said larry      oh  as for me  it s only by way of amusement  attached as i am to the  legal profession  my time wouldn t permit  but i have been infected by  the company i kept  the living images that creeps over a man sometimes  is irresistible  and you have no pace till you get them out o  your  head       oh  indeed  they are very throublesome   says larry   and are the  litherary gintlemen  sir  as you call them  mostly that way       to be sure  it is  that  which makes a litherary man  his head is  full  teems with creation  sir       dear  dear   said larry      and when once the itch of litherature comes over a man  nothing can  cure it but the scratching of a pen       but if you have not a pen  i suppose you must scratch any other way you  can       to be sure   said goggins   i have seen a litherary gentleman in a  sponging house do crack things on the wall with a bit of burnt stick   rather than be idle  they must execute       ha   says larry      sometimes  in all their poverty and difficulty  i envy the  fatal  fatality   as the poet says  of such men in catching ideas       that s the genteel name for it   says larry      oh   exclaimed goggins  enthusiastically   i know the satisfaction of  catching a man  but it s nothing at all compared to catching an idea   for the man  you see  can give hail and get off  but the idea is your  own for ever  and then a rhyme  when it has puzzled you all day  the  pleasure you have in  nabbing  it at last       oh  it s po thry you re spakin  about   said larry      to be sure   said goggins   do you think i d throw away my time on  prose  you re burning that bacon  tim   said he to his  sub       poethry  agen the world   continued he to larry   the castilian  sthraime for me   hand us that whisky   he put the bottle to his mouth  and took a swig   that s good  you do a bit of private here  i suspect    said he  with a wink  pointing to the bottle     larry returned a significant grin  but said nothing  oh  don t be afraid  o  me  i would n t peach        sure it s agen the law  and you re a gintleman o  the law   said larry      that s no rule   said goggins   the lord chief justice always goes to  bed  they say  with six tumblers o  potteen under his belt  and dhrink  it myself       arrah  how do you get it   said larry      from a gentleman  a friend o  mine  in the custom house       a dad  that s quare   said larry  laughing      oh  we see queer things  i tell you   said goggins   we gentlemen of  the law       to be sure you must   returned larry   and mighty improvin  it must be   did you ever catch a thief  sir       my good man  you mistake my profession   said goggins  proudly   we  never have anything to do in the  criminal  line  that s much beneath   us        i ax your pardon  sir       no offence  no offence       but it must be mighty improvin   i think  ketching of thieves  and  finding out their thricks and hidin  places  and the like       yes  yes   said goggins   good fun  though i don t do it  i know all  about it  and could tell queer things too       arrah  maybe you would  sir   said larry      maybe i will  after we nibble some rashers  will you take share       musha  long life to you   said larry  always willing to get whatever he  could  a repast was now made  more resembling a feast of savages round  their war fire than any civilised meal  slices of bacon broiled in  the fire  and eggs roasted in the turf ashes  the viands were not  objectionable  but the cooking  oh   there was neither gridiron nor  frying pan  fork nor spoon  a couple of clasp knives served the whole  party  nevertheless  they satisfied their hunger and then sent the  bottle on its exhilarating round  soon after that  many a story of  burglary  robbery  swindling  petty larceny  and every conceivable  crime  was related for the amusement of the circle  and the plots  and counterplots of thieves and thief takers raised the wonder of the  peasants  larry hogan was especially delighted  more particularly when  some trick of either villany or cunning came out      now women are troublesome cattle to deal with mostly   said goggins    they are remarkably  cute first  and then they are spiteful after   and for circumventin   either  way are sharp hands  you see they do it  quieter than men  a man will make a noise about it  but a woman does  it all on the sly  there was bill morgan  and a sharp fellow he was   too  and he had set his heart on some silver spoons he used to see down  in a kitchen windy  but the servant maid  somehow or other  suspected  there was designs about the place  and was on the watch  well  one  night  when she was all alone  she heard a noise outside the windy  so  she kept as quiet as a mouse  by and by the sash was attempted to be  riz from the outside  so she laid hold of a kittle of boiling wather and  stood hid behind the shutter  the windy was now riz a little  and a hand  and arm thrust in to throw up the sash altogether  when the girl poured  the boiling wather down the sleeve of bill s coat  bill roared with  the pain  when the girl said to him  laughing  through the windy   i   thought  you came for something        that was a  cute girl   said larry  chuckling      well  now  that s an instance of a woman s cleverness in preventing   i ll teach you one of her determination to discover and prosecute to  conviction  and in this case  what makes it curious is  that jack tate  had done the bowldest thing  and run the greatest risks   the  eminent deadly   as the poet says  when he was done up at last by a  feather bed       a feather bed   repeated larry  wondering how a feather bed could  influence the fate of a bold burglar  while goggins mistook his  exclamation of surprise to signify the paltriness of the prize  and  therefore chimed in with him      quite true  no wonder you wonder  quite below a man of his pluck  but  the fact was  a sweetheart of his was longing for a feather bed  and  jack determined to get it  well  he marched into a house  the door of  which he found open  and went up stairs  and took the best feather bed  in the house  tied it up in the best quilt  crammed some caps and  ribbons he saw lying about into the bundle  and marched down stairs  again  but you see  in carrying off even the small thing of a  feather bed  jack showed the skill of a high practitioner  for he  descendhered the stairs backwards       backwards   said larry   what was that for       you ll see by and by   said goggins   he descendhered backwards when  suddenly he heard a door opening  and a faymale voice exclaim   where  are you going with that bed        i am going up stairs with it  ma am   says jack  whose backward  position favoured his lie  and he began to walk up again       come down here   said the lady   we want no beds here  man        mr  sullivan  ma am  sent me home with it himself   said jack  still  mounting the stairs       come down  i tell you   said the lady  in a great rage   there s  no mr  sullivan lives here  go out of this with your bed  you stupid  fellow        i beg your pardon  ma am   says jack  turning round  and marching off  with the bed fair and aisy  well  there was a regular shilloo in the  house when the thing was found out  and cart ropes wouldn t howld the  lady for the rage she was in at being diddled  so she offered rewards   and the dickens knows all  and what do you think at last discovered our  poor jack       the sweetheart  maybe   said larry  grinning in ecstasy at the thought  of human perfidy      no   said goggins   honour even among sweethearts  though they do the  trick sometimes  i confess  but no woman of any honour would betray a  great man like jack  no   t was one of the paltry ribbons that brought  conviction home to him  the woman never lost sight of hunting up  evidence about her feather bed  and  in the end  a ribbon out of one of  her caps settled the hash of jack tate      from robbings they went on to tell of murders  and at last that  uncomfortable sensation which people experience after a feast of horrors  began to pervade the party  and whenever they looked round   there  was  the coffin in the background      throw some turf on the fire   said goggins    t is burning low   and change the subject  the tragic muse has reigned sufficiently  long  enough of the dagger and the bowl  sink the socks and put on the  buckskins  leather away  jim  sing us a song       what is it to be   asked jim      oh  that last song of the solicitor general s   said goggins  with an  air as if the solicitor general were his particular friend      about the robbery   inquired jim      to be sure   returned goggins      dear me   said larry   and would so grate a man as the  solicithor general demane himself by writin  about robbers       oh   said goggins   those in the heavy profession of the law must have  their little private moments of rollickzation  and then high men  you  see  like to do a bit of low by way of variety   the night before larry  was stretched  was done by a bishop  they say  and  lord altamont s  bull  by the lord chief justice  and the solicitor general is as up to  fun as any bishop of them all  come  jim  tip us the stave      jim cleared his throat and obeyed his chief     the quaker s meeting    i       a traveller wended the wilds among     with a purse of gold and a silver tongue     his hat it was broad  and all drab were his clothes     for he hated high colours  except on his nose     and he met with a lady  the story goes       heigho   yea  thee and  nay  thee     ii       the damsel she cast him a merry blink     and the traveller nothing was loth  i think     her merry black eye beamed her bonnet beneath     and the quaker  he grinned  for he d very good teeth     and he asked   art thee     going to ride on the heath        heigho   yea  thee and  nay  thee         footnote  the inferior class of quakers make thee serve not only its  own grammatical use  but also do the duty of thy and thine      iii        i hope you ll protect me  kind sir   said the maid      as to ride this heath over i m sadly afraid     for robbers  they say  here in numbers abound     and i wouldn t  for anything  i should be found     for  between you and me  i have five hundred pound        heigho   yea  thee and  nay  thee     iv        if that is thee own  dear   the quaker he said      i ne er saw a maiden i sooner would wed     and i have another five hundred just now     in the padding that s under my saddle bow     and i ll settle it all upon thee  i vow        heigho   yea  thee and  nay  thee     v       the maiden she smiled  and her rein she drew      your offer i ll take  though i ll not take you      a pistol she held at the quaker s head       now give me your gold  or i ll give you my lead      tis under the saddle i think you said          heigho   yea  thee and  nay  thee     vi       the damsel she ripp d up the saddle bow     and the quaker was never a quaker till now     and he saw by the fair one he wish d for a bride    his purse borne away with a swaggering stride     and the eye that looked tender now only defied         heigho   yea  thee and  nay  thee     vii        the spirit doth move me  friend broadbrim   quoth she      to take all this filthy temptation from thee     for mammon deceiveth  and beauty is fleeting     accept from thy  maai d n  a right loving greeting     for much doth she profit by this quaker s meeting         heigho   yea  thee and  nay  thee     viii        and hark  jolly quaker  so rosy and sly     have righteousness more than a wench in thine eye     don t go again peeping girls  bonnets beneath     remember the one that you met on the heath      her  name s  jimmy  barlow  i tell to your teeth          heigho   yea  thee and  nay  thee     ix         friend  james   quoth the quaker   pray listen to me     for thou canst confer a great favour  d  ye see     the gold thou hast taken is not mine  my friend     but my master s  and on thee i depend    to make it appear i my trust did defend         heigho   yea  thee and  nay  thee     x        so fire a few shots through my clothes  here and there     to make it appear  t was a desp rate affair      so jim he popped first through the skirt of his coat     and then through his collar quite close to his throat      now once through my broad brim   quoth ephraim   i vote       heigho   yea  thee and  nay  thee     xi        i have but a brace   said bold jim   and they  re spent     and i won t load again for a make believe rent       then   said ephraim  producing his pistols   just give    my five hundred pounds back  or  as sure as you live     i ll make of your body a riddle or sieve        heigho   yea  thee and  nay  thee     xii       jim barlow was diddled  and though he was game     he saw ephraim s pistol so deadly in aim     that he gave up the gold  and he took to his scrapers     and when the whole story got into the papers     they said that   the thieves were no match for the quakers          heigho   yea  thee and  nay  thee       well  it s a quare thing you should be singin  a song here   said larry  hogan   about jim barlow  and it s not over half a mile out of this very  place he was hanged       indeed   exclaimed all the men at once  looking with great interest at  larry      it s truth i m telling you  he made a very bowld robbery up by the long  hill there  on  two  gintlemen  for he was mighty stout       pluck to the back bone   said goggins      well  he tuk the purses aff both o  them  and just as he was goin  on  afther doin  the same  what should appear on the road before him  but  two other travellers coming up forninst him  with that the men that was  robbed cried out   stop thief   and so jim  seein  himself hemmed in  betune the four o  them  faced his horse to the ditch and took across  the counthry  but the thravellers was well mounted as well as himself   and powdhered afther him like mad  well  it was equal to a steeple chase  a most  and jim  seein  he could not shake them off  thought the best  thing he could do was to cut out some troublesome work for them  so he  led off where he knew there was the divil s own leap to take  and he  intended to  pound  footnote  impound  them there  and be off in the  mane time  but as ill luck would have it  his own horse  that was as  bowld as himself  and would jump at the moon if he was faced to it   missed his foot in takin  off  and fell short o  the leap and slipped  his shouldher  and jim himself had a bad fall of it too  and  av coorse   it was all over wid him  and up came the four gintlemen  well  jim had  his pistols yet  and he pulled them out  and swore he d shoot the first  man that attempted to take him  but the gintlemen had pistols as well as  he  and were so hot on the chase they determined to have him  and closed  on him  jim fired and killed one o  them  but he got a ball in the  shouldher himself  from another  and he was taken  jim sthruv to shoot  himself with his second pistol  but it missed fire   the curse o  the  road is on me   said jim   my pistol missed fire  and my horse slipped  his shouldher  and now i ll be scragged   says he   but it s not for  nothing  i ve killed one o  ye   says he       he was all pluck   said goggins      desperate bowld   said larry   well  he was thried and condimned  av  coorse   and was hanged  as i tell you  half a mile out o  this very  place  where we are sittin   and his appearance walks  they say  ever  since       you don t say so   said goggins       faith  it s thrue   answered larry      you never saw it   said goggins      the lord forbid   returned larry   but it s thrue  for all that  for  you see the big house near this barn  that is all in ruin  was desarted  because jim s ghost used to walk       that was foolish   said goggins   stir up the fire  jim  and hand me  the whisky       oh  if it was only walkin   they might have got over that  but at last  one night  as the story goes  when there was a thremendious storm o   wind and rain        whisht   said one of the peasants   what s that      as they listened  they heard the beating of heavy rain against the door   and the wind howled through its chinks      well   said goggins   what are you stopping for       oh  i m not stoppin    said larry   i was sayin  that it was a bad wild  night  and jimmy barlow s appearance came into the house and asked them  for a glass o  sper ts  and that he d be obleeged to them if they d  help him with his horse that slipped his shouldher  and   faith  afther   that   they d stay in the place no longer  and signs on it  the house  is gone to rack and ruin  and it s only this barn that is kept up at  all  because it s convaynient for owld skinflint on the farm       that s all nonsense   said goggins  who wished  nevertheless  that he  had not heard the  nonsense       come  sing another song  jim      jim said he did not remember one      then you sing  ralph      ralph said every one knew he never did more than join a chorus      then join me in a chorus   said goggins   for i ll sing  if jim s  afraid       i m not afraid   said jim      then why won t you sing       because i don t like       ah   exclaimed goggins      well  maybe you re afraid yourself   said jim   if you towld thruth     just to show you how little i m afeard   said goggins  with a  swaggering air   i ll sing another song about jimmy barlow       you d better not   said larry hogan   let him rest in pace       fudge   said goggins   will you join chorus  jim       i will   said jim  fiercely      we ll all join   said the men  except larry   who felt it would be a  sort of relief to bully away the supernatural terror which hung round  their hearts after the ghost story by the sound of their own voices      then here goes   said goggins  who started another long ballad about  jimmy barlow  in the opening of which all joined  it ran as follows          my name it is jimmy barlow     i was born in the town of carlow     and here i lie in the maryborough jail     all for the robbing of the wicklow mail       fol de rol de rol de riddle ido      as it would be tiresome to follow this ballad through all its length   breadth  and thickness  we shall leave the singers engaged in their  chorus  while we call the reader s attention to a more interesting  person than mister goggins or jimmy barlow           chapter xxxvii      when edward o connor had hurried from the burial place  he threw himself  into his saddle  and urged his horse to speed  anxious to fly the spot  where his feelings had been so harrowed  and as he swept along through  the cold night wind which began to rise in gusty fits  and howled past  him  there was in the violence of his rapid motion something congenial  to the fierce career of painful thoughts which chased each other through  his heated brain  he continued to travel at this rapid pace  so absorbed  in bitter reflection as to be quite insensible to external impressions   and he knew not how far nor how fast he was going  though the heavy  breathing of his horse at any other time would have been signal  sufficient to draw the rein  but still he pressed onward  and still the  storm increased  and each acclivity was topped but to sweep down the  succeeding slope at the same desperate pace  hitherto the road over  which he pursued his fleet career lay through an open country  and  though the shades of a stormy night hung above it  the horse could make  his way in safety through the gloom  but now they approached an old road  which skirted an ancient domain  whose venerable trees threw their arms  across the old causeway  and added their shadows to the darkness of the  night     many and many a time had edward ridden in the soft summer under the  green shade of these very trees  in company with fanny dawson  his  guiltless heart full of hope and love  perhaps it was this very thought  crossing his mind at the moment which made his present circumstances the  more oppressive  he was guiltless no longer  he rode not in happiness  with the woman he adored under the soft shade of summer trees  but heard  the wintry wind howl through their leafless boughs as he hurried in  maddened speed beneath them  and heard in the dismal sound but an  echo of the voice of remorse which was ringing through his heart  the  darkness was intense from the canopy of old oaks which overhung the  road  but still the horse was urged through the dark ravine at speed   though one might not see an arm s length before  fearlessly it was  performed  though ever and anon  as the trees swung about their heavy  branches in the storm  smaller portions of the boughs were snapped off  and flung in the faces of the horse and the rider  who still spurred  and plashed his headlong way through the heavy road beneath  emerging  at length from the deep and overshadowed valley  a steep hill raised  its crest in advance  but still up the stony acclivity the feet of the  mettled steed rattled rapidly  and flashed fire from the flinty path  as  they approached the top of the hill  the force of the storm became more  apparent  and on reaching its crest  the fierce pelting of the mingled  rain and hail made the horse impatient of the storm of which his rider  was heedless  almost unconscious  the spent animal with short snortings  betokened his labour  and shook his head passionately as the fierce  hail shower struck him in the eyes and nostrils  still  however  was he  urged downward  but he was no longer safe  quite blown  and pressed  over a rough descent  the generous creature  that would die rather than  refuse  made a false step  and came heavily to the ground  edward was  stunned by the fall  though not seriously hurt  and  after the lapse of  a few seconds  recovered his feet  but found the horse still prostrate   taking the animal by the head  he assisted him to rise  which he was not  enabled to do till after several efforts  and when he regained his legs   it was manifest he was seriously lamed  and as he limped along with  difficulty beside his master  who led him gently  it became evident that  it was beyond the animal s power to reach his own stable that night   edward for the first time was now aware of how much he had punished his  horse  he felt ashamed of using the noble brute with such severity  and  became conscious that he had been acting under something little short  of frenzy  the consciousness at once tended to restore him somewhat to  himself  and he began to look around on every side in search of some  house where he could find rest and shelter for his disabled horse  as  he proceeded thus  the care necessarily bestowed on his dumb companion  partially called off his thoughts from the painful theme with which they  had been exclusively occupied  and the effect was most beneficial  the  first violent burst of feeling was past  and a calmer train of thought  succeeded  he for the first time remembered the boy had forgiven him   and that was a great consolation to him  he recalled  too  his own  words  pledging to gustavus his friendship  and in this pleasing hope of  the future he saw much to redeem what he regretted of the past  still   however  the wild flare of the pine torch over the lone grave of his  adversary  and the horrid answer of the grave digger  that he was but   finishing  his  work   would recur to his memory and awake an internal  pang     from this painful reminiscence he sought to escape  by looking forward  to all he would do for gustavus  and had become much calmer  when the  glimmer of a light not far ahead attracted him  and he soon was enabled  to perceive it proceeded from some buildings that lay on his right   not far from the road  he turned up the rough path which formed the  approach  and the light escaped through the chinks of a large door which  indicated the place to be a coach house  or some such office  belonging  to the general pile which seemed in a ruinous condition     as he approached  edward heard rude sounds of merriment  amongst which  the joining of many voices in a  ree raw  chorus indicated that a  carouse was going forward within     on reaching the door he could perceive through a wide chink a group  of men sitting round a turf fire piled at the far end of the building   which had no fire place  and the smoke  curling upwards to the roof   wreathed the rafters in smoke  beneath this vapoury canopy the party  sat drinking and singing  and edward  ere he knocked for admittance   listened to the following strange refrain           for my name it is jimmy barlow     i was born in the town of carlow     and here i lie in maryborough jail     all for the robbing of the wicklow mail                    fol de rol de riddle iddle ido       then the principal singer took up the song  which seemed to be one of  robbery  blood  and murder  for it ran thus          then he cocked his pistol gaily     and stood before him bravely     smoke and fire is my desire     so blaze away  my game cock squire           for my name it is jimmy barlow          i was born  c       edward o connor knocked at the door loudly  the words he had just heard  about  pistols    blazing away   and  last of all    squire   fell  gratingly on his ear at that moment  and seemed strangely to connect  themselves with the previous adventures of the night and his own sad  thoughts  and he beat against the door with violence     the chorus ceased  edward repeated his knocking  still there was no  answer  but he heard low and hurried muttering inside  determined   however  to gain admittance  edward laid hold of an iron hasp outside  the door  which enabled him to shake the gate with violence  that there  might be no excuse on the part of the inmates that they did not hear   but in thus making the old door rattle in its frame  it suddenly yielded  to his touch and creaked open on its rusty hinges  for when larry hogan  had entered  it had been forgotten to be barred     as edward stood in the open doorway  the first object which met his eye  was the coffin  and it is impossible to say how much at that moment the  sight shocked him  he shuddered involuntarily  yet could not withdraw  his eyes from the revolting object  and the pallor with which his  previous mental anxiety had invested his cheek increased as he looked on  this last tenement of mortality   am i to see nothing but the evidences  of death s doing this night   was the mental question which shot through  edward s over wrought brain  and he grew livid at the thought  he looked  more like one raised from the grave than a living being  and a wild  glare in his eyes rendered his appearance still more unearthly  he felt  that shame which men always experience in allowing their feelings to  overcome them  and by a great effort he mastered his emotion and spoke   but the voice partook of the strong nervous excitement under which he  laboured  and was hollow and broken  and seemed more like that which one  might fancy to proceed from the jaws of a sepulchre than one of flesh  and blood  beaten by the storm  too  his hair hung in wet flakes over  his face and added to his wild appearance  so that the men all started  up at the first glimpse they caught of him  and huddled themselves  together in the farthest corner of the building  from whence they eyed  him with evident alarm     edward thought some whisky might check the feeling of faintness which  overcame him  and though he deemed it probable he had broken in upon the  nocturnal revel of desperate and lawless men  he nevertheless asked them  to give him some  but instead of displaying that alacrity so universal  in ireland  of sharing the  creature  with a new comer  the men only  pointed to the bottle which stood beside the fire  and drew closer  together     edward s desire for the stimulant was so great  that he scarcely noticed  the singular want of courtesy on the part of the men  and seizing the  bottle  for there was no glass   he put it to his lips  and quaffed a  hearty dram of the spirit before he spoke      i must ask for shelter and assistance here   said edward   my horse  i  fear  has slipped his shoulder       before he could utter another word  a simultaneous roar of terror burst  from the group  they fancied the ghost of jimmy barlow was before them   and made a simultaneous rush from the barn  and when they saw the horse  at the door  another yell escaped them  as they fled with increased  speed and terror  edward stood in amazement as the men rushed from his  presence  he followed to the gate to recall them  they were gone  he  could only hear their yells in the distance  the circumstance seemed  quite unaccountable  and as he stood lost in vain surmises as to the  cause of the strange occurrence  a low neigh of recognition from the  horse reminded him of the animal s wants  and he led him into the barn   where  from the plenty of straw which lay around  he shook down a litter  where the maimed animal might rest     he then paced up and down the barn  lost in wonder at the conduct  of those whom he found there  and whom his presence had so suddenly  expelled  and ever as he walked towards the fire  the coffin caught his  eye  as a fitful blaze occasionally arose  it flashed upon the plate   which brightly reflected the flame  and edward was irresistibly drawn   despite his original impression of horror at the object  to approach and  read the inscription  the shield bore the name of  o grady   and edward  recoiled from the coffin with a shudder  and inwardly asked  was he in  his waking senses  he had but an hour ago seen his adversary laid in his  grave  yet here was his coffin again before him  as if to harrow up his  soul anew  was it real  or a mockery  was he the sport of a dream  or  was there some dreadful curse fallen upon him that he should be for ever  haunted by the victim of his arm  and the call of vengeance for blood  be ever upon his track  he breathed short and hard  and the smoky  atmosphere in which he was enveloped rendered respiration still more  difficult  as through this oppressive vapour  which seemed only fit  for the nether world  he saw the coffin plate flash back the flame  his  imagination accumulated horror on horror  and when the blaze sank  and  but the bright red of the fire was reflected  it seemed to him to burn   as it were  with a spot of blood  and he could support the scene no  longer  but rushed from the barn in a state of mind bordering on frenzy     it was about an hour afterwards  near midnight  that the old barn was in  flames  most likely some of the straw near the fire  in the confusion  of the breaking up of the party  had been scattered within range of  ignition  and caused the accident  the flames were seen for miles round  the country  and the shattered walls of the ruined mansion house were  illuminated brightly by the glare of the consuming barn  which in the  morning added its own blackened and reeking ruin to the desolation   and crowds of persons congregated to the spot for many days after  the  charred planks of the coffin were dragged from amongst the ruin  and  as the roof in falling in had dragged a large portion of the wall  along with it  the stones which had filled the coffin could not be  distinguished from those of the fallen building  therefore much wonder  arose that no vestige of the bones of the corpse it was supposed to  contain should be discovered  wonder increased to horror as the strange  fact was promulgated  and in the ready credulity of a superstitious  people  the terrible belief became general  that his sable majesty had  made off with o grady and the party watching him  for as the dublin  bailiffs never stopped till they got back to town  and were never seen  again in the country  it was most natural to suppose that the devil had  made a haul of  them  at the same time  in a few days rumour added the  spectral appearance of jim barlow to the tale  which only deepened  its mysterious horror  and though  after some time  the true story was  promulgated by those who knew the real state of the case  yet the truth  never gained ground  and was considered but a clever sham  attempted by  the family to prevent so dreadful a story from attaching to their house   and tradition perpetuates to this hour the belief that  the devil flew  away with o grady      lone and shunned as the hill was where the ruined house stood  it became  more lone and shunned than ever  and the boldest heart in the whole  country side would quail to be in its vicinity  even in the day time  to  such a pitch the panic rose  that an extensive farm which encircled  it  and belonged to the old usurer who made the seizure  fell into a  profitless state from the impossibility of men being found to work upon  it  it was useless even as pasture  for no one could be found to herd  cattle upon it  altogether it was a serious loss to the money grubber   and so far the incident of the burnt barn  and the tradition it gave  rise to  acted beneficially in making the inhuman act of warring with  the dead recoil upon the merciless old usurer           chapter xxxviii      we left andy in what may be called a delicate situation  and though  andy s perceptions of the refined were not very acute  he himself began  to wonder how he should get out of the dilemma into which circumstances  had thrown him  and even to his dull comprehension various terminations  to his adventure suggested themselves  till he became quite confused in  the chaos which his own thoughts created  one good idea  however  andy  contrived to lay hold of out of the bundle which perplexed him  he felt  that to gain time would be an advantage  and if evil must come of his  adventure  the longer he could keep it off the better  so he kept up his  affectation of timidity  and put in his sobs and lamentations  like so  many commas and colons  as it were  to prevent bridget from arriving at  her climax of going to bed     bridget insisted bed was the finest thing in the world for a young woman  in distress of mind     andy protested he never could get a wink of sleep when his mind was  uneasy  bridget promised the most sisterly tenderness     andy answered by a lament for his mother      come to bed  i tell you   said bridget      are the sheets aired   sobbed andy      what   exclaimed bridget  in amazement      if you are not sure of the sheets bein  aired   said andy   i d be  afeard of catchin  cowld       sheets  indeed   said bridget    faith  it s a dainty lady you are  if  you can t sleep without sheets       what   returned andy   no sheets       divil a sheet       oh  mother  mother   exclaimed andy   what would you say to your  innocent child being tuk away to a place where there was no sheets       well  i never heerd the like   says bridget      oh  the villains  to bring me where i wouldn t have a bit o  clane  linen to lie in       sure  there s blankets  i tell you       oh  don t talk to me   roared andy   sure  you know  sheets is only  dacent       bother  girl  isn t a snug woolly blanket a fine thing       oh  don t brake my heart that a way   sobbed andy   sure  there s wool  on any dirty sheep s back  but linen is dacency  oh  mother  mother  if  you thought your poor girl was without a sheet this night      and so andy went on  spinning his bit of  linen manufacture  as long as  he could  and raising bridget s wonder that  instead of the lament which  abducted ladies generally raise about their  vartue   this young woman s  principal complaint arose on the scarcity of flax  bridget appealed  to common sense if blankets were not good enough in these bad times   insisting  moreover  that  as  love was warmer than friendship  so wool  was warmer than flax   the beauty of which parallel case nevertheless  failed to reconcile the disconsolate abducted  now andy had pushed his  plea of the want of linen as far as he thought it would go  and when  bridget returned to the charge  and reiterated the oft repeated  come  to bed  i tell you   andy had recourse to twiddling about his toes  and  chattering his teeth  and exclaimed in a tremulous voice   oh  i ve a  thrimblin  all over me       loosen the sthrings o  you  then   said bridget  about to suit  the action to the word   ow  ow   cried andy   don t touch me  i m  ticklish       then open the throat o  your gown yourself  dear   said bridget      i ve a cowld on my chest  and darn t   said andy   but i think a dhrop  of hot punch would do me good if i had it       and plenty of it   said bridget   if that ll plaze you   she rose as  she spoke  and set about getting  the materials  for making punch     andy hoped  by means of this last idea  to drink bridget into a state of  unconsciousness  and then make his escape  but he had no notion  until  he tried  what a capacity the gentle bridget had for carrying tumblers  of punch steadily  he proceeded as cunningly as possible  and  on the  score of  the thrimblin  over him   repeated the doses of punch  which   nevertheless  he protested he couldn t touch  unless bridget kept him in  countenance  glass for glass  and bridget  genial soul  was no way both   for living in a still  and among smugglers  as she did  it was not  a trifle of stingo could bring her to a halt  andy  even with the  advantage of the stronger organisation of a man  found this mountain  lass nearly a match for him  and before the potations operated as  he hoped upon her  his own senses began to feel the influence of the  liquor  and his caution became considerably undermined     still  however  he resisted the repeated offers of the couch proposed to  him  declaring he would sleep in his clothes  and leave to bridget the  full possession of her lair     the fire began to burn low  and andy thought he might facilitate his  escape by counterfeiting sleep  so feigning slumber as well as he could   he seemed to sink into insensibility  and bridget unrobed herself and  retired behind a rough screen     it was by a great effort that andy kept himself awake  for his  potations  added to his nocturnal excursion  tended towards somnolency   but the desire of escape  and fear of a discovery and its consequences   prevailed over the ordinary tendency of nature  and he remained awake   watching every sound  the silence at last became painful  so still was  it  that he could hear the small crumbling sound of the dying embers  as they decomposed and shifted their position on the hearth  and yet he  could not be satisfied from the breathing of the woman that she slept   after the lapse of half an hour  however  he ventured to make some  movement  he had well observed the quarter in which the outlet from the  cave lay  and there was still a faint glimmer from the fire to assist  him in crawling towards the trap  it was a relief when  after some  minutes of cautious creeping  he felt the fresh air breathing from  above  and a moment or two more brought him in contact with the ladder   with the stealth of a cat he began to climb the rungs  he could hear the  men snoring on the outside of the cave  step by step as he arose he  felt his heart beat faster at the thought of escape  and became more  cautious  at length his head emerged from the cave  and he saw the men  lying about its mouth  they lay close around it  he must step over them  to escape  the chance is fearful  but he determines to attempt it  he  ascends still higher  his foot is on the last rung of the ladder  the  next step puts him on the heather  when he feels a hand lay hold of him  from below     his heart died within him at the touch  and he could not resist an  exclamation      who s that   exclaimed one of the men outside  andy crouched      come down   said the voice softly from below   if jack sees you  it  will be worse for you      it was the voice of bridget  and andy felt it was better to be with  her than exposed to the savagery of shan more and his myrmidons  so he  descended quietly  and gave himself up to the tight hold of bridget   who  with many asseverations that  out of her arms she would not let the  prisoner go till morning   led him back to the cave           chapter xxxix         great wit to madness nearly is allied     and thin partitions do the bounds divide      so sings the poet  but whether the wit be great or little  the  thin  partition  separating madness from sanity is equally mysterious  it is  true that the excitability attendant upon genius approximates so closely  to madness  that it is sometimes difficult to distinguish between them   but  without the attendant  genius  to hold up the train of madness   and call for our special permission and respect in any of its fantastic  excursions  the most ordinary crack brain sometimes chooses to sport in  the regions of sanity  and  without the license which genius is supposed  to dispense to her children  poach over the preserves of common sense   this is a well known fact  and would not be reiterated here  but that  the circumstances about to be recorded hereafter might seem unworthy  of belief  and as the veracity of our history we would not have for one  moment questioned  we have ventured to jog the memory of our readers as  to the close neighbourhood of madness and common sense  before we record  a curious instance of intermitting madness in the old dowager o grady     her son s death had  by the violence of the shock  dragged her from the  region of fiction in which she habitually existed  but after the funeral  she relapsed into all her strange aberration  and her bird clock and her  chimney pot head dress were once more in requisition     the old lady had her usual attendance from her granddaughter  and the  customary offering of flowers was rendered  but they were not so cared  for as before  and charlotte was dismissed sooner than usual from her  morning s attendance  and a new favourite received in her place  and   of all the birds in the air   who should this favourite be but master  ratty  yes   ratty  the caricaturist of his grandmamma  was   for the  nonce   her closeted companion  many a guess was given as to  what in  the world  grandmamma  could  want with ratty  but the secret was kept  between them  for this reason  that the old lady kept  the reward she  promised  ratty for preserving it in her own hands  until the duty she  required on his part should be accomplished  and the shilling a day to  which ratty looked forward kept him faithful     now the duty master ratty had to perform was instructing his grandmamma  how to handle a pistol  the bringing up quick to the mark  and levelling  by  the sight   was explained  but a difficulty arose in the old lady s  shutting her left eye  which ratty declared to be indispensable  and  for some time ratty was obliged to stand on a chair and cover his  grandmamma s eye with his hand while she took aim  this was found  inconvenient  however  and the old lady substituted a black silk shade  to obfuscate her sinister luminary in her exercises  which now advanced  to snapping the lock  and knocking sparks from the flint  which made the  old lady wink with her right eye  when this second habit was overcome   the  dry  practice  that is  without powder  was given up  and a   flash in the pan  was ventured upon  but this made her shut both eyes  together  and it was some time before she could prevail on herself to  hold her eye fixed on her mark  and pull the trigger  this  however  at  last was accomplished  and when she had conquered the fear of seeing the  flash  she adopted the plan of standing before a handsome old fashioned  looking glass which reached from the ceiling to the floor  and levelling  the pistol at her own reflection within it  as if she were engaged in  mortal combat  and every time she snapped and burned priming she  would exclaim   i hit him that time   i know i can kill him   tremble   villain       as long as this pistol practice had the charm of novelty for ratty   it was all very well  but when  day by day  the strange mistakes and  nervousness of his grandmamma became less piquant from repetition  it  was not such good fun  and when the rantipole boy  after as much time  as he wished to devote to the old woman s caprice  endeavoured to  emancipate himself and was countermanded  an outburst of   oh  bother     would take place  till the grandmother called up the prospective  shillings to his view  and ratty bowed before the altar of mammon  but  even mammon failed to keep ratty loyal  for that heathen god  momus   claimed a superior allegiance  ratty worshipped the  cap and bells  as  the true crown  and  the bauble  as the sovereign sceptre  besides  the  secret became troublesome to him  and he determined to let the whole  house know what  gran  and he were about  in a way of his own     the young imp  in the next day s practice  worked up the grandmamma to a  state of great excitement  urging her to take a cool and determined aim  at the looking glass   cover him well  gran   said ratty      i will   said the dowager  resolutely      you ought to be able to hit him at six paces       i stand at twelve paces       no  you are only six from the looking glass       but the reflection  child  in the mirror  doubles the distance       bother   said ratty   here  take the pistol  mind your eye and don t  wink       ratty  you are singularly obtuse to the charms of science       what s science   said ratty      science  child  is knowledge of a lofty and abstruse nature  developing  itself in wonderful inventions  gunpowder  for instance  is made by  science       indeed it is not   said ratty   i never saw his name on a canister   pigou  andrew  and wilks  or mister dartford mills  are the men for  gunpowder  you know nothing about it  gran       ratty  you are disrespectful  and will not listen to instruction  i  knew kirwan  the great kirwan  the chemist  who always wore his hat        then he knew chemistry better than manners       ratty  you are very troublesome  i desire you listen  sir  kirwan  sir   told me all about science  and the dublin society have his picture  with  a bottle in his hand        then he was fond of drink   said ratty      ratty  don t be pert  to come back to what i was originally saying  i  repeat  sir  i am at twelve paces from my object  six from the mirror   which  doubled by reflection  makes twelve  such is the law of optics  i  suppose you know what optics are       to be sure i do       tell me  then       our eyes   said ratty      eyes   exclaimed the old lady  in amaze      to be sure   answered ratty  boldly   didn t i hear the old blind man  at the fair asking charity  for the loss of his blessed optics        oh  what lamentable ignorance  my child   exclaimed the old lady   your  tutor ought to be ashamed of himself       so he is   said ratty   he hasn t had a pair of new breeches for the  last seven years  and he hides himself whenever he sees mamma or the  girls       oh  you ignorant child  indeed  ratty  my love  you must study  i will  give you the renowned kirwan s book  charlotte tore some of it for curl  papers  but there s enough left to enlighten you with the sun s rays   and reflection and refraction        i know what  that  is   said ratty      what       refraction       and what is it  dear       bad behaviour   said ratty      oh  heavens   exclaimed his grandmother      yes  it is   said ratty  stoutly   the tutor says i m refractory when i  behave ill  and he knows latin better than you       ratty  ratty  you are hopeless   exclaimed his grandmamma      no  i am not   said ratty   i m always  hoping   and i hope uncle  robert will break his neck some day  and leave us his money      the old woman turned up her eyes  and exclaimed   you wicked boy       fudge   said ratty   he s an old shaver  and we want it  and indeed   gran  you ought to give me ten shillings for ten days  teaching  now   and there s a fair next week  and i want to buy things       ratty  i told you when you made me perfect in the use of my weapon i  would pay you  my promise is sacred  and i will observe it with that  scrupulous honour which has ever been the characteristic of the family   as soon as i hit something  and satisfy myself of my mastery over the  weapon  the money shall be yours  but not till then       oh  very well   said ratty   go on then   ready   don t bring up your  arm that way  like the handle of a pump  but raise it nice from the  elbow  that s it   ready  fire   ah  there you blink your eye  and drop  the point of your pistol  try another   ready  fire   that s better  now  steady the next time       illustration  a crack shot     the young villain then put a charge of powder and ball into the pistol  he handed his grandmother  who took steady aim at her reflection in the  mirror  and at the words    ready  fire    bang went the pistol  the  magnificent glass was smashed  the unexpected recoil of the weapon made  it drop from the hand of the dowager  who screamed with astonishment at  the report and the shock  and did not see for a moment the mischief she  had done  but when the shattered mirror caught her eyes  she made a rush  at ratty  who was screeching with laughter in the far corner of the room  where he ran to when he had achieved his trick  and he was so helpless  from the excess of his cachinnation  that the old lady cuffed him  without his being able to defend himself  at last he contrived to get  out of her clutches and jammed her against the wall with a table so  tightly  that she roared  murder   the report of the pistol ringing  through the house brought all its inmates to the spot  and there  the cries of murder from the old lady led them to suppose some awful  tragedy  instead of a comedy  was enacting inside  the door was locked   too  which increased the alarm  and was forced in the moment of terror  from the outside  when the crowd rushed in  master ratty rushed out  and  left the astonished family to gather up the bits of the story  as well  as they could  from the broken looking glass and the cracked dowager           chapter xl      though it is clear the serious events in the o grady family had not  altered master ratty s propensities in the least  the case was far  different with gustavus  in that one night of suffering which  he  had  passed  the gulf was leaped that divides the boy from the man  and the  extra frivolity and carelessness which clung from boyhood up to the age  of fifteen was at once  by the sudden disrupture produced by events   thrown off  and as singular a ripening into manhood commenced     gustavus was of a generous nature  and even his faults belonged less  to his organisation than to the devil may care sort of education he  received  if education it might be called  upon his generosity the  conduct of edward o connor beside the grave of the boy s father had  worked strongly  and though gustavus could not give his hand beside the  grave to the man with whom his father had engaged in deadly quarrel  yet  he quite exonerated edward from any blame  and when  after a night more  sleepless than gustavus had ever known  he rose early on the ensuing  morning  he determined to ride over to edward o connor s house to  breakfast  and commence that friendship which edward had so solemnly  promised to him  and with which the boy was pleased  for gustavus was  quite aware in what estimation edward was held  and though the relative  circumstances in which he and the late squire stood prevented the boy  from  caring a fig  for him  as he often said himself  yet he was  not beyond the influence of that thing called  reputation   which so  powerfully attaches to and elevates the man who wins it  and the price  at which edward was held in the country influenced opinion even in  neck or nothing hall  albeit though  against the grain   gustavus had  sometimes heard  from the lips of the idle and ignorant  edward sneered  at for being  cruel wise   and  too much of a schoolmaster   and fit for  nothing but books or a boudoir  and called a  piano man   with all the  rest of the hackneyed dirt which jealous inferiority loves to fling at  the heights it cannot occupy  for though  as it has been said  edward   from his manly and sensible bearing  had escaped such sneers better than  most men  still some few there were to whom his merit was offensive   gustavus  however  though he sometimes heard such things  saw with his  own eyes that edward could back a horse with any man in the country  was  always foremost in the chace  could bring down as many brace of birds as  most men in a day  had saved one or two persons from drowning  and if he  did all these things as well as other men  gustavus  though hitherto too  idle to learn much himself  did not see why a man should be sneered  at for being an accomplished scholar as well  therefore he had good  foundation for being pleased at the proffered friendship of such a man   and remembering the poignancy of edward s anguish on the foregoing eve   gustavus generously resolved to see him at once and offer him the  hand which a nice sense of feeling made him withhold the night before   mounting his pony  an hour s smart riding brought him to mount eskar   for such was the name of mr  o connor s residence     it was breakfast time when gustavus arrived  but edward had not yet left  his room  and the servant went to call him  it need scarcely be said  that edward had passed a wretched night  reaching home  as he did  weary  in mind and body  and with feelings and imagination both overwrought  it  was long before he could sleep  and even then his slumber was disturbed  by harassing visions and frightful images  spectral shapes and things  unimaginable to the waking senses danced and crawled and hissed about  him  the torch flared above the grave  and that horrid coffin  with the  name of the dead o grady upon it   murdered sleep   it was dawn before  anything like refreshing slumber touched his feverish eyelids  and he  had not enjoyed more than a couple of hours of what might be called  sleep  when the servant called him  and then  after the brief oblivion  he had obtained  one may fancy how he started when the first words he  heard on waking were   mister o grady is below  sir      edward started up from his bed and stared wildly on the man  as he  exclaimed  with a look of alarm   o grady  for god s sake  you don t say  o grady        tis master gustavus  sir   said the man  wondering at the wildness of  edward s manner      oh  the boy   ay  ay  the boy   repeated edward  drawing his hands  across his eyes and recovering his self possession   say i will be down  presently      the man retired  and edward lay down again for some minutes to calm the  heavy beating of his heart which the sudden mention of that name had  produced  that name so linked with the mental agony of the past night   that name which had conjured up a waking horror of such might as to  shake the sway of reason for a time  and which afterwards pursued its  reign of terror through his sleep  after such a night  fancy poor edward  doomed to hear the name of o grady again the first thing in the morning   and we cannot wonder that he was startled     a few minutes  however  served to restore his self possession  and he  arose  made his toilet in haste  and descended to the breakfast parlour   where he was met by gustavus with an open hand  which edward clasped  with fervour and held for some time as he looked on the handsome face  of the boy  and saw in its frank expression all that his heart could  desire  they spoke not a word  but they understood one another  and that  moment commenced an attachment which increased with increasing intimacy   and became one of those steadfast friendships which are seldom met with     after breakfast edward brought gustavus to his  den   as he called a  room which was appropriated to his own particular use  occupied with  books and a small collection of national relics  some long ranges of  that peculiar calf binding  with its red label  declared at once the  contents to be law and by the dry formal cut of the exterior gave little  invitation to reading  the very outside of a law library is repulsive   the continuity of that eternal buff leather gives one a surfeit by  anticipation  and makes one mentally exclaim in despair   heavens  how  can any one hope to get all that into his head   the only plain honest  thing about law is the outside of the books where it is laid down  there  all is simple  inside all is complex  the interlacing lines of the  binder s patterns find no place on the covers  but intricacies abound  inside  where any line is easier found than a straight one  nor gold  leaf nor tool is employed without  but within how many fallacies are  enveloped in glozing words  the gold leaf has its representative in   legal fiction   and as for   tooling   there s plenty of that     other books  also  bore external evidence of the nature of their  contents  some old parchment covers indicated the lore of past ages   amidst these the brightest names of greece and rome were to be found   as well as those who have adorned our own literature  and implied  a cultivated taste on the part of the owner  but one portion of the  library was particularly well stored  the works bearing on irish history  were numerous  and this might well account for the ardour of edward s  feelings in the cause of his country  for it is as impossible that a  river should run backwards to its source  as that any irishman of a  generous nature can become acquainted with the real history of his  country  and not feel that she has been an ill used and neglected land   and not struggle in the cause of her being righted  much  has  been done  in the cause since the days of which this story treats  and edward was  amongst those who helped to achieve it  but much has still to be done   and there is glorious work in store for present and future edward  o connors     along with the books which spoke the cause of ireland  the mute  evidences  also  of her former glory and civilisation were scattered  through the room  various ornaments of elegant form  and wrought in the  purest gold  were tastefully arranged over the mantel piece  some  from  their form  indicating their use  and others only affording matter of  ingenious speculation to the antiquary  but all bearing evidence of  early civilisation  the frontlet of gold indicated noble estate  and  the long and tapering bodkin of the same metal  with its richly enchased  knob or pendent crescent  implied the robe it once fastened could have  been of no mean texture  and the wearer of no mean rank  weapons were  there  too  of elegant form and exquisite workmanship  wrought in that  ancient bronze  of such wondrous temper that it carries effective edge  and point  the sword was of exact phoenician mould  the double eyed  spear head  formed at once for strength and lightness  might have served  as the model for a sculptor in arming the hand of minerva  could these  be the work of an uncultivated people  impossible  the harp  too  was  there  that unfailing mark of polish and social elegance  the bard and  barbarism could never be coeval  but a relic was there  exciting still  deeper interest  an ancient crosier  of curious workmanship  wrought  in the precious metals and partly studded with jewels  but few of the  latter remained  though the empty collets showed it had once been costly  in such ornaments  could this be seen without remembering that the light  of christianity first dawned over the western isles  in ireland   that   there  the gospel was first preached   there  the work of salvation  begun     there be cold hearts to which these touching recollections do not  pertain  and they heed them not  and some there are  who  with a  callousness which shocks sensibility  have the ignorant effrontery to  ask   of what use are such recollections   with such frigid utilitarians  it would be vain to argue  but this question  at least  may be put in  return   why should the ancient glories of greece and rome form a large  portion of the academic studies of our youth   why should the evidences  of  their  arts and  their  arms be held precious in museums  and  similar evidences of ancient cultivation be despised because they  pertain to another nation  is it because they are irish they are held  in contempt  alas  in many cases it is so  ay  and even  shame to say   within her own shores  but never may that day arrive when ireland shall  be without enough of true and fond hearts to cherish the memory of  her ancient glories  to give to her future sons the evidences of her  earliest western civilisation  proving that their forefathers were not   as those say who wronged and therefore would malign them  a rabble  of rude barbarians  but that brave kings  and proud princes  and wise  lawgivers  and just judges  and gallant chiefs  and chaste and lovely  women were among them  and that inspired bards were there to perpetuate  such memories     gustavus had never before seen a crosier  and asked what it was  on  being informed of its name  he then said   but what  is  a crosier       a bishop s pastoral staff   said edward      and why have you a bishop s staff  and swords  and spears  hung up  together       that is not inappropriate   said edward   unfortunately  the sword and  the crosier have been frequently but too intimate companions  preaching  the word of peace has been too often the pretext for war  the spaniards   for instance  in the name of the gospel  committed the most fearful  atrocities       oh  i know   said gustavus   that was in the time of bloody mary and  the armada      edward wondered at the boy s ignorance  and saw in an instant the source  of his false application of his allusion to the spaniards  gustavus had  been taught to vaguely couple the name of  bloody mary  with everything  bad  and that of  good queen bess  with all that was glorious  and the  word  spanish   in poor gusty s head  had been hitherto connected with  two ideas  namely   liquorice  and the  armada      edward  without wounding the sensitive shame of ignorant youth  gently  set him right  and made him aware he had alluded to the conduct of the  spaniards in america under cortes and pizarro     for the first time in his life gustavus was aware that pizarro was a  real character  he had heard his grandmamma speak of a play of that  name  and how great mr  kemble was in rollo  and how he saved a child   but as to its belonging to history  it was a new light  the utmost gusty  knew about america being that it was discovered by columbus      but the crosier   said edward   is amongst the most interesting of  irish antiquities  and especially belongs to an irish collection  when  you remember the earliest preaching of christianity in the western isles  was in ireland       i did only know that   said the boy      then you don t know why the shamrock is our national emblem       no   said gustavus   though i take care to mount one in my hat every  patrick s day       well   said edward  anxious to give gustavus credit for  any  knowledge  he possessed   you know at least it is connected with the memory of st   patrick  though you don t know why  i will tell you  when st  patrick  first preached the christian faith in ireland  before a powerful chief  and his people  when he spoke of one god  and of the trinity  the chief  asked how one could be in three  st  patrick  instead of attempting a  theological definition of the faith  thought a simple image would best  serve to enlighten a simple people  and stooping to the earth he plucked  from the green sod a shamrock  and holding up the trefoil before them  he bade them there behold one in three  the chief  struck by the  illustration  asked at once to be baptised  and all his sept followed  his example       i never heard that before   said gusty    t is very beautiful       i will tell you something else connected with it   said edward      after baptising the chief  st  patrick made an eloquent exhortation  to the assembled multitude  and in the course of his address  while  enforcing his urgent appeal with appropriate gesture  as the hand which  held his crosier  after being raised towards heaven  descended again  towards the earth  the point of his staff  armed with metal  was  driven through the foot of the chief  who  fancying it was part of the  ceremony  and but a necessary testing of the firmness of his faith   never winced       he was a fine fellow   said gusty   and is that the crosier   he added   alluding to the one in edward s collection  and manifestly excited by  what he had heard      no   said edward   but one of early date  and belonging to some of the  first preachers of the gospel amongst us       and have you other things here with such beautiful stories belonging to  them   inquired gusty  eager for more of that romantic lore which youth  loves so passionately      not that i know of   answered edward  but if these objects here had  only tongues  if every sword  and belt  and spear head  and golden  bodkin  and other trinket could speak  no doubt we should hear stirring  stories of gallant warriors and their ladye loves       aye  that would be something to hear   exclaimed gusty      well   said edward   you may have many  such  stories by reading the  history of your country  which if you have not read  i can lend you  books enough       oh  thank you   said gusty   i should like it so much      edward approached the book shelf and selected a volume he thought the  most likely to interest so little practised a reader  and when he turned  round he saw gusty poising in his hand an antique irish sword of bronze      do you know what that is   inquired edward      i can t tell you the name of it   answered gusty   but i suppose it was   something to stick a fellow       edward smiled at the characteristic reply  and told him it was an  antique irish sword      a sword   he exclaimed   isn t it short for a sword       all the swords of that day were short       when was that   inquired the boy      somewhere about two thousand years ago       two thousand years   exclaimed gusty  in surprise   how is it possible  you can tell this is two thousand years old       because it is made of the same metal and of the same shape as the  swords found at cannae  where the carthaginians fought the romans       i know the roman history   said gusty  eager to display his little bit  of knowledge   i know the roman history  romulus and remus were educated  by a wolf   edward could not resist a smile  which he soon suppressed   and continued    such works as you now hold in your hand are found  in  quantities  in ireland  and seldom anywhere else in europe  except in  italy  particularly at cannae  where some thousands of carthaginians  fell  and when we find the sword of the same make and metal in places  so remote  it establishes a strong connecting link between the people of  carthage and of ireland  and at once shows their date       how curious that is   exclaimed gusty   and how odd i never heard it  before  are there many such curious things you know       many   said edward      i wonder how people can find out such odd things   said the boy      my dear boy   said edward   after getting a certain amount of  knowledge  other knowledge comes very fast  it gathers like a  snowball  or perhaps it would be better to illustrate the fact by a  milldam  you know  when the water is low in the milldam  the miller  cannot drive his wheel  but the moment the water comes up to a certain  level it has force to work the mill  and so it is with knowledge  when  once you get it up to a certain level  you can  work your mill   with  this great advantage over the milldam  that the stream of knowledge   once reaching the working level  never runs dry       oh  i wish i knew as much as you do   exclaimed gusty      and so you can if you wish it   said edward     gusty sighed heavily  and admitted he had been very idle  edward told  him he had plenty of time before him to repair the damage     a conversation then ensued  perfectly frank on the part of the boy   and kind on edward s side to all his deficiencies  which he found to  be lamentable  as far as learning went  he had some small smattering of  latin  but gustavus vowed steady attention to his tutor and his studies  for the future  edward  knowing what a miserable scholar the tutor  himself was  offered to put gustavus through his latin and greek  himself  gustavus accepted the offer with gratitude  and rode over  every day to mount eskar for his lesson  and  under the intelligent  explanations of edward  the difficulties which had hitherto discouraged  him disappeared  and it was surprising what progress he made  at the  same time he devoured irish history  and became rapidly tinctured with  that enthusiastic love of all that belonged to his country which he  found in his teacher  and edward soon hailed  in the ardent neophyte   a noble and intelligent spirit redeemed from ignorance and rendered  capable of higher enjoyments than those to be derived merely from  field sports  edward  however  did not confine his instructions to  book learning only  there is much to be learned by living with the  educated  whose current conversation alone is instructive  and edward  had gustavus with him as constantly as he could  and after some time   when the frequency of gusty s visits to mount eskar ceased to excite any  wonder at home  he sometimes spent several days together with edward  to  whom he became continually more and more attached  edward showed great  judgment in making his training attractive to his pupil  he did not  attend merely to his head  he thought of other things as well  joined  him in the sports and exercises he knew  and taught him those in which  he was uninstructed  fencing  for instance  was one of these  edward was  a tolerable master of his foil  and in a few months gustavus  under his  tuition  could parry a thrust and make no bad attempt at a hit himself   his improvement in every way was so remarkable  that it was noticed by  all  and its cause did not long remain secret  and when it  was  known   edward o connor s character stood higher than ever  and the whole  country said it was a lucky day for gusty o grady that he found such  a friend  as the limits of our story would not permit the intercourse  between edward and gustavus to be treated in detail  this general sketch  of it has been given  and in stating its consequences so far  a peep  into the future has been granted by the author  with a benevolence  seldom belonging to his ill natured and crafty tribe  who endeavour to  hoodwink their docile followers as much as possible  and keep them in  a state of ignorance as to coming events  but now  having been so  indulgent  we must beg to lay hold of the skirts of our readers and pull  them back again down the ladder into the private still  where bridget  pulled back andy very much after the same fashion  and the results of  which we must treat of in our next chapter           chapter xli      when bridget dragged andy back and insisted on his going to bed      no  i will not be too good natured and tell my story in that way   besides  it would be a very difficult matter to tell it  and why should  an author  merely to oblige people  get himself involved in a labyrinth  of difficulties  and rack his unfortunate brain to pick and choose words  properly to tell his story  yet at the same time to lead his readers  through the mazes of this very ticklish adventure  without a single  thorn scratching their delicate feelings  or as much as making the  smallest rent in the white muslin robe of propriety  so  not to run  unnecessary risks  the story must go on another way     when shan more and the rest of the  big blackguards  began to wake  the  morning after the abduction  and gave a turn or two under their heather  coverlid  and rubbed their eyes as the sun peeped through the  curtains  of the east   for these were the only bed curtains shan more and his  companions ever had  they stretched themselves and yawned  and felt  very thirsty  for they had all been blind drunk the night before  be it  remembered  and shan more  to use his own expressive and poetic  imagery  swore that his tongue was  as rough as a rat s back   while  his companions went no further than saying theirs were as  dry as a  lime burner s wig   we should not be so particular in those minute  details but for that desire of truth which has guided us all through  this veracious history and as in this scene  in particular  we feel  ourselves sure to be held seriously responsible for every word  we are  determined to be accurate to a nicety  and set down every syllable with  stenographic strictness      where s the girl   cried shan  not yet sober      she s asleep with your sisther   was the answer      down stairs   inquired shan      yes   said the other  who now knew that big jack was more drunk than he  at first thought him  by his using the words  stairs   for jack when he  was drunk was very grand  and called  down the ladder   down  stairs        get me a drink o  wather   said jack   for i m thundherin  thirsty  and  can t deludher that girl with soft words till i wet my mouth      his attendant vagabond obeyed the order  and a large pitcher full of  water was handed to the master  who heaved it upwards to his head and  drank as audibly and nearly as much as a horse  then holding his hands  to receive the remaining contents of the pitcher  which his followers  poured into his monstrous palms  he soused his face  which he afterwards  wiped in a wisp of grass  the only towel of jack s which was not then at  the wash     having thus made his toilet  big jack went downstairs  and as soon as  his great bull head had disappeared beneath the trap  one of the men  above said   we ll have a  shilloe  soon  boys      and sure enough they did before long hear an extraordinary row  jack  first roared for bridget  and no answer was returned  the call was  repeated with as little effect  and at last a most tremendous roar was  heard above  but not from a female voice  jack was heard below  swearing  like a trooper  and  in a minute or two  back he rushed   up stairs    and began cursing his myrmidons most awfully  and foaming at the mouth  with rage      what s the matther   cried the men      matther   roared jack   oh  you  tarnal villains  you re a purty set to  carry off a girl for a man  a purty job you ve made of it       arrah  didn t we bring her to you        her   indeed  bring  her   much good what you brought is to me       tare an  ouns  what s the matther at all  we dunna what you mane    shouted the men  returning rage for rage      come down  and you ll see what s the matther   said jack  descending  the ladder  and the men hastened after him     he led the way to the further end of the cabin  where a small glimmering  of light was permitted to enter from the top  and lifting a tattered  piece of canvas  which served as a screen to the bed  he exclaimed  with  a curse   look there  you blackguards      the men gave a shout of surprise  for  what do you think they saw   an  empty bed           chapter xlii      it may be remembered that  on father phil s recommendation  andy was  to be removed out of the country to place him beyond the reach of larry  hogan s machinations  and that the proposed journey to london afforded a  good opportunity of taking him out of the way  andy had been desired  by squire egan to repair to merryvale  but as some days had elapsed and  andy had not made his appearance  the alarms of the squire that andy  might be tampered with began to revive  and dick dawson was therefore  requested to call at the widow rooney s cabin as he was returning from  the town  where some business with murphy  about the petition against  scatterbrain s return  demanded his presence     dick  as it happened  had no need to call at the widow s  for on his way  to the town who should he see approaching but the renowned andy himself   on coming up to him  dick pulled up his horse  and andy pulled off his  hat      god save your honour   said andy      why didn t you come to merryvale  as you were bid   said dick      i couldn t  sir  becase        hold your tongue  you thief  you know you never can do what you re  bid  you are always wrong one way or other       you re hard on me  misther dick       did you ever do anything right   i ask yourself       indeed  sir  this time it was a rale bit o  business i had to do       and well you did it  no doubt  did you marry any one lately   said  dick  with a waggish grin and a wink      faix  then  maybe i did   said andy  with a knowing nod      and i hope  matty  is well   said dick      ah  misther dick  you re always goin  on with your jokin   so you are   so  you heerd o  that job  did you  faix  a purty lady she is  oh  it s  not her at all i am married to  but another woman       another woman   exclaimed dick  in surprise      yis  sir  another woman  a kind craythur       another woman   reiterated dick  laughing   married to two women in two  days  why you re worse than a turk       ah  misther dick       you tarquin       sure  sir  what harm s in it        you heliogabalus        sure  it s no fault o  mine  sir       bigamy  by this and that  flat bigamy  you ll only be hanged  as sure  as your name s andy       sure  let me tell you how it was  sir  and you ll see i am quit of all  harm  good or bad   t was a pack o  blackguards  you see  come to take  off oonah  sir       oh  a case of abduction       yis  sir  so the women dhressed me up as a girl  and the blackguards   instead of the seduction of oonah  only seduced me       capital   cried dick   well done  andy  and who seduced you       shan  more    faith  no less       ho  ho  a dangerous customer to play tricks on  andy       sure enough   faith  and that s partly the rayson of what happened   but  by good luck  big jack was blind dhrunk when i got there  and i  shammed screechin  so well that his sisther took pity on me  and said  she d keep me safe from harm in her own bed that night      dick gave a  view hallo  when he heard this  and shouted with laughter   delighted at the thought of shan more  instead of carrying off a girl  for himself  introducing a gallant to his own sister      oh  now i see how you are married   said dick   that was the biter bit  indeed       oh  the divil a bit i d ha  bit her only for the cross luck with  me  for i wanted to schame off out o  the place  and escape  but she  wouldn t let me  and cotch me and brought me back       i should think she would  indeed   said dick  laughing   what next       why i drank a power o  punch  sir  and was off my guard  you see  and  couldn t keep the saycret so well afther that  and by dad she found it  out       just what i would expect of her   said dick      well  do you know  sir  though the thrick was agen her own brother   she laughed at it a power  and said i was a great divil  but that she  couldn t blame me  so then i d sthruv to coax her to let me make my  escape  but she told me to wait a bit till the men above was faster  asleep  but while i was waitin  for them to go to sleep  faix  i went to  asleep myself  i was so tired  and when bridget  the crathur   woke me  in the morning  she was cryin  like a spout afther a thunder storm  and  said her characther would be ruined when the story got abroad over the  counthry  and sure she darn t face the world if i wouldn t make her an  honest woman       the brazen baggage   said dick   and what did you say       why what could any man say  sir  afther that  sure her karacther would  be gone if        gone   said dick    faith it might have gone further before it fared  worse       arrah  what do you mane  misther dick       pooh  pooh  andy  you don t mean to say you married that one       faix  i did   said andy      well  andy   said dick  grinning   by the powers  you  have  done it  this time  good morning to you   and dick put spurs to his horse           chapter xliii      andy   knocked all of a heap   stood in the middle of the road  looking  after dick as he cantered down the slope  it was seldom poor andy was  angry  but he felt a strong sense of indignation choking him as dick s  parting words still rung in his ears   what does he mane   said andy   talking aloud   what does he mane   he repeated  anxious to doubt and  therefore question the obvious construction which dick s words bore    misther dick is fond of a joke  and maybe this is one of his making   but if it is   t is not a fair one   pon my sowl  a poor man has his  feelin s as well as a rich man  how would you like your own wife to  be spoke of that way  misther dick  as proud as you ride your horse  there  humph      andy  in great indignation  pursued his way towards his mother s cabin  to ask her blessing upon his marriage  on his presenting himself there   both the old woman and oonah were in great delight at witnessing his  safe return  oonah particularly  for she  feeling that it was for her  sake andy placed himself in danger  had been in a state of great anxiety  for the result of the adventure  and  on seeing him  absolutely threw  herself into his arms  and embraced him tenderly  impressing many a  hearty kiss upon his lips  between whiles that she vowed she would never  forget his generosity and courage  and ending with saying there was   nothing  she would not do for him     now andy was flesh and blood like other people  and as the showers of  kisses from oonah s ripe lips fell fast upon him he was not insensible  to the embrace of so very pretty a girl  a girl  moreover  he had always  had a  sneaking kindness  for  which oonah s distance of manner alone  had hitherto made him keep to himself  but now  when he saw her eyes  beam gratitude  and her cheek flush  after her strong demonstration of  regard  and heard her last words  so  very  like a hint to a shy man   it must be owned a sudden pang shot through poor andy s heart  and he  sickened at the thought of being married  which placed the tempting  prize before him hopelessly beyond his reach     he looked so blank  and seemed so unable to return oonah s fond  greeting  that she felt the pique which every pretty woman experiences  who fancies her favours disregarded  and thought andy the stupidest lout  she ever came across  turning up her hair  which had fallen down in the  excess of her friendship  she walked out of the cottage  and  biting her  disdainful lip  fairly cried for spite     in the meantime  andy popped down on his knees before the widow  and  said   give me your blessing  mother       for what  you omadhawn   said his mother  fiercely  for her woman s  nature took part with oonah s feelings  which she quite comprehended   and she was vexed with what she thought andy s disgusting insensibility    for what should i give you my blessing       bekase i m marri d  ma am       what   exclaimed the mother   it s not marri d again you are  you re  jokin  sure       faix  it s no joke   said andy  sadly   i m marri d sure enough  so  give us your blessin   anyhow   cried he  still kneeling      and who did you  dar   for to marry  sir  if i make so bowld to ax   without  my  lave or license       there was

throwing them upwards in appeals  to heaven  while andy still kept kneeling in the middle of the cabin   lost in wonder     the widow ran to the door and called oonah in      who do you think that

in passionate exclamations  blamed herself for all that had happened  saying it was in the endeavour  to save her that andy had lost himself      oh  oonah  oonah   said andy  with more meaning in his

before dishonour  i ll go  list for a sojer  and never live  with her            chapter xliv      it has been necessary in an earlier chapter to notice the strange freaks  madness will sometimes play  it was then the object to show how strong  affections of the mind will recall an erring judgment to its true  balance  but  the action of the counterpoise growing weaker by time   the disease returns  and reason again kicks the beam  such was the old  dowager s case  the death of her son recalled her to herself  but a few  days produced relapse  and she was as foolish as ever  nevertheless  as  polonius remarks of hamlet        there is method in his madness      so in the dowager s case there was method  not of a sane intention   as the old courtier implies of the danish prince  but of  in sane  birth  begot of a chivalrous feeling on an enfeebled mind     to make this clearly understood it is necessary to call attention to  one other peculiarity of madness   that  while it makes those under  its influence liable to say and enact all sorts of nonsense on some  subjects  it never impairs their powers of observation on those which  chance to come within the reach of the un diseased portion of the mind   and moreover  they are quite as capable of arriving at just conclusions  upon what they  so  see and hear  as the most reasonable person  and   perhaps  in proportion as the reasoning power is limited within a  smaller compass  so the capability of observation becomes stronger by  being concentrated     such was the case with the old dowager  who  while furlong was  doing  devotion  to augusta  and appeared the pink of faithful swains  saw very  clearly that furlong did not like it a bit  and would gladly be off his  bargain  yea  while the people in their sober senses on the same plane  with the parties were taken in  the old lunatic  even from the toppling  height of her own mad chimney pot  could look down and see that furlong  would not marry augusta if he could help it     it  was  even so  furlong had acted under the influence of terror when  poor augusta  shoved into his bedroom through the devilment of that  rascally imp  ratty  and found there  through the evil destiny of andy   was flung into his arms by her enraged father  and accepted as his wife   the immediate hurry of the election had delayed the marriage  the  duel and its consequences further interrupted  the happy event   and  o grady s death caused a further postponement  it was delicately hinted  to furlong  that when matters had gone so far as to the wedding dresses  being ready  that the sooner the contracting parties under such  circumstances were married  the better  but furlong  with that  affectation of propriety which belongs to his time serving  tribe  pleaded the  regard to appearances    so soon after the  ever to be deplored event    and other such specious excuses  which  were but covers to his own rascality  and used but to postpone the   wedding day   the truth was  the moment furlong had no longer the  terrors of o grady s pistol before his eyes  he had resolved never to  take so bad a match as that with augusta appeared to be  indeed was  as  far as regarded money  though furlong should only have been too glad  to be permitted to mix his plebeian blood with the daughter of a man  of high family  whose crippled circumstances and consequent truckling  conduct had reduced him to the wretched necessity of making  such a cur   as furlong the inmate of his house  but so it was     the family began at last to suspect the real state of the case  and all  were surprised except the old dowager  she had expected what was coming   and had prepared herself for it  all her pistol practice was with a view  to call furlong to the  last arbitrament  for this slight to her house   gusty was too young  she considered  for the duty  therefore she  in  her fantastic way of looking at the matter  looked upon  herself  as the  head of the family  and  as such  determined to resent the affront put  upon it     but of her real design the family at neck or nothing hall had not the  remotest notion  of course  an old lady going about with a pistol   powder flask  and bullets  and practising on the trunks of the trees in  the park  could not pass without observation  and surmises there were  on the subject  then her occasional exclamation of  tremble  villain    would escape her  and sometimes in the family circle  after sitting for  a while in a state of abstraction  she would lift her attenuated hand  armed with a knitting needle or a ball of worsted  and assuming the  action of poising a pistol  execute a smart  click  with her tongue  and  say   i hit him that time      these exclamations  indicative of vengeance  were supposed at length  by the family to apply to edward o connor  but excited pity rather than  alarm  when  however  one morning  the dowager was nowhere to be  found  and ratty and the pistols had also disappeared  an inquiry was  instituted as to the old lady s whereabouts  and mount eskar was one  of the first places where she was sought  but without success  and all  other inquiries were equally unavailing     the old lady had contrived  with that cunning peculiar to insane people   to get away from the house at an early hour in the morning  unknown to  all except ratty  to whom she confided her intention  and he managed to  get her out of the domain unobserved  and thence together they proceeded  to dublin in a post chaise  it was the day after this secret expedition  was undertaken that mr  furlong was sitting in his private apartment  at the castle  doing  the state some service  by reading the morning  papers  which heavy official duty he relieved occasionally by turning  to some scented notes which lay near a morocco writing case  whence they  had been drawn by the lisping dandy to flatter his vanity  he had been  carrying on a correspondence with an anonymous fair one  in whose heart   if her words might be believed  furlong had made desperate havoc     it happened  however  that these notes were all fictitious  being the  work of tom loftus  who enjoyed playing on a puppy as much as playing on  the organ  and he had the satisfaction of seeing furlong going through  his paces in certain squares he had appointed  wearing a flower of tom s  choice and going through other antics which tom had demanded under  the signature of  phillis   written in a delicate hand on pink satin  note paper with a lace border  one of the last notes suggested the  possibility of a visit from the lady  and  after assurances of  secrecy  and honour  had been returned by furlong  he was anxiously expecting   what would become of it   and filled with pleasing reflections of what   a devil of a fellow  he was among the ladies  he occasionally paced  the room before a handsome dressing glass  with which his apartment  was always furnished   and ran his fingers through his curls with a  complacent smile  while thus occupied  and in such a frame of mind  the  hall messenger entered the apartment  and said a lady wished to see him      a lady   exclaimed furlong  in delighted surprise      she won t give her name  sir  but        show her up  show her up   exclaimed the lothario  eagerly     all anxiety  he awaited the appearance of his donna  and quite a donna  she seemed  as a commanding figure  dressed in black  and enveloped in a  rich veil of the same  glided into the room      how vewy spanish   exclaimed furlong  as he advanced to meet his  incognita  who  as soon as she entered  locked the door  and withdrew  the key      quite pwactised in such secwet affairs   said furlong slily   fai   lady  allow me to touch you  fai  hand  and lead you to a seat      the mysterious stranger made no answer  but lifting her long veil   turned round on the lisping dandy  who staggered back  when the dowager  o grady appeared before him  drawn up to her full height  and anything  but an agreeable expression in her eye  she stalked up towards him   something in the style of a spectre in a romance  which she was not  very unlike  and as she advanced  he retreated  until he got the table  between him and this most unwelcome apparition      i am come   said the dowager  with an ominous tone of voice      vewy happy of the hono   i am sure  mistwess o gwady   faltered  furlong      the avenger has come   furlong opened his eyes   i have come to wash  the stain   said she  tapping her fingers in a theatrical manner on the  table  and  as it happened  she pointed to a large blotch of ink on the  table cover  furlong opened his eyes wider than ever  and thought this  the queerest bit of madness he ever heard of  however  thinking it best  to humour her  he answered   yes  it was a little awkwa dness of mine  i  upset the inkstand the othe  day       do you mock me  sir   said she  with increasing bitterness      la  no  mistwess o gwady       i have come  i say  to wash out in your blood the stain you have dared  to put on the name of o grady      furlong gasped with mingled amazement and fear      tremble  villain   she said  and she pointed toward him her long  attenuated finger with portentous solemnity      illustration  the challenge      i weally am quite at a loss  mistwess o gwady  to compwehend       before he could finish his sentence  the dowager had drawn from the  depths of her side pockets a brace of pistols  and presenting them to  furlong  said   be at a loss no longer  except the loss of life which  may ensue  take your choice of weapons  sir       gwacious heaven   exclaimed furlong  trembling from head to foot      you won t choose  then   said the dowager   well  there s one for you    and she laid a pistol before him with as courteous a manner as if she  were making him a birthday present     furlong stared down upon it with a look of horror      now we must toss for choice of ground   said the dowager   i have no  money about me  for i paid my last half crown to the post boy  but this  will do as well for a toss as anything else   and she laid her hands  on the dressing glass as she spoke   now the call shall be  safe   or   smash   whoever calls  safe   if the glass comes down unbroken  has the  choice  and  vice versa   i call first    smash     said the dowager  as  she flung up the dressing glass  which fell in shivers on the floor   i  have won   said she   oblige me  sir  by standing in that far corner   i have the light in my back  and you will have something else in yours  before long  take your ground  sir      furlong  finding himself thus cooped up with a mad woman  in an agony of  terror suddenly bethought himself of instances he had heard of escape   under similar circumstances  by coinciding to a certain extent with the  views of the insane people  and suggested to the dowager that he hoped  she would not insist on a duel without their having a  friend  present      i beg your pardon  sir   said the old lady   i quite forgot that  form  in the excitement of the moment  though i have not overlooked the  necessity altogether  and have come provided with one       allow me to wing for him   said furlong  rushing to the bell      stop   exclaimed the dowager  levelling her pistol at the bell pull    touch it  and you are a dead man      furlong stood riveted to the spot where his rush had been arrested      no interruption  sir  till this little affair is settled  here is my  friend   she added  putting her hand into her pocket and pulling out the  wooden cuckoo of her clock   my little bird  sir  will see fair between  us   and she perched the painted wooden thing  with a bit of feather  grotesquely sticking up out of its nether end  on the morocco  letter case      oh  lord   said furlong      he s a gentleman of the nicest honour  sir   said the dowager  pacing  back to the window     furlong took advantage of the opportunity of her back being turned  and  rushed at the bell  which he pulled with great fury     the dowager wheeled round with haste   so you have rung   said she    but it shall not avail you  the door is locked  take your weapon   sir   quick   what   a coward       weally  mistwess o gwady  i cannot think of deadly arbitrament with a  lady       less would you like it with a man   poltroon    said she  with an  exaggerated expression of contempt in her manner   however   she added    if you  are  a coward  you shall have a coward s punishment   she went  to a corner where stood a great variety of handsome canes  and laying  hold of one  began soundly to thrash furlong  who feared to make any  resistance or attempt to disarm her of the cane  for the pistol was yet  in her other hand     the bell was answered by the servant  who  on finding the door locked   and hearing the row inside  began to knock and inquire loudly what was  the matter  the question was more loudly answered by furlong  who roared  out   bweak the door  bweak the door   interlarding his directions with  cries of  mu der      the door at length was forced  furlong rescued  and the old lady  separated from him  she became perfectly calm the moment other persons  appeared  and was replacing the pistols in her pocket  when furlong  requested the  dweadful weapons  might be seized  the old lady gave up  the pistols very quietly  but laid hold of her bird and put it back into  her pocket      this is a dweadful violation   said furlong   and my life is not safe  unless she is bound ove  to keep the peace       pooh  pooh   said one of the gentlemen from the adjacent office  who  came to the scene on hearing the uproar   binding over an old lady to  keep the peace  nonsense       i insist upon it   said furlong  with that stubbornness for which fools  are so remarkable      oh  very well   said the sensible gentleman  who left the room     a party  pursuant to furlong s determination  proceeded to the head  police office close by the castle  and a large mob gathered as they went  down cork hill and followed them to exchange court  where they crowded  before them in front of the office  so that it was with difficulty the  principals could make their way through the dense mass     at length  however  they entered the office  and when major sir heard  any gentleman attached to the government wanted his assistance  of  course he put any other case aside  and had the accuser and accused  called up before him     furlong made his charge of assault and battery  with intent to murder    c    c   some mad old rebel  i suppose   said major sir   do you  remember      ma am   said the major      indeed i do  sir  and i remember  you  too  major sir i have the honour  to address  if i don t mistake       yes  ma am  what then       i remember well in     when you were searching for rebels  you thought  a man was concealed in a dairy yard in the neighbourhood of my mother s  house  major  in stephen s green  and you thought he was hid in a  hay rick  and ordered your sergeant to ask for the loan of a spit from  my mother s kitchen to probe the haystack       oh  then  madam  your mother was  loyal   i suppose       most loyal  sir       give the lady a chair   said the major      thank you  i don t want it  but  major  when you asked for the spit   my mother thought you were going to practise one of your delightfully  ingenious bits of punishment  and asked the sergeant  who it was you  were going to roast       the major grew livid on the bench where he sat  at this awkward  reminiscence of one of his friends  and a dead silence reigned through  the crowded office  he recovered himself  however  and addressed mrs   o grady in a mumbling manner  telling her she must give security to keep  the peace  herself  and find friends as sureties  on asking her had she  any friends to appear for her  she declared she had      a gentleman of the nicest honour  sir   said the dowager  pulling her  cuckoo from her pocket  and holding it up in view of the whole office     a shout of laughter  of course  followed  the affair became at once  understood in its true light  a mad old lady  a paltry coward   c    c   those who know the excitability and fun of an irish mob will not  wonder that  when the story got circulated from the office to the crowd  without  which it did with lightning rapidity  the old lady  on being  placed in a hackney coach which was sent for  was hailed with a chorus  of  cuckoo   by the multitude  one half of which ran after the coach  as long as they could keep pace with it  shouting forth the spring time  call  and the other half followed furlong to the castle  with hisses and  other more articulate demonstrations of their contempt           chapter xlv      the fat and fair widow flanagan had  at length  given up  shilly shallying  and yielding to the fervent entreaties of tom durfy   had consented to name the happy day  she  would  have some little  ways of her own about it  however  and instead of being married in the  country  insisted on the nuptial knot being tied in dublin  thither  the widow repaired with her swain to complete the stipulated time of  residence within some metropolitan parish before the wedding could  take place  in the meanwhile they enjoyed all the gaiety the capital  presented  the time glided swiftly by  and tom was within a day of being  made a happy man  when  as he was hastening to the lodgings of the fair  widow  who was waiting with her bonnet and shawl on to be escorted to  the botanical gardens at glasnevin  he was accosted by an odd looking  person of somewhat sinister aspect      i believe i have the honour of addressing mister durfy  sir   tom  answered in the affirmative    thomas  durfy  esquire  i think  sir       yes       this is for you  sir   he said  handing tom a piece of dirty printed  paper  and at the same time laying his hand on tom s shoulder and  executing a smirking sort of grin  which he meant to be the pattern  of politeness  added   you ll excuse me  sir  but i arrest you under a  warrant from the high sheriff of the city of dublin  always sorry  sir   for a gintleman in defficulties  but it s my duty       you re a bailiff  then   said tom      sir   said the bum         honour and shame from no condition rise     act well your part  there all the honour lies        i meant no offence   said tom   i only meant        i understand  sir  i understand  these little defficulties startles  gintlemen at first  you ve not been used to arrest  i see  sir       never in my life did such a thing happen before   said tom   i live  generally  thank god  where a bailiff daren t show his face       ah  sir   said the bailiff with a grin   them rustic habits betrays  the children o  nature often when they come to town  but we are  so  fisticated  here in the metropolis  that we lay our hands on strangers  aisy  but you d better not stand in the street  sir  or people will  understand it s an arrest  sir  and i suppose you wouldn t like the  exposure  i can simperise in a gintle man s feelings  sir  if you  walk aisy on  sir  and don t attempt to escape or rescue  i ll keep a  gentlemanlike distance      tom walked on in great perplexity for a few steps  not knowing what  to do  the hour of his rendezvous had struck  he knew how impatient of  neglect the widow always was  he at one moment thought of asking the  bailiff to allow him to proceed to her lodgings at once  there boldly  to avow what had taken place and ask her to discharge the debt  but  this his pride would not allow him to do  as he came to the corner of a  street  he got a tap on the elbow from the bailiff  who  with a jerking  motion of his thumb and a wink  said in a confidential tone to tom    down this street  sir  that s the way to the  pres n   prison        prison   exclaimed tom  halting involuntarily at the word      shove on  sir  shove on   hastily repeated the sheriff s officer   urging his orders by a nudge or two on tom s elbow      don t shove me  sir   said tom  rather angrily   or by g        aisy  sir  aisy   said the bailiff   though i feel for the defficulties  of a gintleman  the caption must be made  sir  if you don t like the  pris n  i have a nice little room o  my own  sir  where you can wait   for a small consideration  until you get bail       i ll go there  then   said tom   go through as private streets as you  can       give me half a guinea for my trouble  sir  and i ll ambulate you  through lanes every  fut  o  the way       very well   said tom     they now struck into a shabby street  and thence wended through stable  lanes  filthy alleys  up greasy broken steps  through one close  and  down steps in another  threaded dark passages whose debouchures were  blocked up with posts to prevent vehicular conveyance  the accumulated  dirt of years sensible to the tread from its lumpy unevenness  and the  stagnant air rife with pestilence  tom felt increasing disgust at every  step he proceeded  but anything to him appeared better than being seen  in the public streets in such company  for  until they got into these  labyrinths of nastiness  tom thought he saw in the looks of every  passer by  as plainly told as if the words were spoken   there goes a  fellow under the care of the bailiff   in these by ways  he had not any  objection to speak to his companion  and for the first time asked him  what he was arrested for      at the suit of mr  m kail  sir       oh  the tailor   said tom      yes  sir   said the bailiff   and if you would not consider it trifling  with the feelings of a gintleman in defficulties  i would make the  playful observation  sir  that it s quite in character to be arrested at  the  suit  of a tailor  he  he  he       you re a wag  i see   said tom      oh no  sir  only a poetic turn  a small affection i have certainly for  judy mot  but my rale passion is the muses  we are not far now  sir   from my little bower of repose  which is the name i give my humble  abode  small  but snug  sir  you ll see another gintleman there  sir   before you  he is waitin  for bail these three or four days  sir  can t  pay as he ought for the  commodation  but he s a friend o  mine  i may  almost say  sir  a litherary gintleman  them litherary gintlemen is  always in defficulties mostly  i suppose you re a litherary gintleman   sir  though you re rather ginteely dhressed for one       no   said tom   i am not       i thought you wor  sir  by being acquainted with this other gintleman       an acquaintance of mine   said tom  with surprise      yes  sir  in short it was through him i found out where you wor  sir   i have had the wret agen you for some time  but couldn t make you off   till my friend says i must carry a note from him to you       where is the note   inquired tom      not ready yet  sir  it s po thry he s writin   something  pithy   he said  and  lame  too  i dunna how a thing could be pithy and lame  together  but them potes has hard words at command       then you came away without the note       yis  sir  as soon as i found out where you wor stopping i ran off  directly on mr  m kail s little business  you ll excuse the liberty   sir  but we must all mind our professions  though  indeed  sir  if you  b lieve me  i d rather nab a rhyme than a gintleman any day  and if i  could get on the press i d quit the shoulder tapping profession      tom cast an eye of wonder on the bailiff  which the latter comprehended  at once  for with habitual nimbleness he could nab a man s thoughts as  fast as his person   i know what you re thinkin   sir  could one of my  profession pursue the muses  don t think  sir  i mane i could write the   laders  or the pollitik l articles  but the criminal cases  sir  the  robberies and offinces  with the watchhouse cases  together with a  little po thry now and then  i think i could be useful  sir  and do  better than some of the chaps that pick up their ha pence that way  but  here s my place  sir  my little bower of repose      he knocked at the door of a small tumble down house in a filthy lane   the one window it presented in front being barred with iron  some bolts  were drawn inside  and though the man who opened the door was forbidding  in his aspect  he did not refuse to let tom in  the portal was hastily  closed and bolted after they had entered  the smell of the house was  pestilential  the entry dead dark      give me your hand  sir   said the bailiff  leading tom forward  they  ascended some creaking stairs  and the bailiff  fumbling for some time  with a key at a door  unlocked it and shoved it open  and then led in  his captive  tom saw a shabby genteel sort of person  whose back was  towards him  directing a letter      ah  goggins   said the writer   you re come back in the nick of time  i  have finished now  and you may take the letter to mister durfy       you may give it to him yourself  sir   replied goggins   for here he  is       indeed   said the writer  turning round      what   exclaimed tom durfy  in surprise   james reddy       even so   said james  with a sentimental air         the paths of glory lead but to the grave      literature is a bad trade  my dear tom    tis an ungrateful world  men  of the highest aspirations may lie in gaol for all the world cares   not that you come within the pale of the worthless ones  this is  good natured of you to come and see a friend in trouble  you deserve  my  dear tom  that you should have been uppermost in my thoughts  for here  is a note i have just written to you  enclosing a copy of verses to you  on your marriage  in short  it is an epithalamium       that s what i told you  sir   said goggins to tom      may the divil burn you and your epithalamium   said tom durfy  stamping  round the little room     james reddy stared in wonder  and goggins roared  laughing      a pretty compliment you ve paid me  mister reddy  this fine morning    said tom   you tell a bailiff where i live  that you may send your  infernal verses to me  and you get me arrested       oh  murder   exclaimed james   i m very sorry  my dear tom  but  at the  same time   t is a capital incident  how it would work up in a farce       how funny it is   said tom in a rage  eyeing james as if he could have  eaten him   bad luck to all poetry and poetasters  by the  tarnal war   i wish every poet  from homer down  was put into a mortar and pounded to  death      james poured forth expressions of sorrow for the mischance  and  extremely ludicrous it was to see one man making apologies for trying  to pay his friend a compliment  his friend swearing at him for his  civility  and the bailiff grinning at them both     in this triangular dilemma we will leave them for the present           chapter xlvi      edward o connor  on hearing from gustavus of the old dowager s  disappearance from neck or nothing hall  joined in the eager inquiries  which were made about her  and  his  being directed with more method and  judgment than those of others  their result was more satisfactory  he  soon  took up the trail   to use an indian phrase  and he and gusty were  not many hours in posting after the old lady  they arrived in town early  in the morning  and lost no time in casting about for information     one of the first places edward inquired at was the inn where the  postchaise generally drove to from the house where the old dowager had  obtained her carriage in the country  but there no trace was to be had   next  the principal hotels were referred to  but as yet without success   when  as they turned into one of the leading streets in continuance of  their search  their attention was attracted by a crowd swaying to and  fro in that peculiar manner which indicates there is a fight inside  of it  great excitement prevailed on the verge of the crowd  where  exclamations escaped from those who could get a peep at the fight      the little chap has great heart   cried one      but the sweep is the biggest   said another      well done   horish     footnote  the name of a celebrated sweep in  ireland  whose name is applied to the whole   cried a blackguard  who  enjoyed the triumph of his fellow   bravo  little fellow   rejoined  a genteel person  who rejoiced in some successful hit of the other  combatant  there is an inherent love in men to see a fight  which edward  o connor shared with inferior men  and if  he  had not peeped into the  ring  most assuredly gusty would  what was their astonishment  when they  got a glimpse of the pugilists  to perceive ratty was one of them  his  antagonist being a sweep  taller by a head  and no bad hand at the   noble science      edward s first impulse was to separate them  but gusty requested he  would not  saying that he saw by ratty s eye he was able to  lick the  fellow   ratty certainly showed great fight  what the sweep had in  superior size was equalized by the superior  game  of the gentleman boy   to whom the indomitable courage of a high blooded race had descended   and who would sooner have died than yield  besides  ratty was not  deficient in the use of his  bunch of fives   hit hard for his size   and was very agile  the sweep sometimes made a rush  grappled  and got  a fall  but he never went in without getting something from ratty to   remember him   and was not always uppermost  at last  both were so far  punished  and the combat not being likely to be speedily ended  for the  sweep was no craven   that the bystanders interfered  declaring that   they ought to be separated   and they were     while the crowd was dispersing  edward called a coach  and before ratty  could comprehend how the affair was managed  he was shoved into it and  driven from the scene of action  ratty had a confused sense of hearing  loud shouts  of being lifted somewhere  of directions given  the rattle  of iron steps clinking sharply  two or three fierce bangs of a door that  wouldn t shut  and then an awful shaking  which roused him up from the  corner of the vehicle into which he had fallen in the first moment of  exhaustion  ratty  shook his feathers   dragged his hair from out of his  eyes  which were getting very black indeed  and applied his handkerchief  to his nose  which was much in need of that delicate attention  and when  the sense of perfect vision was restored to him  which was not for some  time  all the colours of the rainbow dancing before ratty s eyes for  many seconds after the fight   what was his surprise to see edward  o connor and gusty sitting on the opposite seat     it was some time before ratty could quite comprehend his present  situation  but as soon as he was made sensible of it  and could answer   the first questions asked of him were about his grandmother  ratty  fortunately remembered the name of the hotel where she put up  though  he had left it as soon as the old lady proceeded to the castle  had lost  his way  and got engaged in a quarrel with a sweep in the meantime     the coach was ordered to drive to the hotel named  and how the fight  occurred was the next question      the sweep was passing by  and i called him  snow ball    said ratty    and the blackguard returned an impudent answer  and i hit him       you had no right to call him  snow ball    said edward      i always called the sweeps  snow ball  down at the hall   said ratty    and they never answered       when you are on your own territory you may say what you please to your  dependents  ratty  and they dare not answer  or to use a vulgar saying    a cock may crow on his own dunghill        i m no dunghill cock   said ratty  fiercely      indeed  you re not   said edward  laying his hand kindly on the boy s  shoulder   you have plenty of courage       i d have licked him   said ratty   if they d have let me have two or  three rounds more       my dear boy  other things are needful in this world besides courage   prudence  temper  and forbearance are required  and this may be a lesson  to you  to remember  that  when you get abroad in the world  you are  very little cared about  however great your consequence may be at home   and i am sure you cannot be proud about your having got into a quarrel   with a sweep       ratty made no answer  his blood began to cool  he became every moment  more sensible that he had received heavy blows  his eyes became more  swollen  he snuffled more in his speech  and his blackened condition  altogether  from gutter  soot  and thrashing  convinced him a fight with  a sweep was  not  an enviable achievement     the coach drew up at the hotel  edward left gusty to see about the  dowager  and made an appointment for gusty to meet him at their own  lodgings in an hour  while he in the interim should call on dick dawson   who was in town on his way to london     edward shook hands with ratty and bade him kindly good bye   you re  a stout fellow  ratty   said he   but remember this old saying     quarrelsome dogs get dirty coats        edward now proceeded to dick s lodgings  and found him engaged in  reading a note from tom durfy  dated from the  bower of repose   and  requesting dick s aid in his present difficulty      here s a pretty kettle of fish   said dick   tom durfy  who is engaged  to dine with me to day to take leave of his bachelor life  as he is  going to be married to morrow  is arrested  and now in  quod   and wants  me to bail him       the shortest way is to pay the money at once   said edward   is it  much       that i don t know  but i have not a great deal about me  and what i  have i want for my journey to london and my expenses there  not but what  i d help tom if i could       he must not be allowed to remain  there   however we manage to get him  out   said edward   perhaps i can help you in the affair       you re always a good fellow  ned   said dick  shaking his hand warmly     edward escaped from hearing any praise of himself by proposing they  should repair at once to the sponging house  and see how matters stood   dick lamented he should be called away at such a moment  for he was just  going to get his wine ready for the party  particularly some champagne   which he was desirous of seeing well iced  but as he could not wait to  do it himself  he called andy  to give him directions about it  and set  off with edward to the relief of tom durfy     andy was once more in service in the egan family  for the squire  on  finding him still more closely linked by his marriage with the desperate  party whose influence over andy was to be dreaded  took advantage of  andy s disgust against the woman who had entrapped him  and offered to  take him off to london instead of enlisting  and as andy believed he  would be there sufficiently out of the way of the false bridget  he came  off at once to dublin with dick  who was the pioneer of the party to  london     dick gave andy the necessary directions for icing the champagne  which  he set apart and pointed out most particularly to our hero  lest he  should make a mistake and perchance ice the port instead     after edward and dick had gone  andy commenced operations according to  orders  he brought a large tub up stairs containing rough ice  which  excited andy s wonder  for he never had known till now that ice was  preserved for and applied to such a use  for an ice house did not happen  to be attached to any establishment in which he had served      well  this is the quarest thing i ever heerd of   said andy   musha   what outlandish inventions the quolity has among them  they re not  contint with wine  but they must have ice along with it  and in a tub   too   just like pigs   throth it s a dirty thrick  i think  well  here  goes   said he  and andy opened a bottle of champagne  and poured it  into the tub with the ice   how it fizzes   said andy   faix  it s  almost as lively as the soda wather that bothered me long ago  well  i  know more about things now  sure it s wondherful how a man improves with  practice    and another bottle of champagne was emptied into the tub  as he spoke  thus  with several other complacent comments upon his own  proficiency  andy poured half a dozen of champagne into the tub of ice   and remarked  when he had finished his work  that he thought it would be   mighty cowld on their stomachs      dick and edward all this time were on their way to the relief of tom  durfy  who  though he had cooled down from the boiling pitch to which  the misadventure of the morning had raised him  was still  simmering    with his elbows planted on the rickety table in mr  goggins   bower    and his chin resting on his clenched hands  it was the very state of  mind in which tom was most dangerous     at the other side of the table sat james reddy  intently employed in  writing  his pursed mouth and knitted brows bespoke a labouring state  of thought  and the various crossings  interlinings  and blottings gave  additional evidence of the same  while now and then a rush at a line  which was knocked off in a hurry  with slashing dashes of the pen   and fierce after crossings of  t s   and determined dottings of  i s    declared some thought suddenly seized  and executed with bitter triumph      you seem very  happy in yourself  in what you are writing   said tom    what is it  is it another epithalamium       it is a caustic article against the successful men of the day   said  reddy   they have no merit  sir  none   t is nothing but luck has placed  them where they are  and they ought to be exposed   he then threw down  his pen as he spoke  and  after a silence of some minutes  suddenly put  this question to tom      what do you think of the world        faith  i think it so pleasant a place   said tom   that i m  confoundedly vexed at being kept out of it by being locked up here   and that cursed bailiff is so provokingly free and easy  coming in here  every ten minutes  and making himself at home       why  as for that matter  it is his home  you must remember       but while a gentleman is here for a period   said tom   this room ought  to be considered his  and that fellow has no business here  and then his  bows and scrapes  and talking about the feelings of a gentleman  and all  that   t is enough to make a dog beat his father  curse him  i d like to  choke him       oh  that s merely his manner   said james      want of manners  you mean   said tom   hang me  if he comes up to me  with his rascally familiarity again  but i ll kick him down stairs       my dear fellow  you are excited   said reddy   don t let these  sublunary trifles ruffle your temper  you see how i bear it  and to  recall you to yourself  i will remind you of the question we started  from   what do you think of the world   there s a general question  a  broad question  upon which one may talk with temper and soar above  the petty grievances of life in the grand consideration of so ample a  subject  you see me here  a prisoner like yourself  but i can talk of   the world   come  be a calm philosopher  like me  answer  what do you  think of the world       i ve told you already   said tom   it s a capital place  only for the  bailiffs       i can t agree with you   said james   i think it one vast pool of  stagnant wretchedness  where the  malaria  of injustice holds her scales  suspended  to poison rising talent by giving an undue weight to existing  prejudices      to this lucid and good tempered piece of philosophy  tom could only  answer   you know i am no poet  and i cannot argue with you but   pon my  soul  i  have  known  and  do  know  some uncommon good fellows in the  world       you re wrong  you re wrong  my unsuspecting friend   t is a bad world   and no place for susceptible minds  jealousy pursues talent like its  shadow  superiority alone wins for you the hatred of inferior men  for  instance  why am  i  here  the editor of  my  paper will not allow  my   articles always to appear   prevents their insertion  lest the effect  they would make would cause inquiry  and tend to  my  distinction  and  the consequence is  that the paper  i  came to  uphold  in dublin  is deprived of  my  articles  and  i  don t get paid  while  i  see   inferior  men  without asking for it  loaded with favour   they  are  abroad in affluence  and  i  in captivity and poverty  but one comfort  is  even in disgrace i can write  and they shall get a slashing      thus spoke the calm philosopher  who gave tom a lecture on patience     tom was no great conjuror  but at that moment  like audrey   he thanked  the gods he was not poetical   if there be any one thing more than  another to make an  every day man  content with his average lot  it is  the exhibition of ambitious inferiority  striving for distinction it can  never attain  just given sufficient perception to desire the glory of  success  without power to measure the strength that can achieve it  like  some poor fly  which beats its head against a pane of glass  seeing the  sunshine beyond  but incapable of perceiving the subtle medium which  intervenes  too delicate for its limited sense to comprehend  but too  strong for its limited power to pass  but though tom felt satisfaction  at that moment  he had too good feeling to wound the self love of the  vain creature before him  so  instead of speaking what he thought  viz     what business have you to attempt literature  you conceited fool   he  tried to wean him civilly from his folly by saying   then come back to  the country  james  if you find jealous rivals  here   you know you were  always admired  there        no  sir   said james   even there my merit was unacknowledged       no  no   said tom      well  underrated  at least  even there   that  edward o connor  somehow  or other  i never could tell why  i never saw his great talents  but  somehow or other  people got it into their heads that he was clever       i tell you what it is   said tom  earnestly   ned of the hill has  got into a better place than people s  heads   he has got into their   hearts        there it is   exclaimed james  indignantly   you have caught up the  cuckoo cry  the heart  why  sir  what merit is there in writing about  feelings which any common labourer can comprehend  there s no poetry in  that  true poetry lies in a higher sphere  where you have difficulty  in following the flight of the poet  and possibly may not be fortunate  enough to understand him  that s poetry  sir       i told you i am no poet   said tom   but all i know is  i have felt  my heart warm to some of edward s songs  and  by jingo  i have seen the  women s eyes glisten  and their cheeks flush or grow pale  as they have  heard them  and that s poetry enough for me       well  let mister o connor enjoy his popularity  sir  if popularity it  may be called  in a small country circle  let him enjoy it  i don t envy  him  his   though i think he was rather jealous about mine       ned jealous   exclaimed tom  in surprise      yes  jealous  i never heard him say a kind word of any verses i ever  wrote in my life  and i am certain he has most unkind feelings towards  me       i tell you what it is   said tom   getting up  a bit   i told you i  don t understand poetry  but i  do  understand what s an infinitely  better thing  and that s fine  generous  manly feeling  and if there s  a human being in the world incapable of wronging another in his mind or  heart  or readier to help his fellow man  it is edward o connor  so say  no more  james  if you please      tom had scarcely uttered the last word  when the key was turned in the  door      here s that infernal bailiff again   said tom  whose irritability   increased by reddy s paltry egotism and injustice  was at its  boiling pitch once more  he planted himself firmly in his chair  and  putting on his fiercest frown  was determined to confront mister goggins  with an aspect that should astonish him     the door opened  and mister goggins made his appearance  presenting to  the gentlemen in the room the hinder portion of his person  which made  several indications of courtesy performed by the other half of his body   while he uttered the words   don t be astonished  gentlemen  you ll be  used to it by and by   and with these words he kept backing towards tom   making these nether demonstrations of civility  till tom could plainly  see the seams in the back of mr  goggins s pantaloons     tom thought this was some new touch of the  free and easy  on mister  goggins s part  and  losing all command of himself  he jumped from  his chair  and with a vigorous kick gave mister goggins such a lively  impression of his desire that he should leave the room  that mister  goggins went head foremost down the stairs  pitching his whole weight  upon dick dawson and edward o connor  who were ascending the dark  stairs  and to whom all his bows had been addressed  overwhelmed with  astonishment and twelve stone of bailiff  they were thrown back into the  hall  and an immense uproar in the passage ensued     edward and dick were near coming in for some hard usage from goggins   conceiving it might be a preconcerted attempt on the part of his  prisoners and their newly arrived friends to achieve a rescue  and  while he was rolling about on the ground  he roared to his evil visaged  janitor to look to the door first  and keep him from being  murthered   after     fortunately no evil consequences ensued  until matters could be  explained in the hall  and edward and dick were introduced to the upper  room  from which goggins had been so suddenly ejected     there the bailiff demanded in a very angry tone the cause of  tom s conduct  and when it was found to be  only  a mutual  misunderstanding  that goggins wouldn t take a liberty with a gentleman   in defficulties  for the world  and that tom wouldn t hurt a fly   only  under a mistake   matters were cleared up to the satisfaction of all  parties  and the real business of the meeting commenced   that was to  pay tom s debt out of hand  and when the bailiff saw all demands  fees  included  cleared off  the clouds from his brow cleared off also  he  was the most amiable of sheriff s officers  and all his sentimentality  returned     edward did not seem quite to sympathise with his amiability  so goggins  returned to the charge  while tom and dick were exchanging a few words  with james reddy      you see  sir   said goggins   in the first place  it is quite beautiful  to see the mind in adversity bearing up against the little antediluvian  afflictions that will happen occasionally  and then how fine it is  to remark the spark of generosity that kindles in the noble heart and  rushes to the assistance of the destitute  i do assure you  sir  it is  a most beautiful sight to see the gentlemen in defficulties waitin  here  for their friends to come to their relief  like the last scene in blue  beard  where sister ann waves her han kerchief from the tower  the  tyrant is slain  and virtue rewarded      ah  sir   said he to edward o connor  whose look of disgust at the  wretched den caught the bailiff s attention   don t entertain an  antifassy from first imprissions  which is often desaivin   i do pledge  you my honour  sir  there is no place in the  varsal world where  human nature is visible in more attractive colours than in this humble  retrait      edward could not conceal a smile at the fellow s absurdity  though his  sense of the ridiculous could not overcome the disgust with which the  place inspired him  he gave an admonitory touch to the elbow of dick  dawson  who  with his friend tom durfy  followed edward from the  room  the bailiff bringing up the rear  and relocking the door on the  unfortunate james reddy  who was left  alone in his glory   to finish  his slashing article against the successful men of the day  nothing more  than words of recognition had passed between reddy and edward  in  the first place  edward s appearance at the very moment the other was  indulging in illiberal observations upon him rendered the ill tempered  poetaster dumb  and edward attributed this distance of manner to a  feeling of shyness which reddy might entertain at being seen in such a  place  and therefore had too much good breeding to thrust his civility  on a man who seemed to shrink from it  but when he left the house he  expressed his regret to his companions at the poor fellow s unfortunate  situation     it touched tom durfy s heart to hear these expressions of compassion  coming from the lips of the man he had heard maligned a few minutes  before by the very person commiserated  and it raised his opinion higher  of edward  whose hand he now shook with warm expressions of thankfulness  on his own account  for the prompt service rendered to him  edward  made as light of his own kindness as he could  and begged tom to think  nothing of such a trifle      one word i will say to you  durfy  and i m sure you ll pardon me for  it       could you say a thing to offend me   was the answer      you are to be married soon  i understand       to morrow   said tom      well  my dear durfy  if you owe any more money  take a real friend s  advice  and tell your pretty good hearted widow the whole amount of your  debts before you marry her       my dear o connor   said tom   the money you ve lent me now is all i owe  in the world   t was a tailor s bill  and i quite forgot it  you know   no one ever thinks of a tailor s bill  debts  indeed   added tom  with  surprise   my dear fellow  i never could be much in debt  for the devil  a one would trust me       an excellent reason for your unencumbered state   said edward   and i  hope you pardon me       pardon   exclaimed tom   i esteem you for your kind and manly  frankness      in the course of their progress towards dick s lodgings  edward reverted  to james reddy s wretched condition  and found it was but some petty  debt for which he was arrested  he lamented  in common with dick and  tom  the infatuation which made him desert a duty he could profitably  perform by assisting his father in his farming concerns  to pursue a  literary path  which could never be any other to him than one of thorns     as edward had engaged to meet gusty in an hour  he parted from his  companions and pursued his course alone  but  instead of proceeding  immediately homeward  he retraced his steps to the den of the bailiff  and gave a quiet tap at the door  mister goggins himself answered to the  knock  and began a loud and florid welcome to edward  who stopped his  career of eloquence by laying a finger on his lip in token of silence   a few words sufficed to explain the motive of his visit  he wished to  ascertain the sum for which the gentleman up stairs was detained  the  bailiff informed him  and the money necessary to procure the captive s  liberty was placed in his hand     the bailiff cast one of his melodramatic glances at edward  and said    didn t i tell you  sir  this was the place for calling out the noblest  feelings of human nature       can you oblige me with writing materials   said edward      i can  sir   said goggins  proudly   and with other  materials  too   if you like  and  pon my honour  i ll be proud to drink your health  for  you re a raal gintleman    footnote  the name given in ireland to the  necessary materials for the compounding of whisky punch      edward  in the civilest manner  declined the offer  and wrote  or  rather tried to write  the following note  with a pen like a skewer  ink  something thicker than mud  and on whity brown paper        dear sir   i hope you will pardon the liberty i have taken in your  temporary want of money  you can repay me at your convenience  yours      e  o c      edward left the den  and so did james reddy soon after  a better man   though weak  his heart was not shut to the humanities of life  and  edward s kindness  in opening his eyes to the wrong he had done  one   man  induced in his heart a kinder feeling towards all  he tore up his  slashing article against successful men  would that every disappointed  man would do the same     the bailiff was right  even so low a den as his becomes ennobled by the  presence of active benevolence and prejudice reclaimed           chapter xlvii      edward  on returning to his hotel  found gusty there before him  in  great delight at having seen a  splendid  horse  as he said  which had  been brought for edward s inspection  he having written a note on his  arrival in town to a dealer stating his want of a first rate hunter      he s in the stable now   said gusty   for i desired the man to wait   knowing you would be here soon       i cannot see him now  gusty   said edward   will you have the kindness  to tell the groom i can look at the horse in his own stables when i wish  to purchase      gusty departed to do the message  somewhat in wonder  for edward loved  a fine horse  but the truth was  edward s disposable money  which he had  intended for the purchase of a hunter  had a serious inroad made upon  it by the debts he had discharged for other men  and he was forced  to forego the pleasure he had proposed to himself in the next hunting  season  and he did not like to consume any one s time  or raise false  expectations  by affecting to look at disposable property with the eye  of a purchaser  when he knew it was beyond his reach  and the flimsy  common places of  i ll think of it   or  if i don t see something  better   or any other of the twenty hackneyed excuses which idle people  make  after consuming busy men s time  edward held to be unworthy  he  could ride a hack and deny himself hunting for a whole season  but  he would not unnecessarily consume the useful time of any man for ten  minutes     this may be sneered at by the idle and thoughtless  nevertheless  it is  a part of the minor morality which is ever present in the conduct of a  true gentleman     edward had promised to join dick s dinner party on an impromptu  invitation  and the clock striking the appointed hour warned edward it  was time to be off  so  jumping up on a jaunting car  he rattled off to  dick s lodgings  where a jolly party was assembled ripe for fun     amongst the guests was a rather remarkable man  a colonel crammer  who  had seen a monstrous deal of service  one of tom durfy s friends whom he  had asked leave to bring with him to dinner  of course  dick s card  and a note of invitation for the gallant colonel were immediately  despatched  and he had but just arrived before edward  who found a  bustling sensation in the room as the colonel was presented to those  already assembled  and tom durfy giving whispers  aside  to each  person touching his friend  such as   very remarkable man    seen great  service    a little odd or so    a fund of most extraordinary anecdote     c    c     now this colonel crammer was no other than tom loftus  whose  acquaintance dick wished to make  and who had been invited to the dinner  after a preliminary visit  but tom sent an excuse in his own name  and  preferred being present under a fictitious one  this being one of the  odd ways in which his humour broke out  desirous of giving people a   touch of his quality  before they knew him  he was in the habit of  assuming various characters  a methodist missionary  the patentee  of some unheard of invention  the director of some new joint stock  company  in short  anything which would give him an opportunity of  telling tremendous bouncers was equally good for tom  his reason for  assuming a military guise on this occasion was to bother moriarty  whom  he knew he should meet  and held a special reason for tormenting  and  he knew he could achieve this  by throwing all the stories moriarty was  fond of telling about his own service into the shade  by extravagant  inventions of  hair breadth  scapes  and feats by  flood and  field   indeed  the dinner would not be worth mentioning but for the  extraordinary capers tom cut on the occasion  and the unheard of lies he  squandered     dinner was announced by andy  and with good appetite soup and fish were  soon despatched  sherry followed as a matter of necessity  the second  course appeared  and was not long under discussion when dick called for  the  champagne      andy began to drag the tub towards the table  and dick  impatient of  delay  again called  champagne       i m bringin  it to you  sir   said andy  tugging at the tub      hand it round the table   said dick     andy tried to lift the tub   to hand it round the table   but  finding  he could not manage it  he whispered to dick   i can t get it up  sir      dick  fancying andy meant he had got a flask not in a sufficient state  of effervescence to expel its own cork  whispered in return   draw it   then       i was dhrawin  it to you  sir  when you stopped me       well  make haste with it   said dick      mister dawson  i ll trouble you for a small slice of the turkey   said  the colonel      with pleasure  colonel  but first do me the honour to take champagne   andy  champagne       here it is  sir   said andy  who had drawn the tub close to dick s  chair      where s the wine  sir   said dick  looking first at the tub and then at  andy   there  sir   said andy  pointing down to the ice   i put the wine  into it  as you towld me      dick looked again at the tub  and said   there is not a single bottle  there  what do you mean  you stupid rascal       to be sure  there s no bottle there  sir  the bottles is all on the  sideboord  but every dhrop o  the wine is in the ice  as you towld me   sir  if you put your hand down into it  you ll feel it  sir      the conversation between master and man growing louder as it proceeded  attracted the attention of the whole company  and those near the head  of the table became acquainted as soon as dick with the mistake andy had  made  and could not resist laughter  and as the cause of their merriment  was told from man to man  and passed round the board  a roar of laughter  uprose  not a little increased by dick s look of vexation  which at  length was forced to yield to the infectious merriment around him  and  he laughed with the rest  and making a joke of the disappointment  which  is the very best way of passing one off  he said that he had the honour  of originating at his table a magnificent scale of hospitality  for  though he had heard of company being entertained with a whole hogshead  of claret  he was not aware of champagne being ever served in a tub  before  the company were too determined to be merry to have their  pleasantry put out of tune by so trifling a mishap  and it was generally  voted that the joke was worth twice as much as the wine  nevertheless   dick could not help casting a reproachful look now and then at andy   who had to run the gauntlet of many a joke cut at his expense  while  he waited upon the wags at dinner  and caught a lowly muttered anathema  whenever he passed near dick s chair  in short  master and man were  both glad when the cloth was drawn  and the party could be left to  themselves     then  as a matter of course  dick called on the gentlemen to charge  their glasses and fill high to a toast he had to propose  they would  anticipate to whom he referred  a gentleman who was going to change his  state of freedom for one of a happier bondage   c    c  dick dashed off  his speech with several mirth moving allusions to the change that was  coming over his friend tom  and  having festooned his composition  with the proper quantity of  rosy wreaths    c    c    c   naturally  belonging to such speeches  he wound up with some hearty words  free  from  badinage   and meaning all they conveyed  and finished with the  rhyming benediction of a  long life and a good wife  to him     tom having returned thanks in the same laughing style that dick proposed  his health  and bade farewell to the lighter follies of bachelorship for  the more serious ones of wedlock  the road was now open for any one  who was vocally inclined  dick asked one or two  who said they were not  within a bottle of their singing point yet  but tom durfy was sure his  friend the colonel would favour them      with pleasure   said the colonel   and i ll sing something appropriate  to the blissful situation of philandering in which you have been  indulging of late  my friend  i wish i could give you any idea of the  song as i heard it warbled by the voice of an indian princess  who  was attached to me once  and for whom i ran enormous risks  but no  matter  that s past and gone  but the soft tones of zulima s voice will  ever haunt my heart  the song is a favourite where i heard it  on the  borders of cashmere  and is supposed to be sung by a fond woman in the  valley of the nightingales   tis so in the original  but as we have  no nightingales in ireland  i have substituted the dove in the little  translation i have made  which  if you will allow me  i ll attempt      loud cries of  hear  hear   and tapping of applauding hands on the table  followed  while the colonel gave a few preliminary hems  and after some  little pilot tones from his throat  to show the way  his voice ascended  in all the glory of song     the dove song    i        coo  coo  coo  coo        thus did i hear the turtle dove      coo  coo  coo        murmuring forth her love     and as she flew from tree to tree     how melting seemed the notes to me         coo  coo  coo      so like the voice of lovers        t was passing sweet to hear    the birds within the covers       in the spring time of the year     ii        coo  coo  coo  coo        thus the song s returned again       coo  coo  coo        through the shady glen     but there i wandered lone and sad     while every bird around was glad        coo  coo  coo      thus so fondly murmured they        coo  coo  coo      while  my  love was away     and yet the song to lovers       though sad  is sweet to hear     from birds within the covers       in the spring time of the year      the colonel s song  given with tom loftus  good voice  was received  with great applause  and the fellows all voted it catching  and began   cooing  round the table like a parcel of pigeons      a translation from an eastern poet  you say       yes   said tom       t is not very eastern in its character   said moriarty   i mean a   free  translation  of course   added the mock colonel      would you favour us with the song again  in the original   added  moriarty     tom loftus did not know one syllable of any other language than his own   and it would not have been convenient to talk gibberish to moriarty  who  had a smattering of some of the eastern tongues  so he declined giving  his cashmerian song in its native purity  because  as he said  he never  could manage to speak their dialect  though he understood it reasonably  well      but  there s  a gentleman  i am sure  will sing some other song  and a  better one  i have no doubt   said tom  with a very humble prostration  of his head on the table  and anxious by a fresh song to get out of the  dilemma in which moriarty s question was near placing him      not a better  colonel   said the gentleman who was addressed   but i  cannot refuse your call  and i will do my best  hand me the port wine   pray  i always take a glass of port before i sing  i think  t is good  for the throat  what do you say  colonel       when i want to sing particularly well   said tom   i drink  canary       the gentleman smiled at the whimsical answer  tossed off his glass of  port  and began     lady mine       lady mine  lady mine     take the rosy wreath i twine     all its sweets are less than thine       lady  lady mine     the blush that on thy cheek is found    bloometh fresh the  whole  year round      thy  sweet  breath  as sweet gives  sound        lady  lady mine     ii       lady mine  lady mine     how i love the graceful vine     whose tendrils mock thy ringlets  twine       lady  lady mine     how i love that generous tree     whose ripe clusters promise me    bumpers bright   to pledge to  thee        lady  lady mine     iii       lady mine  lady mine     like the stars that nightly shine     thy sweet eyes shed light divine       lady  lady mine     and as sages wise  of old     from the stars could fate unfold     thy bright eyes  my  fortune told       lady  lady mine      the song was just in the style to catch gentlemen after dinner  the  second verse particularly  and many a glass was emptied of a  bumper  bright   and pledged to the particular   thee    which each individual  had selected for his devotion  edward  at that moment  certainly thought  of fanny dawson     let teetotallers say what they please  there is a genial influence  inspired by wine and song  not in excess  but in that wholesome degree  which stirs the blood and warms the fancy  and as one raises the glass  to the lip  over which some sweet name is just breathed from the depth  of the heart  what libation so fit to pour to absent friends as wine   what  is  wine  it is the grape present in another form  its essence is  there  though the fruit which produced it grew thousands of miles away   and perished years ago  so the object of many a tender thought may  be spiritually present  in defiance of space  and fond recollections  cherished in defiance of time     as the party became more convivial  the mirth began to assume a broader  form  tom durfy drew out moriarty on the subject of his services  that  the mock colonel might throw every new achievement into the shade   and this he did in the most barefaced manner  but mixing so much of  probability with his audacious fiction  that those who were not up to  the joke only supposed him to be  a very great romancer   while those  friends who were in loftus  confidence exhibited a most capacious  stomach for the marvellous  and backed up his lies with a ready  credence  if moriarty told some fearful incident of a tiger hunt  the  colonel capped it with something more wonderful  of slaughtering lions  in a wholesale way  like rabbits  when moriarty expatiated on the  intensity of tropical heat  the colonel would upset him with something  more appalling      now  sir   said loftus   let me ask you what is the greatest amount of  heat you have ever experienced  i say  experienced   not  heard  of  for  that goes for nothing  i always speak from experience       well  sir   said moriarty   i have known it to be so hot in india  that  i have had a hole dug in the ground under my tent  and sat in it   and put a table standing over the hole  to try and guard me from the  intolerable fervour of the eastern sun  and even  then  i was hot  what  do you say to that  colonel   asked moriarty  triumphantly      have you ever been in the west indies   inquired loftus      never   said moriarty  who  once entrapped into this admission   was directly at the colonel s mercy   and the colonel launched out  fearlessly      then  my good sir  you know nothing of heat  i have seen in the west  indies an umbrella burned over a man s head       wonderful   cried loftus  backers       t is strange  sir   said moriarty   that we have never seen that  mentioned by any writer       easily accounted for  sir   said loftus    t is so common a  circumstance  that it ceases to be worthy of observation  an author  writing of this country might as well remark that the apple women are to  be seen sitting at the corners of the streets  that s nothing  sir   but there are two things of which i have personal knowledge   rather   remarkable  one day of intense heat  even for that climate  i was on  a visit at the plantation of a friend of mine  and it was so  out o  the way scorching  that our lips were like cinders  and we  were obliged to have black slaves pouring sangaree down our throats by  gallons  i don t hesitate to say gallons  and we thought we could  not have survived through the day  but what could  we  think of  our   sufferings  when we heard that several negroes  who had gone to sleep  under the shade of some cocoa nut trees  had been scalded to death       scalded   said his friends   burnt  you mean       no  scalded  and  how  do you think  the intensity of the heat had  cracked the cocoa nuts  and the boiling milk inside dropped down and  produced the fatal result  the same day a remarkable accident occurred  at the battery  the french were hovering round the island at the time   and the governor  being a timid man  ordered the guns to be always kept  loaded       i never heard of such a thing in a battery in my life  sir   said  moriarty      nor i either   said loftus   till then       what was the governor s name  sir   inquired moriarty  pursuing his  train of doubt      you must excuse me  captain  from naming him   said loftus  with  readiness   after  incautiously  saying he was  timid        hear  hear   said all the friends      but to pursue my story  sir   the guns were loaded  and with the  intensity of the heat went off  one after another  and quite riddled one  of his majesty s frigates that was lying in the harbour       that s one of the most difficult riddles to comprehend i ever heard    said moriarty      the frigate answered the riddle with her guns  sir  i promise you       what   exclaimed moriarty   fire on the fort of her own king       there is an honest principle exists among sailors  sir  to return fire  under all circumstances  wherever it comes from  friend or foe  fire  of  which they know the value so well  they won t take from anybody       and what was the consequence   said moriarty      sir  it was the most harmless broadside ever delivered from the ports  of a british frigate  not a single house or human being was injured  the  day was so hot that every sentinel had sunk on the ground in utter  exhaustion  the whole population were asleep  the only loss of  life which occurred was that of a blue macaw  which belonged to the  commandant s daughter       where was the macaw  may i beg to know   said moriarty   cross questioning the colonel in the spirit of a counsel for the defence  on a capital indictment      in the drawing room window  sir       then surely the ball must have done some damage in the house       not the least  sir   said loftus  sipping his wine      surely  colonel   returned moriarty  warming   the ball could not have  killed the macaw without injuring the house       my dear sir   said tom   i did not say the  ball  killed the macaw  i  said the macaw was killed  but  that  was in consequence of a splinter  from an  epaulement  of the south east angle of the fort which the  shot struck and glanced off harmlessly  except for the casualty of the  macaw      moriarty returned a kind of grunt  which implied that  though he could  not further  question   he did not  believe   under such circumstances   taking snuff is a great relief to a man  and  as it happened  moriarty   in taking snuff  could gratify his nose and his vanity at the same time   for he sported a silver gilt snuff box which was presented to him in  some extraordinary way  and bore a grand inscription     on this  piece of plate  being produced  of course it went round the  table  and moriarty could scarcely conceal the satisfaction he felt as  each person read the engraven testimonial of his worth  when it had gone  the circuit of the board  tom loftus put his hand into his pocket and  pulled out the butt end of a rifle  which is always furnished with a  small box  cut out of the solid part of the wood and covered with a  plate of brass acting on a hinge  this box  intended to carry small  implements for the use of the rifleman  to keep his piece in order  was  filled with snuff  and tom said  as he laid it down on the table   this  is  my  snuff box  gentlemen  not as handsome as my gallant friend s at  the opposite side of the table  but extremely interesting to me  it was  previous to one of our dashing affairs in spain that our riflemen were  thrown out in front and on the flanks  the rifles were supported by the  light companies of the regiments in advance  and it was in the latter  duty i was engaged  we had to feel our way through a wood  and had  cleared it of the enemy  when  as we debouched from the wood on the  opposite side  we were charged by an overwhelming force of polish  lancers and cuirassiers  retreat was impossible  resistance almost  hopeless   my lads   said i   we must do something  novel  here  or we  are lost  startle them by fresh practice  the bayonet will no longer  avail you  club your muskets  and hit the horses over the noses  and  they ll smell danger   they took my advice  of course we first delivered  a withering volley  and then to it we went in flail fashion  thrashing  away with the butt ends of our muskets  and sure enough the french were  astonished and driven back in amazement  so tremendous  sir  was the  hitting on our side  that in many instances the butt ends of the muskets  snapped off like tobacco pipes  and the field was quite strewn with them  after the affair  i picked one of them up as a little memento of the  day  and have used it ever since as a snuff box      every one was amused by the outrageous romancing of the colonel but  moriarty  who looked rather disgusted  because he could not edge in a  word of his own at all  he gave up the thing now in despair  for the  colonel had it all his own way  like the bull in a china shop  the more  startling the bouncers he told  the more successful were his anecdotes   and he kept pouring them out with the most astounding rapidity  and  though all voted him the greatest liar they ever met  none suspected he  was not a military man     dick wanted edward o connor  who sat beside him  to sing  but edward  whispered   for heaven s sake don t stop the flow of the lava from that  mighty eruption of lies   he s a perfect vesuvius of mendacity  you ll  never meet his like again  so make the most of him while you have him   pray  sir   said edward to the colonel   have you ever been in any of  the cold climates  i am induced to ask you  from the very wonderful  anecdotes you have told of the hot ones       bless you  sir  i know every corner about the north pole       in which of the expeditions  may i ask  were you engaged   inquired  moriarty      in none of them  sir  we knocked up a  little amateur party   i and a  few curious friends  and certainly we witnessed wonders  you talk here  of a sharp wind  but the wind is so sharp there that it cut off our  beard and whiskers  boreas is a great barber  sir  with his north pole  for a sign  then as for frost   i could tell you such incredible things  of its intensity  our butter  for instance  was as hard as a rock  we  were obliged to knock it off with a chisel and hammer  like a mason at  a piece of granite  and it was necessary to be careful of your eyes at  breakfast  the splinters used to fly about so  indeed  one of the party   did  lose the use of his eye from a butter splinter  but the oddest  thing of all was to watch two men talking to each other  you could  observe the words  as they came out of their mouths  suddenly frozen and  dropping down in little pellets of ice at their feet  so that  after a  long conversation  you might see a man standing up to his knees in his  own eloquence      they all roared with laughter at this last touch of the marvellous  but  loftus preserved his gravity      i don t wonder  gentlemen  at your not receiving that as truth  i told  you it was incredible  in short  that is the reason i have resisted  all temptations to publish  murray  longmans  colburn  bentley  all  the publishers have offered me unlimited terms  but i have always  refused  not that i am a rich man  which makes the temptation of the  thousands i might realise the harder to withstand   t is not that the  gold is not precious to me  but there is something dearer to me  than gold   it is my character for veracity   and therefore  as i am  convinced the public would not believe the wonders i have witnessed   i confine the recital of my adventures to the social circle  but  what profession affords such scope for varied incident as that of the  soldier  change of clime  danger  vicissitude  love  war  privation one  day  profusion the next  darkling dangers  and sparkling joys  zounds   there s nothing like the life of a soldier  and  by the powers  i ll  give you a song in its praise      the proposition was received with cheers  and tom rattled away these  ringing rhymes      the bowld sojer boy       oh there s not a trade that s going    worth showing     or knowing     like that from glory growing              for a bowld sojer boy     where right or left we go     sure you know     friend or foe    will have the hand or toe             from a bowld sojer boy     there s not a town we march thro      but the ladies  looking arch thro     the window panes  will search thro              the ranks to find their joy     while up the street     each girl you meet     will look so sly     will cry     my eye     oh  isn t he a darling  the bowld sojer boy      ii       but when we get the route     how they pout    and they shout    while to the right about             goes the bowld sojer boy     oh   tis then that ladies fair    in despair    tear their hair     but  the divil a one i care               says the bowld sojer boy     for the world is all before us     where the landladies adore us     and ne er refuse to score us              but chalk us up with joy     we taste her tap     we tear her cap        oh  that s the chap    for me      says she      oh  isn t he a darling  the bowld sojer boy      iii        then come along with me     gramachree     and you ll see    how happy you will be             with your bowld sojer boy      faith  if you re up to fun     with me run      t will be done    in the snapping of a gun               says the bowld sojer boy      and  t is then that  without scandal     myself will proudly dandle    the little farthing candle             of our mutual flame  my joy     may his light shine    as bright as mine     till in the line    he ll blaze     and raise    the glory of his corps  like a bowld sojer boy       andy entered the room while the song was in progress  and handed a  letter to dick  which  after the song was over  and he had asked pardon  of his guests  he opened      by jove  you sing right well  colonel   said one of the party      i think the gallant colonel s songs nothing in comparison with his   wonderful  stories   said moriarty      gentlemen   said dick   wonderful as the colonel s recitals have been   this letter conveys a piece of information more surprising than anything  we have heard this day  that stupid fellow who spoiled our champagne has  come in for the inheritance of a large property       what   handy andy   exclaimed those who knew his name      handy andy   said dick   is now a man of fortune            chapter xlviii      it was a note from squire egan which conveyed the news to dick that  caused so much surprise  the details of the case were not even hinted  at  the bare fact alone was mentioned  with a caution to preserve  it still a secret from andy  and appointing an hour for dinner at   morrison s  next day  at which hotel the squire expected to arrive from  the country  with his lady and fanny dawson   en route  for london  till  dinner time  then  the day following  dick was obliged to lay by his  impatience as to the  why and wherefore  of andy s sudden advancement   but  as the morning was to be occupied with tom durfy s wedding  dick  had enough to keep him engaged in the meantime     at the appointed hour a few of tom s particular friends were in  attendance to witness the ceremony  or  to use their own phrase   to see  him turned off   and among them was tom loftus  dick was holding out his  hand to  the colonel   when tom durfy stepped between  and introduced  him under his real name  the masquerading trick of the night before was  laughed at  with an assurance from dick that it only fulfilled all he  had ever heard of the protean powers of a gentleman whom he so much  wished to know  a few minutes  conversation in the recess of a window  put tom loftus and dick the devil on perfectly good terms  and loftus  proposed to dick that they should execute the old established trick on a  bridegroom  of snatching the first kiss from the bride      you must get in tom s way   said loftus   and i ll kiss her       why  the fact is   said dick   i had proposed that pleasure to myself   and  if it s all the same to you   you  can jostle tom  and  i ll  do  the remainder in good style  i promise you       that i can t agree to   said loftus   but as it appears we both have  set our heart on cheating the bridegroom  let us both start fair  and  t  is odd if between us tom durfy is not  done      this was agreed upon  and many minutes did not elapse till the bride  made her appearance  and  hostilities were about to commence   the  mutual enemy of the  high contracting parties  first opened his book   and then his mouth  and in such solemn tones  that it was enough to  frighten  even  a widow  much less a bachelor  as the ceremony verged  to a conclusion  tom loftus and dick the devil edged up towards their   vantage ground on either side of the blooming widow  now nearly  finished into a wife  and stood like greyhounds in the slip  ready to  start after puss  only puss ought to be spelt here with a b   the widow   having been married before  was less nervous than durfy  and  suspecting  the intended game  determined to foil both the brigands  who intended to  rob the bridegroom of his right  so  when the last word of the ceremony  was spoken  and loftus and dick made a simultaneous dart upon her  she  very adroitly ducked  and allowed the two  ruggers and rievers  to rush  into each other s arms  and rub their noses together  while tom durfy  and his blooming bride sealed their contract very agreeably without  their noses getting in each other s way     loftus and dick had only a laugh at  their own  expense  instead of  a kiss at  tom s   upon the failure of their plot  but loftus  in a  whisper to dick  vowed he would execute a trick upon the  pair of them   before the day was over     there was a breakfast as usual  and chicken and tongue and wine  which   taken in the morning  are provocative of eloquence  and  of course  the  proper quantity of healths and toasts were executed  selon la reglei    it was time for the bride and bridegroom to bow and blush and curtsey  out of the room  and make themselves food for a paragraph in the morning  papers  under the title of the  happy pair   who set off in a handsome  chariot   c    c                                                 tom durfy had engaged a pretty cottage in the neighbourhood of clontarf  to pass the honeymoon  tom loftus knew this  and knew  moreover  that  the sitting room looked out on a small lawn which lay before the house   screened by a hedge from the road  but with a circular sweep leading  up to the house  and a gate of ingress and egress at either end of the  hedge  in this sitting room tom  after lunch  was pressing his lady fair  to take a glass of champagne  when the entrance gate was thrown open   and a hackney jaunting car with tom loftus and a friend or two upon  it  driven by a special ragamuffin blowing a tin horn  rolled up the  skimping avenue  and as it scoured past the windows of the sitting room   tom loftus and the other passengers kissed hands to the astonished bride  and bridegroom  and shouted   wish you joy      the thing was so sudden that durfy and the widow  not seeing loftus   could hardly comprehend what it meant  and both ran to the window  but  just as they reached it  up drove another car  freighted with two or  three more wild rascals who followed the lead which had been given them   and as a long train of cars were seen in the distance all driving up  to the avenue  the widow  with a timid little scream  threw her  handkerchief over her face and ran into a corner  tom did not know  whether to laugh or be angry  but  being a good humoured fellow  he  satisfied himself with a few oaths against the incorrigible loftus  and  when the  cortege  had passed  endeavoured to restore the startled fair  one to her serenity                                                 squire egan and party arrived at the appointed hour at their hotel   where dick was waiting to receive them  and  of course  his inquiries  were immediately directed to the extraordinary circumstance of andy s  elevation  the details of which he desired to know  these we shall not  give in the expanded form in which dick heard them  but endeavour  to condense  as much as possible  within the limits to which we are  prescribed     the title of scatterbrain had never been inherited directly from father  to son  it had descended in a zigzag fashion  most appropriate to  the name  nephews and cousins having come in for the coronet and the  property for some generations  the late lord had led a  roue  bachelor  life up to the age of sixty  and then thought it not worth while to  marry  though many mammas and daughters spread their nets and arrayed  their charms to entrap the sexagenarian     the truth was  he had quaffed the cup of licentious pleasure all his  life  after which he thought matrimony would prove insipid  the mere  novelty induces some men  under similar circumstances  to try the holy  estate  but matrimony could not offer to lord scatterbrain the charms of  novelty  for  he had been  once married  though no one but himself was  cognisant of the fact     the reader will certainly say   here s an irish bull  how could a man be  married  without  at least  a woman and a priest being joint possessors  of the secret      listen  gentle reader  and you shall hear how none but lord scatterbrain  knew lord scatterbrain was married     there was nothing at which he ever stopped for the gratification of  his passions  no wealth he would not squander  no deceit he would  not practise  no disguise he would not assume  therefore  gold  and  falsehood  and masquerading were extensively employed by this reckless   roue  in the service of venus  in which service  combined with that of  bacchus  his life was entirely passed     often he assumed the guise of a man in humble life  to approximate some  object of his desire  whom fine clothes and bribery would have instantly  warned and in too many cases his artifices were successful  it was in  one of these adventures he cast his eyes upon the woman hitherto known  in this story under the name of the widow rooney  but all his practices  against her virtue were unavailing  and nothing but a marriage could  accomplish what he had set his fancy upon but even  this  would not stop  him   for he married her      the widow rooney has appeared no very inviting personage through these  pages  and the reader may wonder that a man of rank could proceed to  such desperate lengths upon such slight temptation  but  gentle  reader  she was young and attractive when she was married  never to say   handsome   but good looking decidedly  and with that sort of figure  which is comprehended in the phrase  a fine girl      and has that fine girl altered into the widow rooney  ah  poverty and  hardship are sore trials to the body as well as to the mind  too little  is it considered  while we gaze on aristocratic beauty  how much good  food  soft lying  warm wrapping  ease of mind  have to do with the  attractions which command our admiration  many a hand moulded by  nature to give elegance of form to a kid glove  is  stinted of its fair  proportion  by grubbing toil  the foot which might have excited the  admiration of a ball room  peeping under a flounce of lace in a satin  shoe  and treading the mazy dance   will  grow coarse and broad by  tramping in its native state over toilsome miles  bearing perchance to  a market town some few eggs  whose whole produce would not purchase the  sandal tie of my lady s slipper  will grow red and rough by standing in  wet trenches  and feeling the winter s frost  the neck on which diamonds  might have worthily sparkled  will look less tempting when the biting  winter has hung icicles there for gems  cheeks formed as fresh for  dimpling blushes  eyes as well to sparkle  and lips to smile  as those  which shed their brightness and their witchery in the tapestried saloon   will grow pale with want  and forget their dimples  when smiles are  not there to wake them  lips become compressed and drawn with anxious  thought  and eyes the brightest are quenched of their fires by many  tears     of all these trials poor widow rooney had enough  her husband  after  living with her a month  in the character of a steward to some great man  in a distant part of the country  left her one day for the purpose  of transacting business at a fair  which  he said  would require his  absence for some time  at the end of a week  a letter was sent to her   stating that the make believe steward had robbed his master extensively   and had fled to america  whence he promised to write to her  and send  her means to follow him  requesting  in the meantime  her silence  in  case any inquiry should be made about him  this villanous trick was  played off the more readily  from the fact that a steward had absconded  at the time  and the difference in the name the cruel profligate  accounted for by saying that  as he was hiding at the moment he married  her  he had assumed another name     the poor deserted girl  fully believing this trumped up tale  obeyed  with unflinching fidelity the injunctions of her betrayer  and while  reports were flying abroad of the absconded steward  she never breathed  a word of  what had been confided to her  and accounted for the absence  of  rooney  in various ways of her own  so that all trace of the  profligate was lost  by her remaining inactive in making the smallest  inquiry about him  and her very fidelity to her betrayer became the  means of her losing all power of procuring his discovery  for months she  trusted all was right  but when moon followed moon  and she gave birth  to a boy without hearing one word of his father  misgiving came upon  her  and the only consolation left her was  that  though she was  deserted  and a child left on her hands  still she was  an honest  woman   that child was the hero of our tale  the neighbours passed some  ill natured remarks about her  when it began to be suspected that her  husband would never let her know more about him  for she had been rather  a saucy lady  holding up her nose at poor men  and triumphing in her  catching of the  steward   a man well to do in the world  and it may be  remembered  that this same spirit existed in her when andy s rumoured  marriage with matty gave the prospect of her affairs being retrieved   for she displayed her love of pre eminence to the very first person who  gave her the good news  the ill nature of her neighbours  however  after  the birth of her child and the desertion of her husband  inducing her  to leave the scene of her unmerited wrongs and annoyances  she suddenly  decamped  and  removing to another part of ireland  the poor woman began  a life of hardship  to support herself and rear the offspring of her  unfortunate marriage  in this task she was worthily assisted by one of  her brothers  who pitied her condition  and joined her in her retreat   he married in course of time  and his wife died in giving birth to  oonah  who was soon deprived of her other parent by typhus fever  that  terrible scourge of the poor  so that the praiseworthy desire of the  brother to befriend his sister only involved her  as it happened  in the  deeper difficulty of supporting two children instead of one  this she  did heroically  and the orphan girl rewarded her  by proving a greater  comfort than her own child  for andy had inherited in all its raciness  the blood of the scatterbrains  and his deeds  as recorded in this  history  prove he was no unworthy representative of that illustrious  title  to return to his father  who had done the grievous wrong to the  poor peasant girl  he lived his life of profligacy through  and in  a foreign country died at last  but on his death bed the scourge of  conscience rendered every helpless hour an age of woe  bitterest of all  was the thought of the wife deceived  deserted  and unacknowledged  to  face his last account with such fearful crime upon his head he dared  not  and made all the reparation now in his power  by avowing his  marriage in his last will and testament  and giving all the information  in his power to trace his wife  if living  or his heir  if such existed   he enjoined  by the most sacred injunctions upon him to whom the charge  was committed  that neither cost nor trouble should be spared in the  search  leaving a large sum in ready money besides  to establish the  right  in case his nephew disputed the will  by his own order  his death  was kept secret  and secretly his agent set to work to discover any  trace of the heir  this  in consequence of the woman changing her place  of abode  became more difficult and it was not until after very minute  inquiry that some trace was picked up  and a letter written to the  parish priest of the district to which she had removed  making certain  general inquiries  it was found  on comparing dates some time after   that it was this very letter to father blake which andy had purloined  from the post office  and the squire had thrown into the fire  so that  our hero was very near  by his blundering  destroying his own fortune   luckily for him  however  an untiring and intelligent agent was engaged  in his cause  and a subsequent inquiry  and finally a personal visit to  father blake  cleared the matter up satisfactorily  and the widow was  enabled to produce such proof of her identity  and that of her son  that  handy andy was indisputably lord scatterbrain  and the whole affair was  managed so secretly  that the death of the late lord  and the claim of  title and estates in the name of the rightful heir  were announced at  the same moment  and the  honourable sackville   instead of coming into  possession of the peerage and property  and fighting his adversary at  the great advantage of possession  could only commence a suit to drive  him out  if he sued at all     our limits compel us to this brief sketch of the circumstances through  which handy andy was entitled to and became possessed of a property and  a title  and we must now say something of the effects produced by the  intelligence on the parties most concerned     the honourable sackville scatterbrain  on the advice of high legal  authority  did not attempt to dispute a succession of which such  satisfactory proofs existed  and  fortunately for himself  had knocked  up a watering place match  while he was yet in the bloom of  heirship  presumptive  to a peerage  with the daughter of an english   millionaire      when the widow rooney heard the extraordinary turn affairs had taken   her emotions  after the first few hours of pleasurable surprise  partook  of regret rather than satisfaction  she looked upon her past life of  suffering  and felt as if fate had cheated her  she  a peeress  had  passed her life in poverty and suffering  with contempt from those over  whom she had superior rights  and the few years of the prosperous future  before her offered her poor compensation for the pinching past  but  after such selfish considerations  the maternal feeling came to her  relief  and she rejoiced that  her son  was a lord  but then came the  terrible thought of his marriage to dash her joy and triumph     this was a source of grief to oonah as well   if he wasn t married   she  would say to herself   i might be  lady  scatterbrain   and the tears  would burst through poor oonah s fingers as she held them up to her eyes  and sobbed heavily  till the poor girl would try to gather consolation  from the thought that  maybe  andy s altered circumstances would make   her  disregarded   there would be plenty to have him now   thought she    and he wouldn t think of me  maybe  so  t is well as it is      when andy heard that he was a lord  a real lord  and  after the first  shock of astonishment  could comprehend that wealth and power were in  his possession  he  though the most interested person  never thought   as the two women had done  of the desperate strait in which his marriage  placed him  but broke out into short peals of laughter  and exclaimed  in the intervals   that it was mighty quare   and when  after much  questioning  any intelligible desire he had could be understood  the  first one he clearly expressed was   to have a goold watch       he was made  however  to understand that other things than   goold watches  were of more importance  and the squire  with his  characteristic good nature  endeavoured to open andy s comprehension  to the nature of his altered situation  this  it may be supposed  was  rather a complicated piece of work  and too difficult to be set down  in black and white  the most intelligible portions to andy were his  immediate removal from servitude  and a ready made suit of gentlemanly  apparel  which made andy pay several visits to the looking glass   good natured as the squire was  it would have been equally awkward to  him as to andy for the newly fledged lord  though a lord  to have a seat  at his table  neither could he remain in an inferior position in his  house  so dick  who loved fun  volunteered to take andy under his  especial care to london  and let him share his lodgings  as a bachelor  may do many things which a man surrounded by his family cannot  besides   in a place distant from such extraordinary chances and changes as those  which befell our hero  the sudden and startling difference of position  of the parties not being known renders it possible for a gentleman to  do the good natured thing which dick undertook  without compromising  himself  in dublin it would not have done for dick dawson to allow the  man who would have held his horse the day before  to share the same  board with him merely because fortune had played one of her frolics and  made andy a lord  but in london the case was different     to london therefore they proceeded  the incidents of the journey   sea sickness included  which so astonished the new traveller  we pass  over  as well as the numberless mistakes in the great metropolis  which  afforded dick plentiful amusement  though  in truth  dick had better  objects in view than laughing at andy s embarrassments in his new  position  he really wished to help him in the difficult path into which  the new lord had been thrust  and did this in a merry sort of way more  successfully than by serious drilling  it was hard to break andy of  the habit of saying  misther dick   when addressing him  but  at last    misther dawson  was established  eating with his knife  drinking as  loudly as a horse  and other like accomplishments  were not so easily  got under  yet it was wonderful how much he improved  as his shyness  grew less  and his consciousness of being a lord grew stronger     but  if the good nature of dick had not prompted him to take andy into  training  the newly discovered nobleman would not have long been in  want of society  it was wonderful how many persons were eager to show  civility to his lordship  and some amongst them even went so far as to  discover relationship  plenty were soon ready to take lord scatterbrain  here  and escort him there  accompany him to exhibitions and  other public places  and charmed all the time with his lordship s  remarks   they were so original    quite delightful to meet something  so fresh    how remarkably clever the irish were   such were among the  observations his ignorant blunders produced  and he who  as handy andy   had been anathematised all his life as a  stupid rascal    a  blundering thief    a thick headed brute    c   under the title of  lord scatterbrain all of a sudden was voted  vastly amusing  a little  eccentric  perhaps  but  so  droll  in fact  so witty   this was all  very delightful for andy  so delightful that he quite forgot bridget   rhua   but that lady did not leave him long in his happy obliviousness   one day  while dick was absent  and andy rocking on a chair before  the fire  twirling the massive gold chain of his gold watch round his  forefinger  and uncoiling it again  his repose was suddenly disturbed  by the appearance of bridget herself  accompanied by  shan more  and a  shrimp of a man in rusty black  who turned out to be a shabby attorney  who advanced money to convey his lady client and her brother to london   for the purpose of making a dash at the lord at once  and securing a  handsome sum by a  coup de main      andy  though taken by surprise  was resolute  bitter words were  exchanged  and as they seemed likely to lead to blows  andy prudently  laid hold of the poker  and  in language not quite suited to a noble  lord  swore he would see what the inside of  shan more s  head was made  of  if he attempted to advance upon him  bridget screamed and  scolded  while the attorney endeavoured to keep the peace  and  beyond  everything  urged lord scatterbrain to enter at once into written  engagements for a handsome settlement upon his  lady       lady   exclaimed andy   oh   a pretty  lady  she is       i m as good a lady as you are a lord  anyhow   cried bridget      altercation will do no good  my lord and my lady   said the attorney    let me suggest the propriety of your writing an engagement at once    and the little man pushed pen  ink  and paper towards andy      i can t  i tell you   cried andy      you must   roared  shan more       bad luck to you  how can i when i never larned       your lordship can make your mark   said the attorney       faith i can  with a poker   cried andy   and you d better take care   master parchment  make my mark  indeed   do you think i d disgrace  the house o  peers by lettin  on that a lord couldn t write   quit the  buildin   i tell you      in the midst of the row  which now rose to a tremendous pitch  dick  returned  and after a severe reprimand to the pettifogger for his  sinister attempt on andy  referred him to lord scatterbrain s solicitor   it was not such an easy matter to silence bridget  who extended her  claws towards her lord and master in a very menacing manner  calling  down bitter imprecations on her own head if she wouldn t have her  rights     every now and then between the bursts of the storm andy would exclaim    get out       my lord   said dick   remember your dignity       av coorse   said andy   but still she must get out      the house was at last cleared of the uproarious party  but though  andy got rid of their presence  they left their sting behind  lord  scatterbrain felt  for the first time  that a lord can be very unhappy     dick hurried him away at once to the chambers of the law agent  but he   being closeted on some very important business with another client on  their arrival  returned an answer to their application for a conference   which they forwarded through the double doors of this sanctum by a  hard looking man with a pen behind his ear  that he could not have the  pleasure of seeing them till the next morning  lord scatterbrain passed  a more unhappy night than he had ever done in his life  even than that  when he was tied up to the old tree  croaked at by ravens  and the  despised of rats     negotiations were opened the next day between the pettifogger on  bridget s side and the law agent of the noble lord  and the arguments    pro and con    lay thus     in the first place  the opening declaration was  lord scatterbrain never  would live with the aforesaid bridget     answered  that nevertheless  as she was his lawful wife  a provision  suitable to her rank must be made     they  the claimants  were asked to name a sum     the sum was considered exorbitant  it being argued that when her  husband had determined never to live with her  he was in a far  different condition  therefore it was unfair to seek so large a separate  maintenance now     the pettifogger threatened that lady scatterbrain would run in debt   which lord scatterbrain must discharge  my lord s agent suggested  that my lady would be advertised in the public papers  and the public  cautioned against giving her credit     a sum could not be agreed upon  though a fair one was offered on andy s  part  for the greediness of the pettifogger  who was to have a share of  the plunder  made him hold out for more  and negotiations were broken  off for some days     poor andy was in a wretched state of vexation  it was bad enough that  he was married to this abominable woman  without an additional plague of  being persecuted by her  to such an amount this rose at last  that she  and her big brother dodged him every time he left the house  so that  in self defence he was obliged to become a close prisoner in his own  lodgings  all this at last became so intolerable to the captive  that  he urged a speedy settlement of the vexatious question  and a larger  separate maintenance was granted to the detestable woman than would  otherwise have been ceded  the only stipulation of a stringent nature  made being  that lord scatterbrain should be free from the persecutions  of his hateful wife for the future           chapter xlix      squire egan  with his lady and fanny dawson  had now arrived in london   murtough murphy  too  had joined them  his services being requisite in  working the petition against the return of the sitting member for the  county  this had so much promise of success about it  that the opposite  party  who had the sheriff for the county in their interest  bethought  of a novel expedient to frustrate the petition when a reference to the  poll was required     they declared the principal poll book was lost     this seemed not very satisfactory to one side of the committee  and the  question was asked   how could it be lost   the answer was one which  irish contrivance alone could have invented    it fell into a pot of  broth  and the dog ate it     footnote  if not this identical answer   something like it was given on a disputed irish election  before a  committee of the house of commons      this protracted the contest for some time  but eventually  in spite of  the dog s devouring knowledge so greedily  the squire was declared duly  elected and took the oaths and his seat for the county     it was hard on sackville scatterbrain to lose his seat in the house and  a peerage  nearly at once  but the latter loss threw the former so far  into the shade  that he scarcely felt it  besides  he could  console himself with having buttered his crumbs pretty well in the  marriage market  and  with a rich wife  retired from senatorial drudgery  to private repose  which was much more congenial to his easy temper     but while the squire s happy family circle was rejoicing in his  triumph  while he was invited to the speaker s dinners  and the ladies  were looking forward to tickets for  the lantern   their pleasure was  suddenly dashed by fatal news from ireland     a serious accident had befallen major dawson  so serious  that his life  was despaired of  and an immediate return to ireland by all who were  interested in his life was the consequence     though the suddenness of this painful event shocked his family  the  act which caused it did not surprise them  for it was one against which  major dawson had been repeatedly cautioned  involving a danger he had  been affectionately requested not to tempt  but the habitual obstinacy  of his nature prevailed  and he persisted in doing that which his  son  and his daughters  and friends  prophesied  would  kill him some  time or other  and  did   at last  the major had three little iron guns   mounted on carriages  on a terrace in front of his house  and it was his  wont to fire a salute on certain festival days from these guns  which   from age and exposure to the weather  became dangerous to use  it was in  vain that this danger was represented to him  he would reply  with his  accustomed  pooh  pooh  i have been firing these guns for forty years   and they won t do me any harm now      this was the prime fault of the major s character  time and  circumstances were never taken into account by him  what was done once   might be done  always    ought  to be done always  the bare thought of  change of any sort  to him  was unbearable  and whether it was a rotten  old law or a rotten old gun  he would charge both up to the muzzle and  fire away  regardless of consequences  the result was  that on a certain  festival his  favourite  gun burst in discharging  and the last mortal  act of which the major was conscious  was that of putting the port fire  to the touchhole  for a heavy splinter of iron struck him on the head   and though he lived for some days afterwards  he was insensible  before  his children arrived he was no more  and the only duty left them to  perform was the melancholy one of ordering his funeral     the obsequies of the old major were honoured by a large and  distinguished attendance from all parts of the country  and amongst  those who bore the pall was edward o connor  who had the melancholy  gratification of testifying his respect beside the grave of fanny s  father  though the severe old man had banished him from his presence  during his lifetime     but now all obstacle to the union of edward and fanny was removed  and  after the lapse of a few days had softened the bitter grief which this  sudden bereavement of her father had produced  edward received a note  from dick  inviting him to the manor house  where  all  would be glad to  see him     in a few minutes after the receipt of that note edward was in his  saddle  and swiftly leaving the miles behind him till  from the top of  a rising ground  the roof of the manor house appeared above the trees  in which it was embosomed  he had not till then slackened his speed  but  now drawing rein  he proceeded at a slower pace towards the house he had  not entered for some years  and the sight of which awakened such varied  emotions     to return after long years of painful absence to some place which has  been the scene of our former joys  and whence the force of circumstance   and not choice  has driven us  is oppressive to the heart  there is a  mixed sense of regret and rejoicing  which struggle for predominance   we rejoice that our term of exile has expired  but we regret the years  which that exile has deducted from the brief amount of human life  never  to be recalled  and therefore as so much  lost  to us  we think of the  wrong or the caprice of which we have been the victims  and thoughts  will stray across the most confiding heart  if friends shall meet as  fondly as they parted  or if time  while impressing deeper marks upon  the  outward  form  may have obliterated some impressions  within   who  has returned after years of absence  however assured of the unflinching  fidelity of the love he left behind  without saying to himself  in the  pardonable yearning of affection   shall i meet smiles as bright as  those that used to welcome me  shall i be pressed as fondly within the  arms whose encompassment were to me the pale of all earthly enjoyment      such thoughts crowded on edward as he approached the house  there was  not a lane  or tree  or hedge  by the way  that had not for him  its association  he reached the avenue gate  as he flung it open he  remembered the last time he passed it  fanny had then leaned on his  arm  he felt himself so much excited  that  instead of riding up to the  house  he took the private path to the stables  and throwing down the  reins to a boy  he turned into a shrubbery and endeavoured to recover  his self command before he should present himself  as he emerged from  the sheltered path and turned into a walk which led to the garden  a  small conservatory was opened to his view  awaking fresh sensations   it was in that very place he had first ventured to declare his love to  fanny  there she heard and frowned not  there  where nature s choicest  sweets were exhaling  he had first pressed her to his heart  and thought  the balmy sweetness of her lips beyond them all  he hurried forward in  the enthusiasm the recollection recalled  to enter that spot consecrated  in his memory  but on arriving at the door  he suddenly stopped  for he  saw fanny within  she was plucking a geranium  the flower she had been  plucking some years before  when edward said he loved her  she  all that  morning  had been under the influence of feelings similar to edward s   had felt the same yearnings  the same tender doubts  the same fond  solicitude that he should be the same edward from whom she parted   but she thought of  more  than this  with the exquisitely delicate  contrivance belonging to woman s nature  she wished to give him a signal  of her fond recollection  and was plucking the flower she gathered  when he declared his love  to place on her bosom when they should meet   edward felt the meaning of her action  as the graceful hand broke the  flower from its stem  he would have rushed towards her at once  but that  the deep mourning in which she was arrayed seemed to command a gentler  approach  for grief commands respect  he advanced softly  she heard a  gentle step behind her  turned  uttered a faint exclamation of joy  and  sank into his arms  in a few moments she recovered her consciousness   and opening her sweet eyes upon him  breathed softly   dear  edward    and the lips which  in two words  had expressed so much   were impressed with a fervent kiss in the blessed consciousness of  possession  on that very spot where the first timid and doubting word of  love had been spoken     in that moment he was rewarded for all his years of absence and anxiety   his heart was satisfied  he felt he was dear as ever to the woman he  idolised  and the short and hurried beating of  both  their hearts told  more than words could express  words   what were words to them   thought  was too swift for their use  and feeling too strong for their utterance   but they drank from each other s eyes large draughts of delight  and   in the silent pressure of each other s welcoming embrace  felt how truly  they loved each other     he led her gently from the conservatory  and they exchanged words of  affection  soft and low   as they sauntered through the wooded path  which surrounded the house  that live long day they wandered up and down  together  repeating again and again the anxious yearnings which occupied  their years of separation  yet asking each other was not all more than  repaid by the gladness of the present       yet  how  painful has been the past   exclaimed edward      but  now    said fanny  with a gentle pressure of her tiny hand on  edward s arm  and looking up to him with her bright eyes   but  now        true  darling   he cried    tis ungrateful to think of the past while  enjoying such a present and with such a future before me  bless that  cheerful heart  and those hope inspiring glances  oh  fanny  in the  wilderness of life there are springs and palm trees  you are both to  me  and heaven has set its own mark upon you in those laughing blue eyes  which might set despair at defiance       poetical as ever  edward   said fanny  laughing      sit down  dearest  for a moment  on this old tree  beside me   tis not  the first time i have strung rhymes in your presence and your praise    he took a small note book from his pocket  and fanny looked on smilingly  as edward s pencil rapidly ran over the leaf and traced the lover s  tribute to his mistress     the sunshine in you    i       it is sweet when we look round the wide world s waste      to know that the desert bestows    the palms where the weary heart may rest       the spring that in purity flows         and where have i found        in this wilderness round      that spring and that shelter so true         unfailing in need         and my own  indeed         oh  dearest  i ve found it in you     ii       and  oh when the cloud of some darkening hour      o ershadows the soul with its gloom     then where is the light of the vestal pow r       the lamp of pale hope to illume         oh  the light ever lies        in those bright fond eyes       where heaven has impressed its own blue        as a seal from the skies        as my heart relies      on that gift of its sunshine in you      fanny liked the lines  of course   dearest   she said   may i always  prove sunshine to you  is it not a strange coincidence that these lines  exactly fit a little air which occurred to me some time ago        tis odd   said edward   sing it to me  darling      fanny took the verses from his hand  and sung them to her own measure   oh  happy triumph of the poet   to hear his verses wedded to sweet  sounds  and warbled by the woman he loves  edward caught up the strain   adding his voice to hers in harmony  and thus they sauntered homewards   trolling their ready made duet together  there were not two happier  hearts in the world that day than those of fanny dawson and edward  o connor           chapter l      respect for the memory of major dawson of course prevented the immediate  marriage of edward and fanny  but the winter months passed cheerfully  away in looking forward to the following autumn which should witness  the completion of their happiness  though edward was thus tempted by  the society of the one he loved best in the world  it did not make him  neglect the duties he had undertaken in behalf of gustavus  not only did  he prosecute his reading with him regularly  but he took no small pains  in looking after the involved affairs of the family  and strove to make  satisfactory arrangements with those whose claims were gnawing away the  estate to nothing  though the years of gusty s minority were but few   still they would give the estate some breathing time  and creditors   seeing the minor backed by a man of character  and convinced a sincere  desire existed to relieve the estate of its encumbrances and pay all  just claims  presented a less threatening front than hitherto  and  listened readily to such terms of accommodation as were proposed  to them  uncle robert  for the breaking of whose neck ratty s pious  aspirations had been raised  behaved very well on the occasion  a loan  from him  and a partial sale of some of the acres  stopped the mouths  of the greedy wolves who fatten on men s ruin  and time and economy were  looked forward to for the discharge of all other debts  uncle robert   having so far acted the friend  was considered entitled to have a  partial voice in the ordering of things at the hall  and having a notion  that an english accent was genteel  he desired that gusty and ratty  should pass a year under the roof of a clergyman in england  who  received a limited number of young gentlemen for the completion of  their education  gustavus would much rather have remained near edward  o connor  who had already done so much for him  but edward  though  he regretted parting with gustavus  recommended him to accede to  his uncle s wishes  though he did not see the necessity of an irish  gentleman being ashamed of his accent     the visit to england  however  was postponed till the spring  and the  winter months were used by gustavus in availing himself as much as he  could of edward s assistance in putting him through his classics   his pride prompting him to present himself creditably to the english  clergyman     it was in vain to plead  such  pride to ratty  who paid more attention  to shooting than his lessons  his mother strove to persuade  ratty  was deaf  his  gran  strove to bribe  ratty was incorruptible  gusty  argued  ratty answered after his own fashion      why won t you learn even a little       i m to go to that  english fellow  in spring  and i shall have no fun  then  so i m making good use of my time now       do you call it  good use  to be so dreadfully idle and shamefully  ignorant       bother   the less i know  the more the english fellow will have to  teach me  and uncle bob will have more worth for his money   and then  ratty would whistle a jig  fling a fowling piece over his shoulder   and shout  ponto  ponto  ponto   as he traversed the stable yard  the  delighted pointer would come bounding at the call  and  after circling  round his young master with agile grace and yelps of glee at the sight  of the gun  dash forward to the well known  bottoms  in eager expectancy  of ducks and snipe  how fared it all this time with the lord of  scatterbrain  he became established  for the present  in a house that  had been a long time to let in the neighbourhood  and his mother was  placed at the head of it  and oonah still remained under his protection   though the daily sight of the girl added to andy s grief at the  desperate plight in which his ill starred marriage placed him  to say  nothing of the constant annoyance of his mother s growling at him for  his making  such a judy of himself   for the dowager lady scatterbrain  could not get rid of her vocabulary at once  andy s only resource under  these circumstances was to mount his horse and fly     as for the dowager lady scatterbrain  she had a carriage with  a  picture  on it  as she called the coat of arms  and was fond of driving  past the houses of people who had been uncivil to her  against mrs   casey  the renowned matty dwyer  she entertained an especial spite  in  consideration of her treatment of her beautiful boy and her own pair  of black eyes  so she determined to  pay her off  in her own way  and  stopping one day at the hole in the hedge which served for entrance to  the estate of the  three cornered field   she sent the footman in to say  the  dowjer  lady scatter breen  wanted to speak with  casey s wife      when the servant  according to instructions  delivered this message  he  was sent back with the answer   that if any lady wanted to see casey s  wife   casey s wife   was at home       oh  go back  and tell the poor woman i don t want to bring her to the  door of my carriage  if it s inconvaynient  i only wished to give her  a little help  and tell her if she sends up eggs to the big house  lady  scatterbreen will pay her for them      when the servant delivered this message  matty grew outrageous at the  means  my lady  took of crowing over her  and rushing to the door  with  her face flushed with rage  roared out   tell the old baggage i want  none of her custom  let her lay eggs for herself      the servant staggered back in amaze  and matty  feeling he would not  deliver her message  ran to the hole in the hedge and repeated her  answer to my lady herself  with a great deal more which need not be  recorded  suffice it to say  my lady thought it necessary to pull up the  glass  against which matty threw a handful of mud  the servant jumped up  on his perch behind the carriage  which was rapidly driven away by the  coachman  but not so fast that matty could not  by dint of running  keep  it  within range  for some seconds  during which time she contrived to  pelt both coachman and footman with mud  and leave her mark on their  new livery  this was a salutary warning to the old woman  who was more  cautious in her demonstrations of grandeur for the future  if she was  stinted in the enjoyment of her new born dignity abroad  she could  indulge it at home without let or hindrance  and to this end asked andy  to let her have a hundred pounds  in one pound notes  for a particular  purpose  what this purpose was no one was told or could guess  but for  a good while after she used to be closeted by herself for several hours  during the day     andy had his hours of retirement also  for with praiseworthy industry he  strove hard  poor fellow  to lift himself above the state of ignorance   and had daily attendance from the parish schoolmaster  the mysteries of   pothooks and hangers  and abc weighed heavily on the nobleman s mind   which must have sunk under the burden of scholarship and penmanship   but for the other  ship   the horsemanship  which was andy s daily  self established reward for his perseverance in his lessons  besides he  really  could  ride  and as it was the only accomplishment of which he  was master  it was no wonder he enjoyed the display of it  and  to say  the truth  he did  and that on a first rate horse too  having appointed  murtough murphy his law agent  he often rode over to the town to talk  with him  and as murtough could have some fun and thirteen and fourpence  also per visit  he was always glad to see his  noble friend   the high  road did not suit andy s notion of things  he preferred the variety   shortness  and diversion of going across the country on these occasions   and in one of these excursions  in the most secluded portion of his  ride  which unavoidably lay through some quarries and deep broken  ground  he met  ragged nance   who held up her finger as he approached  the gorge of this lonely dell  in token that she would speak with him   andy pulled up      long life to you  my lord   said nance  dropping a deep curtsey   and  sure i always liked you since the night you was so bowld for the sake  of the poor girl  the young lady  i mane  now  god bless her  and i just  wish to tell you  my lord  that i think you might as well not be going  these lonely ways  for i see  them  hanging about here betimes  that  maybe it would not be good for your health to meet  and sure  my lord   it would be a hard case if you were killed now  havin  the luck of the  sick calf that lived all the winther and died in the summer       is it that big blackguard   shan more   you mane   said andy      no less   said nance  growing deadly pale as she cast a piercing  glance into the dell  and cried  in a low  hurried tone   talk of the  divil  and there he is  i see him peep out from behind a rock       he s running this way   said andy      then you run the other way   said nance   look there  i see him strive  to hide a blunderbuss under his coat  gallop off  for the love o  god   or there ll be murther       maybe there will be that same   said andy   if i leave you here  and  he suspects you gave me the hard word    footnote   hard word  implies a  caution       never mind me   said nance   save yourself  see  he s moving fast   he ll be near enough to you soon to fire       get up behind me   said andy   i won t leave you here       run  i tell you       i won t       god bless you  then   said the woman  as andy held out his hand and  gripped hers firmly      put your foot on mine   said andy     the woman obeyed  and was soon seated behind our hero  gripping him fast  by the waist  while he pushed his horse to a fast canter      hold hard now   said andy   for there s a stiff jump here   as he  approached the ditch of which he spoke  two men sprang up from it  and  one fired  as andy cleared the leap in good style  nance holding on  gallantly  the horse was not many strokes on the opposite side  when  another shot was fired in their rear  followed by a scream from  the woman  to andy s inquiry  if she was  kilt   she replied in the  negative  but said  they hurt her sore   and she was  bleeding a power    but that she could still hold on  however  and urged him to speed  the  clearance of one or two more leaps gave her grievous pain  but a large  common soon opened before them  which was skirted by a road leading  directly to a farm house  where andy left the wounded woman  and then  galloped off for medical aid  this soon arrived  and the wound was found  not to be dangerous  though painful  the bullet had struck and pierced  a tin vessel of a bottle form  in which nance carried the liquid  gratuities of the charitable  and this not only deadened the force of  the ball  but glanced it also  and the escapement of the butter milk   which the vessel contained  nance had mistaken for the effusion of her  own blood  it was a clear case  however  that if nance had not been  sitting behind andy  lord scatterbrain would have been a dead man  so  that his gratitude and gallantry towards the poor beggar woman proved  the means of preserving his own life           chapter li      the news of the attack on lord scatterbrain ran over the country like  wildfire  and his conduct throughout the affair raised his character  wonderfully in the opinion of all classes  many who had hitherto held  aloof from the mushroom lord  came forward to recognise the manly  fellow  and cards were left at  the big house   which were never seen  there before  the magistrates were active in the affair  and a reward  was immediately offered for the apprehension of the offenders  but  before any active steps could be taken by the authorities  andy   immediately after the attack  collected a few stout fellows himself  and  knowing where the den of shan and his miscreants lay  he set off at the  head of his party to try if he could not secure them himself  but before  he did this  he despatched a vehicle to the farmhouse  where poor nance  lay wounded  with orders that she should be removed to his own house   the doctor having said that the transit would not be injurious     a short time served to bring andy and his followers to the private  still  where a little looking about enabled them to discover the  entrance  which was covered by some large stones  and a bunch of furze  placed as a mask to the opening  it was clear that it was impossible for  any persons inside to have thus covered the entrance  and it suggested  the possibility that some of its usual inmates were then absent   nevertheless  having such desperate characters to deal with  it was a  service of danger to be leader in the descent to the cavern when the  opening was cleared  but andy was the first to enter  which he did  boldly  only desiring his attendants to follow him quickly  and give him  support in case of resistance  a lantern had been provided  andy knowing  the darkness of the den  and the party was thereby enabled to explore  with celerity and certainty the hidden haunt of the desperadoes  the  ashes of the fire were yet warm  but no one was to be seen  till andy   drawing the screen of the bed  discovered a man lying in a seemingly  helpless state  breathing with difficulty  and the straw about him  dabbled with blood  on attempting to lift him  the wretch groaned  heavily and muttered   d  n you  let me alone  you ve done for me  i m  dying      the man was gently carried from the cave to the open air  which seemed  slightly to revive him  his eyes opened heavily  but closed again  yet  still he breathed  his wounds were staunched as well as the limited  means and knowledge of the parties present allowed  and the ladder   drawn up from the cave and overlaid with tufts of heather  served to  bear the sufferer to the nearest house  whence andy ordered a mounted  messenger to hurry for a doctor  the man seemed to hear what was going  forward  for he faintly muttered   the priest  the priest      andy  anxious to procure this most essential comfort to the dying man   went himself in search of father blake  whom he found at home  and who  suggested that a magistrate might be also useful upon the occasion  and  as merryvale lay not much out of the way  andy made a detour to obtain  the presence of squire egan  while father blake pushed directly onward  upon his ghostly mission     andy and the squire arrived soon after the priest had administered  spiritual comfort to the sufferer  who still retained sufficient  strength to make his depositions before the squire  the purport of which  turned out to be of the utmost importance to andy     this man  it appeared   was the husband of bridget   who had returned  from transportation  and sought his wife and her dear brother  and his  former lawless associates  on reaching ireland  on finding bridget  had married again  his anger at her infidelity was endeavoured to be  appeased by the representations made to him that it was a  good job    inasmuch as  the lord  had been screwed out of a good sum of money by  way of separate maintenance  and that he would share the advantage of  that  when matters were more explained  however  and the convict found  this money was divided among so many  who all claimed right of share  in the plunder  his discontent returned  in the first place  the  pettifogger made a large haul for his services  shan more swore it was  hard if a woman s own brother was not to be the better for her luck  and  larry hogan claimed hush money  for he could prove bridget s marriage   and so upset their scheme of plunder  the convict maintained his claim  as husband was stronger than any  but this  all the others declared  was  an outlandish notion he brought back with him from foreign parts  and  did not prevail in their code of laws by any manner o  means  and even  went so far as to say they thought it hard  after they had  done the  job   that he was to come in and lessen their profit  which he would  as  they were willing to give an even share of the spoil  and after that   he must be the most discontented villain in the world if he was not  pleased     the convict feigned contentment  but meditated at once revenge against  his wife and the gang  and separate profit for himself  he thought he  might stipulate for a good round sum from lord scatterbrain  as he could  prove him free of his supposed matrimonial engagement  and inwardly  resolved he would soon pay a visit to his lordship  but his intentions  were suspected by the gang  and a strict watch kept upon him  and though  his dissimulation and contrivance were of no inferior order  larry hogan  was his overmatch  and the convict was detected in having been so near  lord scatterbrain s dwelling  that they feared their secret  if not  already revealed  was no longer to be trusted to their new confederate s  keeping  and it was deemed advisable to knock him on the head  and shoot  my lord  which they thought would prevent all chance of the invalidity  of the marriage being discovered  and secure the future payment of the  maintenance     how promptly the murderous determination was acted upon  the preceding  events prove  andy s courage in the first part of the affair saved his  life  his promptness in afterwards seeking to secure the offenders  led to the important discovery he had just made  and as the convict s  depositions could be satisfactorily backed by proofs which he showed the  means of obtaining  andy was congratulated heartily by the squire and  father blake  and rode home in almost delirious delight at the prospect  of making oonah his wife  on reaching the stables  he threw himself from  his saddle  let the horse make his own way to his stall  dashed through  the back hall  and nearly broke his neck in tumbling up stairs  burst  open the drawing room door  and made a rush upon oonah  whom he hugged  and kissed most outrageously  amidst exclamations of the wildest  affection     oonah  half strangled and struggling for breath  at last freed herself  from his embraces  and asked him  angrily  what he was about  in which  inquiry she was backed by his mother     andy answered by capering round the room  shouting   hurroo  i m not  married at all  hurroo   he turned over the chairs  upset the tables   threw the mantelpiece ornaments into the fire  seized the poker and  tongs  and banged them together as he continued dancing and shouting     oonah and his mother stood gazing at his antics in trembling amazement   till at last the old woman exclaimed   holy vargin  he s gone mad    whereupon she and her niece set up a violent screaming  which called  andy back to his propriety  and  as well as his excitement would permit   he told them the cause of his extravagant joy  his wonder and delight  were shared by his mother and the blushing oonah  who did not struggle  so hard in andy s embrace on his making a second vehement demonstration  of his love for her      let me send for father blake  my jewel   said andy   and i ll marry you  at once      his mother reminded him he must first have his present marriage proved  invalid  andy uttered several pieces of  original  eloquence on  the  law s delay       well  anyhow   said he   i ll drink your health  my darling girl  this  day  as lady scatterbrain  for you must consider yourself as sitch       behave yourself  my lord   said oonah  archly      bother   cried andy  snatching another kiss      hillo   cried dick dawson  entering at the moment  and seeing the  romping match   you re losing no time  i see  andy      oonah was running from the room  laughing and blushing  when dick  interposed  and cried   ah  don t go   my lady   that  is to be       oonah slapped down the hand that barred her progress  exclaiming    you re just as bad as he is  mister dawson   and ran away     dick had ridden over  on hearing the news  to congratulate andy  and  consented to remain and dine with him  oonah had rather  after what  had taken place  he had not been there  for dick backed andy in his  tormenting the girl and joined heartily in drinking to andy s toast   which  according to promise  he gave to the health of the future lady  scatterbrain     it was impossible to repress andy s wild delight  and in the excitement  of the hour he tossed off bumper after bumper to all sorts of  love making toasts  till he was quite overcome by his potations  and  fit for no place but bed  to this last retreat of  the glorious  he was  requested to retire  and  after much coaxing  consented  he staggered  over to the window curtain  which he mistook for that of the bed  in  vain they wanted to lead him elsewhere  he would sleep in no other bed  but  that   and  backing out at the window pane  he made a smash  of  which he seemed sensible  for he said it wasn t a fair trick to put  pins in the bed   i know it was oonah did that   hip   ha  ha  lady  scatterbrain   never mind  hip   i ll have my revenge on you yet      they could not get him up stairs  so his mother suggested he should  sleep in her room  which was on the same floor  for that night  and at  last he was got into the apartment  there he was assisted to disrobe  as  he stood swaying about at a dressing table  chancing to lay his hands on  a pill box  he mistook it for his watch      stop  stop   he stammered forth   i must wind my watch   and  suiting  the action to the word  he began twisting about the pill box  the lid  of which came off and the pills fell about the floor   oh  murder    said lord scatterbrain   the works of my watch are fallin  about the  flure  pick them up  pick them up  pick them up    he could speak  no more  and becoming quite incapable of all voluntary action  was  undressed and put to bed  the last sound which escaped him being a faint  muttering   pick them up            chapter the last      the day following the eventful one just recorded  the miserable convict  breathed his last  a printed notice was posted in all the adjacent  villages  offering a reward for the apprehension of  shan more  and   other persons unknown   for their murderous assault  and a small  reward was promised for such  private information as might lead to  the apprehension of the aforesaid    c    c  larry hogan at once came  forward and put the authorities on the scent  but still shan and his  accomplices remained undiscovered  larry s information on another  subject  however  was more effective  he gave his own testimony to the  previous marriage of bridget  and pointed out the means of obtaining  more  so that  ere long  lord scatterbrain was a  free man   though the  depositions of the murdered man did not directly implicate larry in the  murderous attack  still it showed that he had participated in much  of their villany  but  as in difficult cases  we must put up with bad  instruments to reach the ends of justice  so this rascal was useful for  his evidence and private information  and got his reward     but he got his reward in more ways than one  he knew that he dare not  longer remain in the country after what had taken place  and set off  directly for dublin by the mail  intending to proceed to england  but  england he never reached  as he was proceeding down the custom house  quay in the dusk of the evening  to get on ship board  his arms were  suddenly seized and drawn behind him by a powerful grasp  while a woman  in front drew a handkerchief across his mouth  and stifled his attempted  cries  his bundle was dragged from him  and the woman ransacked his  pockets but they contained but a few shillings  larry having hidden  the wages of his treachery to his confederates in the folds of his  neck cloth  to pluck this from his throat  many a fierce wrench was made  by the woman  when her attempts on the pockets proved worthless  but the  handkerchief was knotted so tightly that she could not disengage it   the approach of some passengers along the quay alarmed the assailants  of larry  who  ere the iron grip released him  heard a deep curse in  his ear growled by a voice he well knew  and then he felt himself hurled  with gigantic force from the quay wall  before the base  cheating   faithless scoundrel could make one exclamation  he was plunged into  the liffey  even before one mental aspiration for mercy  he was in  the throes of suffocation  the heavy splash in the water caught the  attention of those whose approach had alarmed the murderers  and seeing  a man and woman running  a pursuit commenced  which ended by newgate  having two fresh tenants the next day     and so farewell to the entire of the abominable crew  whose evil doings  and merited fates have only been recorded when it became necessary  to our story  it is better to leave the debased and the profligate in  oblivion than drag their doings before the day  and it is with happy  consciousness an irishman may assert  that there is plenty of subject  afforded by irish character and irish life honourable to the land   pleasing to the narrator  and sufficiently attractive to the reader   without the unwholesome exaggerations of crime which too often disfigure  the fictions which pass under the title of  irish   alike offensive  to truth as to taste  alike injurious both for private and public  considerations                                                 it was in the following autumn that a particular chariot drove up to the  door of the victoria hotel  on the shore of killarney lake  a young man  of elegant bearing handed a very charming young lady from the chariot   aand that kindest and mos accommodating of hostesses  mrs  f       welcomed the fresh arrival with her good humoured and smiling face     why  amidst the crowd of arrivals at the victoria  one chariot should  be remarkable beyond another  arose from its quiet elegance  which might  strike even a casual observer  but the intelligent mrs  f     saw with  half an eye the owners must be high bred people  to the apartments  already engaged for them they were shown  but few minutes were lost  within doors where such matchless natural beauty tempted them without   a boat was immediately ordered  and then the newly arrived visitors were  soon on the lake  the boatmen had already worked hard that day  having  pulled one party completely round the lakes  no trifling task  but the  hardy fellows again bent to their oars  and made the sleeping waters  wake in golden flashes to the sunset  till told they need not pull so  hard      faith  then  we ll  plaze  you  sir   said the stroke oarsman  with a  grin   for we have had quite enough of it to day       do you not think  fanny   said edward o connor  for it was he who spoke  to his bride   do you not think  tis more in unison with the tranquil  hour and the coming shadows  to glide softly over the lulled waters       yes   she replied   it seems almost sacrilege to disturb this heavenly  repose by the slightest dip of the oar  see how perfectly that lovely  island is reflected       that is innisfallin  my lady   said the boatman  hearing her allude  to the island   where the hermitage is   as he spoke  a gleam of light  sparkled on the island  which was reflected on the water      one might think the hermit was there too   said fanny   and had just  lighted a lamp for his vigils       that s the light of the guide that shows the place to the quality  my  lady  and lives on the island always in a corner of the ould ruin   and  indeed  if you d like to see the island this evening  there s time  enough  and  twould be so much saved out of to morrow      the boatman s advice was acted upon  and as they glided towards the  island  fanny and edward gazed delightedly on the towering summits of  magillicuddy s reeks  whose spiral pinnacles and graceful declivities  told out sharply against the golden sky behind them  which  being  perfectly reflected in the calm lake  gave a grand chain of mountain the  appearance of being suspended in glowing heather  for the lake was one  bright amber sheet of light below  and the mountains one massive barrier  of shade  till they cut against the light above  the boat touched the  shore of innisfallin  and the delighted pair of visitants hurried to its  western point to catch the sunset  lighting with its glory the matchless  foliage of this enchanting spot  where every form of grace exhaustless  nature can display is lavished on the arborial richness of the scene   which  in its unequalled luxuriance  gives to a fanciful beholder the  idea that the  trees themselves have a conscious pleasure in growing  there   oh  what a witching spot is innisfallin     edward had never seen anything so beautiful in his life  and with the  woman he adored resting on his arm  he quoted the lines which moore has  applied to the vale of cashmere  as he asked fanny would she not like to  live there      would you   said fanny     edward answered         if woman can make the worst wilderness dear     think  think what a heaven she must make of cashmere      they lingered on the island till the moon arose  and then re embarked   the silvery light exhibited the lake under another aspect  and the dimly  discovered forms of the lofty hills rose one above another  tier upon  tier  circling the waters in their shadowy frame  the beauty of the  scene reached a point of sublimity which might be called holy  as they  returned towards the shelving strand  a long row of peeled branches   standing upright in the water  attracted fanny s attention  and she  asked their use      all the use in life  my lady   said the boatman   for without the same  branches  maybe it s not home to night you d get      on fanny inquiring further the meaning of the boatman s answer  she  learned that the sticks were placed there to indicate the only channel  which permitted a boat to approach the shore on that side of the lake   where the water was shoal  while in other parts the depth had never been  fathomed     an early excursion on the water was planned for the morning  and edward  and fanny were wakened from their slumbers by the tones of the bugle  a  soft irish melody being breathed by spillan  followed by a more sportive  one from the other minstrel of the lake  ganzy     the lake now appeared under another aspect  the morning sun and morning  breeze were upon it  and the sublimity with which the shades of evening  had invested the mountains was changed to that of the most varied  richness  for autumn hung out its gaudy banner on the lofty hills   crowned to their summits with all variety of wood  which  though tinged  by the declining year  had scarcely shed one leafy honour  the day was  glorious  and the favouring breeze enabled the boat to career across the  sparkling lake under canvas  till the overhanging hills of the opposite  side robbed them of their aerial wings  and the sail being struck  the  boatmen bent to their oars  as they passed under a promontory  clothed  from the water s edge to its topmost ridge with the most luxuriant  vegetation  it was pointed out to the lady as  the minister s back        t is a strange name   said fanny   do you know why it is called so       faix  i dunna  my lady  barrin  that it is the best covered back in  the country  but here we come to the  aichos    said he  resting on his  oars  the example was followed by his fellows  and the bugler  lifting  his instrument to his lips  gave one long well sustained blast  it rang  across the waters gallantly  it returned in a few seconds with such  unearthly sweetness  as though the spirit of the departed sound had  become heavenly  and revisited the place where it had expired     fanny and edward listened breathlessly     the bugle gave out its notes again in the well known  call   and as  sweetly as before the notes were returned distinctly     and now a soft and slow and simple melody stole from the exquisitely  played bugle  and phrase after phrase was echoed from the responding  hills  how many an emotion stirred within edward s breast  as the  melting music fell upon his ear  in the midst of matchless beauties he  heard the matchless strains of his native land  and the echoes of her  old hills responding to the triumphs of her old bards  the air  too   bore with it historic associations   it told a tale of wrong and of  suffering  the wrong has ceased  the suffering is past  but the air  which records them still lives      oh  triumph of the minstrel   exclaimed edward in delight   the tyrant  crumbles in his coffin  while the song of the bard survives  the memory  of a sceptred ruffian is endlessly branded by a simple strain  while  many of the elaborate chronicles of his evil life have passed away and  are mouldering like himself      scarcely had the echoes of this exquisite air died away  when the  entrancement it carried was rudely broken by one of the vulgarest tunes  being brayed from a bugle in a boat which was seen rounding the headland  of the wooded promontory  edward and fanny writhed  and put their hands  to their ears   give way  boys   said edward   for pity s sake get away  from these barbarians  give way      away sprang the boat  to the boatman s inquiry whether they should stop  at  lady kenmare s cottage   fanny said  no   when she found on inquiry  it was a particularly  show place   being certain the vulgar party  following  would  stop there  and therefore time might be gained in  getting away from such disagreeable followers     dinas island  fringed with its lovely woods  excited their admiration   as they passed underneath its shadows  and turned into turk lake  here  the labyrinthine nature of the channels through which they had been  winding was changed for a circular expanse of water  over which the  lofty mountain  whence it takes its name  towers in all its wild beauty  of wood  and rock  and heath     at a certain part of the lake  the boatmen  without any visible cause   rested on their oars  on edward asking them why they did not pull  he  received this touching answer        sure  your honour would not have us disturb ned macarthy s grave       then a boatman was drowned here  i suppose   said edward      yes  your honour   the boatman then told how the accident occurred  one  day when there was a stag hunt on the lake   but as the anecdote struck  edward so forcibly that he afterwards recorded it in verse  we will give  the story after his fashion     macarthy s grave    i      the breeze was fresh  the morn was fair     the stag had left his dewy lair     to cheering horn and baying tongue     killarney s echoes sweetly rung     with sweeping oar and bending mast     the eager chase was following fast     when one light skiff a maiden steer d    beneath the deep wave disappeared     wild shouts of terror wildly ring     a boatman brave  with gallant spring    and dauntless arm  the lady bore     but he who saved  was seen no more     ii      where weeping birches wildly wave     there boatmen show their brother s grave     and while they tell the name he bore     suspended hangs the lifted oar     the silent drops they idly shed    seem like tears to gallant ned     and while gently gliding by     the tale is told with moistened eye     no ripple on the slumbering lake    unhallow d oar doth ever make     all undisturb d  the placid wave    flows gently o er macarthy s grave     winding backwards through the channels which lead the explorers of this  scene of nature s enchantment from the lower to the upper lake  the  surpassing beauty of the  eagle s nest  burst on their view  and as  they hovered under its stupendous crags  clustering with all variety of  verdure  the bugle and the cannon awoke the almost endless reverberation  of sound which is engendered here  passing onward  a sudden change is  wrought  the soft beauty melts gradually away  and the scene hardens  into frowning rocks and steep acclivities  making a befitting vestibule  to the bold and bleak precipices of  the reeks   which form the western  barrier of this upper lake  whose savage grandeur is rendered more  striking by the scenes of fairy like beauty left behind  but even here   in the midst of the mightiest desolation  the vegetative vigour of the  numerous islands proves the wondrous productiveness of the soil in these  regions     on their return  a great commotion was observable as they approached the  rapids formed by the descending waters of the upper lake to the lower   and they were hailed and warned by some of the peasants from the shore  that they must not attempt the rapids at present  as a boat  which had  just been upset  lay athwart the passage  on hearing this  edward and  fanny landed upon the falls  and walked towards the old bridge  where  all was bustle and confusion  as the dripping passengers were dragged  safely to shore from the capsized boat  which had been upset by the  principal gentleman of the party  whose vulgar trumpetings had so  disturbed the delight of edward and fanny  who soon recognised the  renowned andy as the instigator of the bad music and the cause of the  accident  yes  lord scatterbrain  true to his original practice  was  author of all     nevertheless  he and his party  soused over head and ears as they  were  took the thing in good humour  which was unbroken even by the  irrepressible laughter which escaped from edward and fanny  as they  approached and kindly offered assistance  an immediate removal to the  neighbouring cottage on dinas island was recommended  particularly as  lady scatterbrain was in a delicate situation  as well  indeed  as mrs   durfy  who  with her dear tom  had joined lord scatterbrain s party of  pleasure     on reaching the cottage  sufficient change of clothes was obtained  to prevent evil consequences from the ducking  this  under ordinary  circumstances  might not have been easy for so many  but  fortunately   lord scatterbrain had ordered a complete dinner from the hotel to be  served in the cottage  and some of the assistants from the victoria   who were necessarily present  helped to dress more than the dinner  what  between cookmaids and waiters  the care taker of the cottage and the  boatmen  bodies  and skirts  jackets and other conveniences  enabled  the party to sit down to dinner in company  until fire could mend the  mistake of his lordship  edward and fanny courteously joined the party   and the honour of their company was sensibly felt by andy and oonah   who would have borne a ducking a day for the honour of having fanny and  edward as their guests  oonah was by nature a nice creature  and adapted  herself to her elevated position with a modest ease that was surprising   even andy was by this time able to conduct himself tolerably well at  table  only on that particular day he did make a mistake  for when  salmon  which is served at killarney in all sorts of variety  made its  appearance for the first time in the novel form   en papillote     andy ate paper and all  he refused a second cutlet  however  saying he    thought the skin tough    the party  however  passed off mirthfully   the very accident helping the fun  for  instead of any one being called  by name  the  lady in the jacket   or the  gentleman in the bedgown    were the terms of address  and  after a merrily spent evening  the beds  of the victoria gave sleep and pleasing dreams to the sojourners of  killarney      illustration  the party at killarney     kind reader  the shortening space we have prescribed to our volume warns  us we must draw our story to an end  nine months after this killarney  excursion  lord scatterbrain met dick dawson near mount eskar  where  lord scatterbrain had ridden to make certain inquiries about mrs   o connor s health  dick wore a smiling countenance  and to andy s  inquiry answered   all right  and doing as well as can be expected      lord scatterbrain  wishing to know whether it was a boy or a girl  made  the inquiry in the true spirit of andyism   tell me  misther dawson    are you an uncle or an aunt       andy s mother died soon after of the cold caught by her ducking  on her  death bed she called oonah to her  and said   i leave you this quilt    alanna    t is worth more than it appears  the hundred pound notes andy  gave me i quilted into the lining  so that if i lived poor all my life  till lately  i died under a quilt of banknotes  anyhow      uncle bob was gathered to his fathers also  and left the bulk of his  property to augusta  so that furlong had to regret his contemptible  conduct in rejecting her hand  augusta indulged in a spite to all  mankind for the future  enjoying her dogs and her independence  and  defying hymen and hydrophobia for the rest of her life     gusty went on profiting by the early care of edward o connor  whose  friendship was ever his dearest possession  and ratty  always wild   expressed a desire for leading a life of enterprise  as they are both   irish heirs   as well as lord scatterbrain  and heirs under very  different circumstances  it is not improbable

in the  transatlantic voyage  so instantly have itself carried from liverpool  to any point where trains will convey it  liverpool is most worthy to be  seen and known  and no one who looks up from the bacon and eggs of his  first hotel breakfast after landing  and finds himself confronted by the  coal smoked greek architecture of st  george s hall  can deny that it is  of a singularly noble presence  the city has moments of failing in the  promise of this classic edifice  but every now and then it reverts to  it  and reminds the traveller that he is in a great modern metropolis of  commerce by many other noble edifices       i    liverpool does not remind him of this so much as the good and true  baedeker professes  in the dockside run on the overhead railway  as the  place unambitiously calls its elevated road   but then  as i noted in my  account of southampton  docks have a fancy of taking themselves in   and eluding the tourist eye  and even when they  flank the mersey for a  distance of     m   they do not respond to american curiosity so frankly  as could be wished  they are like other english things in that  however   and it must be said for them that when apparent they are sometimes  unimpressive  from my own note book  indeed  i find that i pretended to  think them  wonderful and almost endless   and so i dare say they  are  but they formed only a very perfunctory interest of our day at  liverpool  where we had come to meet  not to take  a steamer     our run from london  in the heart of june  was very quick and pleasant   through a neat country and many tidy towns  in the meadows the elms  seemed to droop like our own rather than to hold themselves oakenly  upright like the english  the cattle stood about in the yellow  buttercups  knee deep  white american daisies  and red clover  and among  the sheep we had our choice of shorn and unshorn  they were equally  abundant  some of the blossomy may was left yet on the hawthorns  and  over all the sky hovered  with pale white clouds in pale blue spaces  of air like an inverted lake of bonnyclabber  we stopped the night at  chester  and the next evening  in the full daylight of       we pushed  on to liverpool  over lovely levels  with a ground swell like that of  kansas plains  under a sunset drying its tears and at last radiantly  smiling       ii    the hotel in liverpool swarmed and buzzed with busy and murmurous  american arrivals  one could hardly get at the office window  on account  of them  to plead for a room  a dense group of our countrywomen were  buying picture postals of the rather suave office ladies  and helplessly  fawning on them in the inept confidences of american women with all  persons in official or servile attendance   let me stay here   one of  them entreated   because there s such a draught at the other window   may i   she was a gentle child of forty five or fifty  and i do not know  whether she was allowed to stay in the sheltered nook or not  tender  creature  as she was in every one else s way there  possibly she was  harshly driven into the flaw at the other window      illustration  st  george s hall  liverpool     the place was a little america which swelled into a larger with the  arrivals of the successive steamers  though the soft swift english  trains bore our co nationals away as rapidly as they could  many  familiar accents remained till the morning  and the breakfast room was  full of a nasal resonance which would have made one at home anywhere in  our east or west  i  who was then vainly trying to be english  escaped  to the congenial top of the farthest bound tram  and flew  at the rate  of four miles an hour  to the uttermost suburbs of liverpool  whither  no rumor of my native speech could penetrate  it was some balm to my  wounded pride of country to note how pale and small the average type of  the local people was  the poorer classes swarmed along a great part  of the tram line in side streets of a hard  stony look  and what  characterized itself to me as a sort of iron squalor seemed to prevail   you cannot anywhere have great prosperity without great adversity  just  as you cannot have day without night  and the more liverpool evidently  flourished the more it plainly languished  i found no pleasure in the  paradox  and i was not overjoyed by the inevitable ugliness of the brick  villas of the suburbs into which these obdurate streets decayed  but  then  after divers tram changes  came the consolation of beautiful  riverside beaches  thronged with people who looked gay at that distance   and beyond the mersey rose the welsh hills  blue  blue       iii    at the end of the tram line  where we necessarily dismounted  we  rejected a thatched cottage  offering us tea  because we thought it too  thatched and too cottage to be quite true  though i do not now say that  there were vermin in the straw roof   and accepted the hospitality of  a pastry cook s shop  we felt the more at home with the kind woman  who kept it because she had a brother at chicago in the employ of the  pinkerton detective agency  and had once been in stratford on avon  this  doubly satisfied us as cultivated americans  she had a welsh name  and  she testified to a great prevalence of welsh and irish in the population  of liverpool  besides  she sent us to a church of the crusaders at  little crosby  and it was no fault of hers that we did not find it  we  found one of the many old crosses for which little crosby is named  and  this was quite as much as we merited  it stood at the intersection of  the streets in what seemed the fragment of a village  not yet lost in  the vast maw of the city  and it calmed all the simple neighborhood   so that we sat down at its foot and rested a long  long minute till the  tram came by and took us back into the loud  hard heart of liverpool     i do not mean to blame it  for it was no louder or harder than the  hearts of other big towns  and it had some alleviation from the many  young couples who were out together half holidaying in the unusually  pleasant saturday weather  i wish their complexions had been better   but you cannot have south of england color if you live as far north as  liverpool  and all the world knows what the american color is  the young  couples abounded in the gallery of fine arts  where they frankly looked  at one another instead of the pictures  the pictures might have been  better  but then they might have been worse  there being examples of  filippo lippi  memmi  holbein  and  above all  the  dante s dream  of  rossetti   and in any case those couples could come and see them when  they were old men and women  but now they had one another in a moment of  half holiday which could not last forever     in the evening there were not so many lovers at the religious meetings  before the classic edifice opposite the hotel  where the devotions were  transacted with the help of a brass band  but there were many youths  smoking short pipes  and flitting from one preacher to another  in the  half dozen groups  some preachers were nonconformist  but there was one  perspiring anglican priest who labored earnestly with his hearers  and  who had more of his aspirates in the right place  many of his hearers  were in the rags which seem a favorite wear in liverpool  and i hope his  words did their poor hearts good     slightly apart from the several congregations  i found myself with a  fellow foreigner of seafaring complexion who addressed me in an accent  so unlike my own american that i ventured to answer him in italian  he  was indeed a genoese  who had spent much time in buenos ayres and was  presently thinking of new york  and we had some friendly discourse  together concerning the english  his ideas of them were often so  parallel with my own that i hardly know how to say he thought them  an improvident people  i owned that they spent much more on state  or  station  than the americans  but we neither had any censure for them  otherwise  he was of that philosophic mind which one is rather apt to  encounter in the latin races  and i could well wish for his further  acquaintance  his talk rapt me to far other and earlier scenes  and i  seemed to be conversing with him under a venetian heaven  among objects  of art more convincing than the equestrian statue of the late queen  who  had no special motive i could think of for being shown to her rightly  loving subjects on horseback  we parted with the expressed hope of  seeing each other again  and if this should meet his eye and he can  recall the pale young man  with the dark full beard  who chatted with  him between the pillars of the piazzetta  forty years before our actual  encounter i would be glad of his address       iv    how strange are the uses of travel  there was a time when the mention  of liverpool would have conjured up for me nothing but the thought of  hawthorne  who spent divers dull consular years there  and has left a  record of them which i had read  with the wish that it were cheerfuler   yet  now  here on the ground his feet might have trod  and in the very  smoke he breathed  i did not once think of him  i thought as little of  that poor felicia hemans  whose poetry filled my school reading years  with the roar of the wintry sea breaking from the waveless plymouth bay  on the stern and rock bound coast where the pilgrim fathers landed on a  bowlder measuring eight by ten feet  now fenced in against the predatory  hammers and chisels of reverent visitors  i knew that gladstone was born  at liverpool  but not mrs  oliphant  and the only literary shade i could  summon from a past vague enough to my ignorance was william roscoe   whose  life of leo x    in the bohn library  had been too much for my  young zeal when my zeal was still young  my other memories of liverpool  have been acquired since my visit  and i now recur fondly to the  picturesque times when king john founded a castle there  to the prouder  times when sir francis bacon represented it in parliament  or again to  the brave days when it resisted prince rupert for three weeks  and the  inglorious epoch when the new city  it was then only some four or five  hundred years old  began to flourish on the trade in slaves with the  colonies of the spanish main  and on the conjoint and congenial traffic  in rum  sugar  and tobacco      illustration  the wellington monument  liverpool     it will be suspected from these reminiscences that i have been studying  a page of fine print in baedeker  and i will not deceive the reader  it  is true  but it is also true that i had some wonder  altogether my own   that so great a city should make so small an appeal to the imagination   in this it outdoes almost any metropolis of our own  even in journalism   an intensely modern product  it does not excel  manchester has its able  and well written  guardian   but what has liverpool  glasgow has its  glasgow school of painting  but again what has liverpool  it is said  that not above a million of its people live in it  all the rest  who  can  escape to chester  where they perhaps vainly hope to escape the  americans  there  intrenched in charming villas behind myrtle hedges   they measurably do so  but americans are very penetrating  and i would  not be sure that the thickest and highest hedge was invulnerable to  them  as it is  they probably constitute the best society of liverpool   which the natives have abandoned to them  though they do not constitute  it permanently  but consecutively  every cunarder  every white star   pours out upon a city abandoned by its own good society a flood of  cultivated americans  who eddy into its hotels  and then rush out  of them by every train within twenty four hours  and often within  twenty five minutes  they understand that there are no objects of  interest in liverpool  and they are not met at the customs with  invitations to breakfast  luncheon  and dinner from the people of rank  and fashion with whom they have come to associate  these have their  stately seats in the lovely neighboring country  but they are not at the  landing stage  and even the uncultivated american cannot stay for the  vast bourgeoisie of which liverpool  like the cities of his own land   is composed  our own cities have a social consciousness  and are each  sensible of being a centre  with a metropolitan destiny  but the strange  thing about liverpool and the like english towns is that they are  without any social consciousness  their meek millions are socially  unborn  they can come into the world only in london  and in their  prenatal obscurity they remain folded in a dreamless silence  while all  the commercial and industrial energies rage round them in a gigantic  maturity       v    the time was when liverpool was practically the sole port of entry  for our human cargoes  indentured apprentices of the beautiful  the  historical  with the almost immediate transference of the original  transatlantic steamship interests from bristol  liverpool became the  only place where you could arrive  american lines  long erased from the  seas  and the inman line  the cunard line  the white star line  and the  rest  would land you nowhere else  then heretical steamers began to land  you at glasgow  worse schismatics carried you to southampton  there  were heterodox craft that touched at plymouth  and now great swelling  agnostics bring you to london itself  still  liverpool remains the  greatest port of entry for our probationers  who are bound out to the  hotels and railroad companies of all europe till they have morally paid  back their fare  the superstition that if you go in a cunarder you can  sleep on both ears is no longer so exclusive as it once was  yet the  cunarder continues an ark of safety for the timid and despairing   and the cooking is so much better than it used to be that if in  contravention of the old cunard rule against a passenger s being carried  overboard you do go down  you may be reasonably sure of having eaten  something that the wallowing sea monsters will like in you      illustration  the liverpool docks     i have tried to give some notion of the fond behavior of the arriving  americans in the hotels  no art can give the impression of their  exceeding multitude  expresses  panting with as much impatience as the  disciplined english expresses ever suffer themselves to show  await them  in the stations  which are effectively parts of the great hotels  and  whir away to london with them as soon as they can drive up from the  steamer  but many remain to rest  to get the sea out of their heads  and legs  and to prepare their spirits for adjustment to the novel  conditions  these the successive trains carry into the heart of the land  everywhere  these and their baggage  to which they continue attached by  their very heart strings  invisibly stretching from their first class  corridor compartments to the different luggage vans  i must say they  have very tenderly  very perfectly imagined us  all those hotel people  and railroad folk  and fold us  anxious and bewildered exiles  in a  reassuring and consoling embrace which leaves all their hands  they are  briarean  free for the acceptance of our wide  wild tips  you may trust  yourself implicitly to their care  but if you are going to oxford do not  trust the head porter who tells you to take the london and northwestern   for then you will have to change four times on the way and at every  junction personally see that your baggage is unladen and started anew to  its destination                                                         some merits of manchester      i will suppose the reader not to be going to oxford  but  in compliance  with the scheme of this paper  to manchester  where there is perhaps  no other reason for his going  he will there  for one thing  find the  supreme type of the railroad hotel which in england so promptly shelters  and so kindly soothes the fluttered exile  at manchester  even more than  at liverpool  we are imagined in the immense railroad station hotel   which is indeed perhaps superorganized and over convenienced after an  american ideal  one does not  for instance  desire a striking  or even  a ticking  clock in the transom above one s bedroom door  but the like  type of hotel is to be found at every great railroad centre or terminal  in england  and it is never to be found quite bad  though of course it  is sometimes better and sometimes worse  it is hard to know if it is  more hotel or more station  perhaps it is a mixture of each which defies  analysis  but in its well studied composition you pass  as it were  from  your car to your room  as from one chamber to another  this is putting  the fact poetically  but  prosaically  the intervening steps are few at  the most  and when you have entered your room your train has ceased to  be  the simple miracle would be impossible in america  where our trains   when not shrieking at the tops of their whistles  are backing and  filling with a wild clangor of their bells  and making a bedlam of their  stations  but in england they          come like shadows  so depart      and make no sound within the vast caravansary where the enchanted  traveller has changed from them into a world of dreams       i    these hotels are  next to the cathedrals  perhaps the greatest wonder  of england  and in manchester the railway hotel is in some ways more  wonderful than the cathedral  which is not so much planned on our native  methods  yet this has the merit  if it is a merit  of antedating our  discovery by nearly a century  and pre historically it is indefinitely  older  my sole recorded impression of it is that i found it smelling  strongly of coal gas  such as comes up the register when your furnace is  mismanaged  but that is not strange in such a manufacturing centre  and  it would be paltering with the truth not to own a general sense of the  beauty and grandeur in it which no english cathedral is without  the  morning was fitly dim and chill  and one could move about in the vague  all the more comfortably for the absence of that appeal of thronging  monuments which harasses and bewilders the visitor in other cathedrals   one could really give one s self up to serious emotion  and not be  sordidly and rapaciously concerned with objects of interest  manchester  has been an episcopal see only some fifty years  before that the  cathedral was simply t  owd church  and in this character it is still  venerable  and is none the less so because of the statue of oliver  cromwell which holds the chief place in the open square before it  call  it an incongruity  if you will  but that enemy of episcopacy is at least  not accused of stabling his horses in the old church at manchester  or  despoiling it of its sacred images and stained glass  and he merits a  monument there if anywhere      illustration  manchester cathedral     with the constantly passing trams which traverse the square  he is  undoubtedly more significant of modern manchester than the episcopacy  is  and perhaps of that older manchester which held for him against the  king  and that yet older manchester of john bradford  the first martyr  of the reformation to suffer death at the stake in smithfield  of the  still yet older  far older manchester  which trafficked with the greeks  of marseilles  and later passed under the yoke of agricola and was  a roman military station  and got the name of maen ceaster from the  saxons  and was duly bedevilled by the danes and mishandled by the  normans  there may be traces in the temperament of the modern town  which would escape even the scrutiny of the hurried american  such  a compatriot was indeed much more bent upon getting a pair of cotton  socks  like those his own continent wears almost universally in summer   but a series of exhaustive visits to all the leading haberdashers in  manchester developed the strange fact that there  in the world heart of  the cotton spinning industry  there was no such thing to be found   in manchester there are only woollen socks  heavier or lighter  to be  bought  and the shopmen smile pityingly if you say  in your strange  madness  that woollen socks are not for summer wear  possibly  however   it was not summer in manchester  and we were misled by the almanac   possibly we had been spoiled by three weeks of warm  sunny rain on the  welsh coast  and imagined a vain thing in supposing that the end of  august was not the beginning of november       ii    i thought manchester  however  as it shows itself in its public  edifices  a most dignified town  with as great beauty as could be  expected of a place which has always had so much to do besides looking  after its figure and complexion  the very charming series or system  of parks  public gardens  and playgrounds  unusual in their number and  variety  had a sympathetic allure in the gray  cool light  even to the  spectator passing in a hurried hansom  they have not the unity of  the boston or chicago parkways  and i will own that i had not come to  manchester for them  what interested me more were the miles and miles  of comfortable looking little brick houses in which  for all i knew  the  mill labor dwelt  very possibly it did not  the mills themselves are  now nearly all  or mostly  outside of manchester  and perhaps for this  reason i did not find the slums  when shown them  very slummy  and i  saw no such dreadful shapes of rags and dirt as in liverpool  we passed  through a quarter of large  old fashioned mansions  as charming as  they were unimagined of manchester  but these could not have been the  dwellings of the mill hands  any more than of the mill owners  the  mill owners  at least  live in suburban palaces and villas  which i  fancy by this time are not            pricking a cockney ear      as in the time of tennyson s  maud      what wild and whirling insolences  however  the people who have greatly  made the greatness of england have in all times suffered from their  poets and novelists  with few exceptions  one need not be a very blind  devotee of commercialism or industrialism to resent the affronts put  upon them  when one comes to the scenes of such mighty achievement as  liverpool  and manchester  and sheffield  but how mildly they seem to  have taken it all  with what a meek subordination and sufferance  one  asks one s self whether the society of such places can be much inferior  to that of pittsburg  or chicago  or st  louis  which  even from the  literary attics of new york  we should not exactly allow ourselves to  spit upon  practically  i know nothing about society in manchester  or  rather  out of it  and i can only say of the general type  of richer or  poorer  as i saw it in the streets  that it was uncommonly good  not so  many women as men were abroad in such weather as we had  and i cannot be  sure that the sex shows there that superiority physically which it has  long held morally with us  one learns in the north not to look for the  beautiful color of the south and west  but in manchester the average  faces were intelligent and the figures good       iii    with such a journal as the manchester  guardian  still keeping its  high rank among english newspapers  there cannot be question of the  journalistic sort of thinking in the place  of the sort that comes to  its effect in literature  such as  say  mrs  gaskell s novels  there may  also still be as much as ever  and i will not hazard my safe ignorance  in a perilous conjecture  i can only say that of the unitarianism  which eventuated in that literature  i heard it had largely turned to  episcopacy  as unitarianism has in our own boston  i must not forget  that one of our religions  now a dying faith  was invented in manchester  by ann lee  who brought  through the usual persecutions  shakerism to  such spiritual importance as it has now lost in these states  only those  who have known the shakers  with their good lives and gentle ways   can regret with me the decline of the celibate communism which their  foundress imagined in her marital relations with the lancashire  blacksmith she left behind her     i am reminded  or perhaps instructed  by mr  hope moncrieff in black s  excellent  guide to manchester  that before mrs  gaskell s celebrity the  fitful fame of de quincey shed a backward gleam upon his native place   which can still show the house where he was probably born and the  grammar school he certainly ran away from  in my forgetfulness  or my  ignorance  that manchester was the mother of this tricksy master spirit  of english prose  who was an idol of my youth  i failed to visit either  house  the renown of cobden and of bright is precious to a larger world  than mine  and the name of the stalwart quaker friend of man is dear  to every american who remembers the heroic part he played in our behalf  during our war for the union  it is one of the amusing anomalies of  the british constitution  that the great city from whose political  fame these names are inseparable should have had no representation in  parliament from cromwell s time to victoria s  fancy akron  ohio  or  grand rapids  michigan  without a member of congress      illustration  town hall  manchester     the  manchester school  of political economy has long since passed  into reproach if not obloquy with people for whom a byword is a potent  weapon  and perhaps the easiest they can handle  and i am not myself  so extreme a  laissez faireist  as to have thought of that school with  pathos in the city of its origin  but i dare say it was a good thing  in its time  we are only now slowly learning how to apply the opposite  social principles in behalf of the man rather than the master  and  we have not yet surmounted all the difficulties or dangers of the  experiment  it is droll how  in a tolerably well meaning world like  this  any sort of contempt becomes inclusive  and a whole population  suffers for the vice  or it may be the virtue  of a very small majority   or a very powerful minority  probably the most liberal and intelligent  populations of great britain are those of manchester and birmingham   names which have stood for a hard and sordid industrialism  unrelieved  by noble sympathies and impulses  it is quite possible that a less  generous spirit than mine would have censured the  manchester school   for the weather of the place  and found in its cold gray light the  effect of the gradgrind philosophy which once wrapt a world of fiction  in gloom       iv    i can only be sure that the light  what little there was of it  was very  cold and gray  but it quite sufficed to show the huge lowries  as the  wagons are called  passing through the streets with the cotton fabrics  of the place in certain stages of manufacture  perhaps the raw  perhaps  the finished material  in manchester itself one sees not much else of   the cotton spinning chorus  which has sent its name so far  the cotton  is now spun in ten or twenty towns in the nearer or farther neighborhood  of the great city  as every one but myself and some ninety millions of  other americans well know  i had seen something of cotton mills in our  lowell  and i was eager  if not willing  to contrast them with the mills  of manchester  but such of these as still remained there were  for my  luckless moment  inoperative  personal influences brought me within one  or two days of their starting up  one almost started up during my brief  stay  but a great mill  employing perhaps a thousand hands  cannot start  up for the sake of the impression desired by the aesthetic visitor  and  i had to come away without mine     i had to come away without that personal acquaintance with the great  manchester ship canal which i almost equally desired  coming or going  i  asked about it  and was told  looking for it from the car window  there    there  it was  but beyond a glimpse of something very long and very  straight marking the landscape with lines no more convincing than those  which science was once decided  and then undecided  to call canals on  the planet mars  i had no sight of it  i do not say this was not  my fault  and i will not pretend that the canal  like the mills of  manchester  was not running  i dare say i was not in the right hands   but this was not for want of trying to get into them  in the local  delusion that it was then summer  those whose kindness might have  befriended the ignorance of the stranger were  away on their holidays    that was exactly the phrase     when  by a smiling chance  i fell into the right hands and was borne  to the cotton exchange i did not fail of a due sense of the important  scene  i hope  the building itself  like the other public buildings of  manchester  is most dignified  and the great hall of the exchange is  very noble  i would not  if i could  have repressed a thrill of pride  in seeing our national colors and emblems equalled with those of great  britain at one end of the room  but these were the only things american  in the impression left  we made our way through the momently thickening  groups on the floor  and in the guidance of a member of the exchange  found a favorable point of observation in the gallery  from this the  vast space below showed first a moving surface of hats  with few silk  toppers among them  but a multitude of panamas and other straws  the  marketing was not carried on with anything like the wild  rangy movement  of our stock exchange  and the floor sent up no such hell roaring  there  is no other phrase for it  tumult as rises from the mad but not malign  demons of that most dramatic representation of perdition  the merchants   alike staid  whether old or young  congregated in groups which  dealing  in a common type of goods  kept the same places till  toward three  o clock  they were lost in the mass which covered the floor  even  then there was no uproar  no rush or push  no sharp cries or frenzied  shouting  but from the crowd  which was largely made up of elderly men   there rose a sort of surd  rich hum  deepening ever  and never breaking  into a shriek of torment or derision  it was not histrionic  and yet for  its commercial importance it was one of the most moving spectacles which  could offer itself to the eye in the whole world      illustration  the manchester ship canal     i cannot pretend to have profited by my visit to that immensely valuable  deposit of books  bought from the spencer family at althorp  and  dedicated as the rylands library to the memory of a citizen of  manchester  books in a library  except you have time and free access to  them  are as baffling as so many bottles in a wine cellar  which are  not opened for you  and which if they were would equally go to your head  without final advantage  i find  therefore  that my sole note upon  the rylands library is the very honest one that it smelt  like the  cathedral  of coal gas  the absence of this gas was the least merit  of the beautiful old chetham college  with its library dating from the  seventeenth century  and claiming to have been the first free library in  england  and doubtless the world  in the cloistered picturesqueness  of the place  its mediaeval memorials  and its ancient peace  i found  myself again in those dear middle ages which are nowhere quite wanting  in england  and against which i rubbed off all smirch of the modernity i  had come to manchester for                                                         in smokiest sheffield      if i had waited a little till i had got into the beautiful derbyshire  country which lies  or rather rolls  between manchester and sheffield   i could as easily have got rid of my epoch in the smiling agricultural  landscape  i do not know just the measure of the black country in  england  or where sheffield begins to be perhaps the blackest spot in  it  but i am sure that nothing not surgically clean could be whiter than  the roads that  almost as soon as we were free of manchester  began to  climb the green  thickly wooded hills  and dip into the grassy and leafy  valleys  in the very heart of the loveliness we found sheffield most  nobly posed against a lurid sunset  and clouding the sky  which can  never be certain of being blue  with the smoke of a thousand towering  chimneys  from whatever point you have it  the sight is most prodigious   but no doubt the subjective sense of the great ducal mansions and  estates which neighbor the mirky metropolis of steel and iron has its  part in heightening the dramatic effect       i    the english  with their love of brevity and simplicity  call these proud  seats the dukeries  but our affair was not with them  and i shall not  be able to follow the footmen or butlers or housekeepers who would  so obligingly show them to the reader in my company  i had a fine  consciousness of passing some of them on my way into the town  and when  there of being  however  incongruously  in the midst of them   worksop  more properly than sheffield  is the plebeian heart of these  aristocratic homes  or sojourns  which no better advised traveller   or less hurried  will fail to see  but i was in sheffield to see the  capital of the black country in its most characteristic aspects  and i  thought it felicitously in keeping  after i had dined  less well than i  could have wished  at the railway hotel which scarcely kept the promise  made for it by other like hotels  that i should be tempted beyond my  strength to go and see that colored opera which we had lately sent   after its signal success with us  to an even greater prosperity in  england   in dahomey  is a musical drama not pitched in the highest key   but it is a genuine product of our national life  and to witness its  performance by the colored brethren who invented it  and were giving  it with great applause in an atmosphere quite undarkened by our racial  prejudices  was an experience which i would not have missed for many  dukeries  the kindly house was not so suffocatingly full that it could  not find breath for cheers and laughter  but i proudly felt that no  one there could delight so intelligently as the sole american  in the  familiar bowery figures  the blue policemen  the varying darky types   which peopled a scene largely laid in africa  the local new york  suggestions were often from mr  edward harrigan  and all the more  genuine for that  but there was a final cake walk which owed its  inspiration wholly to the genius of a race destined to greater triumphs  in music and art  and perhaps to a kindlier civilization than our ideals  have evolved in yet  it was pleasant to look upon those different shades  of color  from dead black to creamy blond  in their novel relief against  an air of ungrudging  of even respectful  appreciation  and i dare say  the poor things liked it for themselves as much as i liked it for them   at a fine moment of the affair i was aware of a figure in evening dress   standing near me  and regarding the stage with critical severity   a young man  but shrewd and well in hand  who  as the unmistakable  manager  was  i hope  finally as well satisfied as the other spectators       ii    i myself came away entirely satisfied  indeed  but for the lasting pang  i inflicted upon myself by denying a penny to the ragged wretch who  superfluously opened the valves of my hansom for me  my explanation to  my soul was that i had no penny in my pocket  and that it would have  been folly little short of crime to give so needy a wretch sixpence  but  would it  would it have corrupted him  since pauperize him further it  could not  i advise the reader who finds himself in the like case to  give the sixpence  and if he cares for the peace of my conscience  to  make it a shilling  or  come  a half crown  if he wishes to be truly  handsome  it is astonishing how these regrets persist  but perhaps in  this instance i owe the permanence of my pang to those frequent appeals  to one s pity which repeated themselves in sheffield  as i had noted at  liverpool i now noted at sheffield that you cannot have great prosperity  without having adversity  just as you cannot have heat without cold or  day without dark  the one substantiates and verifies the other  and i  perceived that wherever business throve it seemed to be at the cost of  somebody  though even when business pines it is apparently no better   the thing ought to be looked into     at the moment of my visit to sheffield  it happened that many works were  running half time or no time  and many people were out of work  at one  place there was a little oblong building between branching streets   round which sat a miserable company of murchers  as i heard them called   on long benches under the overhanging roof  who were too obviously  who  were almost offensively  out of work  some were old and some young  some  dull and some fierce  some savage and some imbecile in their looks  and  they were all stained and greasy and dirty  and looked their apathy or  their grim despair  even the men who were coming to or from their work  at dinner time looked stunted and lean and pale  with no color of that  south of england bloom with which they might have favored a stranger   slatternly girls and women abounded  and little babies carried about by  a little larger babies  and of course kissed on their successive layers  of dirt  there were also many small boys who  i hope  were not so wicked  as they were ragged  at noon time they hung much about the windows of  cookshops which one would think their sharp hunger would have pierced  to the steaming and smoking dishes within  the very morning after i had  denied that man a penny at the theatre door  and was still smarting to  think i had not given him sixpence  i saw a boy of ten  in the cut down  tatters of a man  gloating upon a meat pie which a cook had cruelly set  behind the pane in front of him  i took out the sixpence which i ought  to have given that poor man  and made it a shilling  and put it into  the boy s wonderfully dirty palm  and bade him go in and get the pie  he  looked at me  and he looked at the shilling  and then i suppose he did  as he was bid  but i ought to say  in justice to myself  that i never  did anything of the kind again as long as i remained in sheffield  i  felt that i owed a duty to the place and must not go about corrupting  the populace for my selfish pleasure       iii    between our hotel and the main part of the town there yawned a black  valley  rather nobly bridged  or viaducted  and beyond it in every  direction the chimneys of the many works thickened in the perspectives   it was really like a dead forest  or like thick set masts of shipping  in a thronged port  or the vents of tellurian fires  which send up  their flames by night and their smoke by day  it was splendid  it was  magnificent  it was insurpassably picturesque  people must have painted  it often  but if some bravest artist soul would come  reverently  not  patronizingly  and portray the sight in its naked ugliness  he would  create one of the most beautiful masterpieces in the world  on our first  morning the sun  when it climbed to the upper heavens  found a little  hole in the dun pall  and shone down through it  and tried to pierce  through the more immediate cloud above the works  but it could not  and  it ended by shutting the hole under it  and disappearing     beyond the foul avenues thridding the region of the works  and smelling  of the decay of market houses  were fine streets of shops and churches   and i dare say comely dwellings  with tram cars ascending and descending  their hilly slopes  the stores i find noted as splendid  and in my  pocket book i say that outside of the market house  before you got to  those streets  there are doves and guinea pigs as well as a raven for  sale in cages  and the usual horrible english display of flesh meats   the trams were one story  like our trolleys  without roof seats  and  there were plenty of them  but nothing could keep me  i suppose  till  i had seen one of the works  each of these stands in a vast yard  or  close  by itself  with many buildings  and they are of all sorts  but  i chose what i thought the most typical  and overcame the reluctance  of the manager to let me see it  he said i had no idea what tricks were  played by other makers to find out any new processes and steal them  but  this was after i had pleaded my innocent trade of novelist  and assured  him of my congenital incapability of understanding  much less conveying  from the premises  the image of the simplest and oldest process  then he  gave me for guide an intelligent man who was a penknife maker by trade   but was presently out of work  and glad to earn my fee     my guide proved a most decent  patient  and kindly person  and i hope  it is no betrayal of confidence to say that he told me the men in  these multitudinous shops work by the piece  the grinders furnish their  grindstones and all their tools for making the knives  there is no dry  grinding  such as used to fill the lungs of the grinders with deadly  particles of steel and stone  and bring them to an early death  but  sometimes a stone  which ordinarily lasts six months  will burst and  drive the grinder through the roof  the blade makers do their own  forging and hammering  and it is from first to last apparently all  hand work  but it is head work and heart work too  and the men who  wrought at it wrought with such intensity and constancy that they did  not once look up or round where we paused to look on  i was made to know  that trade was dull and work slack  and these fellows were lucky fellows  to have anything to do  still i did not envy them  and i felt it a  distinct relief to pass from their shops into the cool  dim crypt which  was filled with tusks of ivory  in all sizes from those of the  largest father elephant to those of the babes of the herd  these were  milk tusks  i suppose  they get dearer as the elephants get scarcer  and  that must have been why i paid as much for a penknife in the glittering  showroom as it would have cost me in new york  with the passage money  and the duties added  because of the price  perhaps  i did not think of  buying the two thousand bladed penknife i saw there  but i could never  have used all the blades  now that we no longer make quill pens  i  looked fondly at the maker s name on the knife i did buy  and said that  the table cutlery of a certain small household which set itself up forty  years ago had borne the same  but the pleasant salesman did not seem to  feel the pathos of the fact so much as i       iv    there is not only a vast deal of industry in sheffield  but there is  an unusual abundance of history  as there might very well be in a place  that began life  in the usual english fashion  under the britons and  grew into municipal consciousness in the fostering care of the romans  and the ruder nurture of the saxons  danes  and normans  lords it had of  the last  and the great line of the earls of shrewsbury presently rose  and led sheffield men back to battle in france  where the first earl  fell on the bloody field  and so many of the men died with him in       that there was not a house in all the region which did not mourn a loss   which of the roses sheffield held for  white or red  i am not sure   but we will say that it duly suffered for one or the other  and it is  certain that the great cardinal wolsey rested eighteen days at sheffield  manor just before he went to die at leicester  and mary queen of scots  spent fourteen years of sorrowful captivity  sometimes at the manor  and sometimes in sheffield castle  this hold was taken by the  parliamentarians in the civil war  but the famous industries of the  place had begun long before  so that chaucer could say of one of his  pilgrims           a sheffield thwytel bare he in his hose      thwytels  or whittles  figured in the broils and stage plays of  elizabethan times  and three gross of them were exported from liverpool  in       when the sheffield penknife was already famed the best in the  world  manufactures flourished there apace when england turned to them  from agriculture  and sheffield is now a city of four hundred thousand  or more  apparently it has been growing radical  as the centres of  prosperity and adversity always do  and the days of the chartist  agitation continued there for ten years  from      till it came as near  open rebellion as it well could in a plot for an armed uprising  then  that cause of the people  like many another  failed  and liberty there   as elsewhere in england  was fain to             broaden slowly down       from precedent to precedent      labor troubles  patient or violent  have followed  as labor troubles  must  but leisure has always been equal to their pacification  and now  sheffield takes its adversity almost as quietly as its prosperity      illustration  town hall  sheffield       v    we were not there  though  for others  labor or leisure  which we have  plenty of at home  but even before i appeased such conscience as i had  about seeing a type of the works  we went a long drive up out of the  town to that manor where the poor  brilliant  baddish scotch queen was  imprisoned by her brilliant  baddish english cousin  in any question  of goodness  there was little to choose between them  both were  blood stained liars  but it is difficult being a good woman and a queen  too  and they only failed where few have triumphed  mary is the more  appealing to the fancy because she suffered beyond her deserts   but elizabeth was to be pitied because mary had made it politically  imperative for her to kill her  all this we had threshed out many times  before  and had said that  cat for cat  mary was the more dangerous  because she was the more feminine  and elizabeth the more detestable  because she was the more masculine in her ferocity  we were therefore  in the right mood to visit mary s prison  and we were both indignant and  dismayed to find that our driver  called from a mews at a special price  set upon his intelligence  had never heard of it and did not know where  it was     we reported his inability to the head porter  who came out of the hotel  in a fine flare of sarcasm   you call yourself a sheffield man and not  know where the old manor is   he began  and presently reduced that proud  ignoramus of a driver to such a willingness to learn that we thought it  at least safe to set out with him  and so started for the long climb  up the hills that hold sheffield in their hollow  when we reached their  crest  we looked down and back through the clearer air upon as strange  and grand a sight as could be  it was as if we were looking into the  crater of a volcano  which was sending up its smoke through a thousand  vents  all detail of the works and their chimneys was lost in the  retrospect  one was aware only of a sort of sea of vapor through which  they loomed and gloomed     our ascent was mostly through winding and climbing streets of  little dirty houses  with frowsy gardens beside them  and the very  dirtiest faced children in england playing about them  from time to time  our driver had to ask his way of the friendly flat bosomed slatterns   with babies in their arms  on their thresholds  or the women tending  shop  or peddling provisions  who were all kind to him  and assured him  with varying degrees of confidence that the old manor was a bit  or a  goodish bit  beyond  all at once we came upon the sight of it on an open  top  hard by what is left of the ruins of the real manor  where wolsey  stayed that little while from death  the relics are broken walls  higher  here  lower there  with some tudor fireplaces showing through their  hollow windows  what we saw in tolerable repair was the tower of the  manor  or the lodge  and we drove to it across a field  on a track made  by farm carts  and presently kept by a dog that showed his teeth in a  grin not wholly of amusement at our temerity  while we debated whether  we had not better let the driver get down and knock  a farmer like man  came to the door and called the dog off  then  in a rich north country  accent  he welcomed us to his kitchen parlor  where his wife was peeling  potatoes for their midday dinner  and so led us up the narrow stone  stairs of the tower to the chambers where mary miserably passed those  many long years of captivity     the rooms were visibly restored in every point where they could have  needed restoration  but they were not ruthlessly or too insistently  restored  there was even an antique chair  but when our guide was put on  his honor as to whether it was one of the original chairs he answered    well  if people wanted a chair   he was a rather charmingly quaint   humorous person  with that queer conscience  and he did not pretend to  be moved by the hard inexorable stoniness of the place which had been  a queen s prison for many years  one must not judge it too severely   though  bowers and prisons of that day looked much alike  and mary  stuart may have felt this a bower  and only hated it because she could  not get out of it  or anyhow break the relentless hold of that earl and  countess of shrewsbury whose captive guest she was  though she never  ceased trying  we went up on the wide flat roof  of lead or stone   whither her feet must have so often heavily climbed  and looked out over  the lovely landscape which she must have abhorred  and the wind that  blew over it  in late august  was very cold  far colder than the air of  the prison  or the bower  below     the place belongs now to the duke of norfolk  the great catholic duke   and owes its restoration to his pity and his piety  our farmer guide  was himself a protestant  but he spoke well of the duke  with whom he  reported himself in such colloquies as   i says to dook   and   dook  says to me   when he understood that we were americans he asked after a  son of his who had gone out to our continent twenty years before  he had  only heard from him once  and that on the occasion of his being robbed  of all his money by a roommate  it was in a place called massatusy  we  suggested massachusetts  and he assented that such might be the place   and mary s prison house acquired an added pathos       vi    we drove back through the beautiful park  the duke of norfolk s gift to  sheffield  which is plentifully provided  like all english towns  with  public pleasure grounds  they lie rather outside of it  but within it  are many and many religious and civic edifices which merit to be seen   we chose as chiefest the ancient parish church  of norman origin and  modern restoration  where we visited the tomb of the lord and lady  shrewsbury who were mary stuart s jailers  or if they were not  a pair  of their family were  and it comes to the same thing  emotionally  the  chapel in which they lie is most beautiful  and the verger had just  brushed the carpet within the chancel to such immaculate dustlessness  that he could not bring himself to let us walk over it  he let us walk  round it  and we saw the chapel as a favor  which we discharged with an  abnormal tip after severe debate whether a person of this verger s rich  respectability and perfect manner would take any tip at all  in the  event it appeared that he would                                                         nine days  wonder in york      perhaps it would be better to come to york somewhat earlier in the year  than the  d of september  by that time the english summer has suffered  often if not severe discouragements  it has really only two months out  of the year to itself  and even july and august are not always constant  to it  to be sure  their defection cannot spoil it  but they dispose it  to the slights of september in a dejection from which there is no rise  to those coquetries with october known to our own summer  yet  having  said so much  i feel bound to add that our nine days in york  from the   d to the   th of september  were more summer than autumn days  some  wholly  some partly  with hours of sunshine keeping the flowers bright  which the rain kept fresh  if you walked fast in this sunshine you were  quite hot  and sometimes in the rain you were uncomfortably warm  or at  least you were wet  if the mornings demanded a fire in the grate  the  evenings were so clement that the lamp was sufficient  and the noons  were very well with neither       i    the day of our arrival in york began bright at sheffield  where there  was a man quarrelling so loudly and aimlessly in the station that we  were glad to get away from him  as well as from the mountains of slag  surrounding the iron metropolis  the train ran through a pass in these   and then we found ourselves in a plain country  and  though the day  turned gray and misty  there seemed a sort of stored sunshine in the  fields of wheat which the farmers were harvesting far and near  one has  heard so much of the decay of the english agriculture that one sees  what is apparently the contrary with nothing less than astonishment  the  acreage of these wheat fields was large  and the yield heavier than i  could remember to have seen at home  where the crop had been got in   much ploughing for the next year had been done already  and where the  ploughing was finished the work of sowing by drill was going steadily  forward  in the faith that such an unprecedented summer as was now  passing would return another year  at all these pleasant labors  of  course  the rooks were helping  or at least bossing       ii    we expected to stay certainly a week  and perhaps two weeks  in york   and our luck with railway hotels had been so smiling elsewhere that we  had no other mind than to spend the time at the house into which we all  but stepped from our train  but we had reckoned without our host  as he  was represented by one of a half dozen alert young ladies in the office   who asked how long we expected to stay  and when we expressed a general  purpose of staying indefinitely  said that all her rooms were taken  from the next monday by people who had engaged them long before for  the races  i did not choose to betray my ignorance to a woman  but  i privately asked the head porter what races those were which were  limiting our proposed sojourn  and i am now afraid he had some  difficulty in keeping a head porter s conventional respect for a formal  superior in answering that we had arrived on the eve of doncaster week   then i said   oh yes   and affected the knowledge of doncaster week  which i resolved to acquire by staying somewhere in york till it was  over     but as yet  that friday afternoon  there was no hurry  and  instead of  setting about a search for lodgings at once  we drove up into the town   as soon as we had tea  and visited york minster while it was still  the gray afternoon and not yet the gray evening  i thought the hour  fortunate  and i do not see yet how we could have chosen a better hour  out of the whole twenty four  for the inside or the outside of the  glorious fane  the grandest and beautifulest in all england  as i felt  then and i feel now  if i were put to the question and were forced to  say in what its supreme grandeur and beauty lay  i should perhaps say in  its most ample simplicity  no doubt it is full of detail  but i keep no  sense of this from that mighty interior  with its tree like  clustered  pillars  and its measureless windows  like breadths of stained foliage  in autumnal woodlands  you want the scale of nature for the minster at  york  and i cannot liken it to less than all out doors  some cathedrals   like that of wells  make you think of gardens  but york minster will not  be satisfied with less than an autumnal woodland  where the trees stand  in clumps  with grassy levels about them  and with spacious openings to  the sky  that let in the colored evening light     you could not get lost in it  for it was so free of all such  architectural undergrowth as cumbers the perspectives of some  cathedrals  besides  the afternoon of our visit there were so many other  americans that you could easily have asked your way in your own dialect   we loitered over its lengths and breadths  and wondered at its windows   which were like the gates of sunrise and sunset for magnitude  and  lingered in a sumptuous delay from going into the choir  delighting in  the gray twilight which seemed to gather from the gray walls inward   when suddenly what seemed a metallic curtain was dropped with a clash  and the simultaneous up flashing of electric bulbs inside it  and we  were shut out from the sight but not the sound of the service that  began in the choir  we could not wholly regret the incident  for as  we recalled the like operation of religion in churches of our italian  travel  we were reminded how equally authoritative the church of england  and the church of home were  and how little they adjust their ceremonial  to the individual  how largely to the collective worshipper  you could  come into the minster of york as into the basilica of st  mark at venice  for a silent prayer amid the religious influences of the place  and be  conscious of your oneness with your source  as if there were no  other one  but when the priesthood called you as one of many to your  devotions  it was with the same imperative voice in both  and you must  obey or be cut off from your chance  i suppose it is right  but somehow  the down clashing of that screen of the choir in the minster at york  seemed to exclude us with reproach  almost with ignominy      illustration  york minster  the grandest in all england     we did what we could to repair our wounded self respect  and did not lay  our exclusion up against the minster itself  which i find that i noted  as  scatteringly noble outside   by this i dare say i meant it had not  that artistic unity of which i brought the impression from the inside   they were doing  as they were always doing  every where  with english  cathedrals  something to one of the towers  but this only enhanced  its scattering nobleness  for it left that greatly bescaffolded tower  largely to the imagination  in which it soared sublimer  if anything   than its compeer  most of the streets leading to and from the rather  insufficient  irregular square where the minster stands are lanes  of little houses of the fifteenth and sixteenth  centuries  which  collectively curved in their line  and not only overhung at their second  stories  but bulged outward involuntarily from the weakness of age   they were all quite habitable  and some much later dwellings immediately  surrounding the church were the favorite sojourn  apparently  of such  strangers as could have rooms at the hotels only until the monday of  doncaster week       iii    during those limited days of the week before doncaster  i was constantly  coming back to the minster  which is not the germ of political york  or  hardly religious york  the brave city was a romano british capital and  a romano british episcopal see centuries before the first wooden temple  was built on the site of the present edifice in      i should like to  make believe that we found traces of that simple church in the crypt of  the minster when we went the next morning and were herded through it by  the tenderest of vergers  most of our flock were americans  and we put  our guide to such question in matters of imagination and information  as the patience of a less amiable shepherd would not have borne  many a  tale  true or o ertrue  our verger had  which he told with unction  when  he ascended with us to the body of the church  and said that the stained  glass of the gigantic windows suffered from the depredations of the  mistaken birds which pecked holes in the joints of their panes  i felt  that i had full measure from him  pressed down and running over  i do  not remember why he said the birds should have done this  but it seems  probable that they took the mellow colors of the glass for those of ripe  fruits     for myself  i could not get enough of those windows  in another sort  of famine which ought at this time to have been sated  i was forever  wondering at their grandeur outside and their glory inside  i was glad  to lose my way about the town  for if i kept walking i was sure  sooner  or later  to bring up at the minster  but the last evening of our stay  i made a purposed pilgrimage to it for a final emotion  it was the  clearest evening we had in york  and at half past six the sun was  setting in a transparent sky  which somehow it did not flush with any of  those glaring reds which the vulgarer sorts of sunsets are fond of  but  bathed the air in a delicate suffusion of daffodil light  just tinged  with violet  this was the best medium to see the past of the minster in   and i can see it there now  if i did not then  i followed  or i follow   its veracious history back to the beginning of the seventh century   whence you can look back further still to the earliest christian temples  where the romans worshipped with the britons  whom they had enslaved  and converted  but it was not till     that the little wooden chapel was  built on the site of the minster  to house the rite of the northumbrian  king eadwine s baptism  he felt so happy in his new faith that he  replaced the wooden structure with stone  in the next century it was  burned  but rebuilt by another pious prince  and probably repaired by  yet another after the danes took the city a hundred years later  it  was then in a good state to be destroyed by that devout william the  conqueror  who came to take the saxon world in its sins of guttling  and guzzling  the first norman archbishop reconstructed or restored  the church  and then it began to rise and to spread in glory  nave   transepts  and choir  and pillars and towers  norman and early english   and perpendicular and decorated  till it found itself at last what the  american tourist sees it to day  it suffered from two great fires in  the nineteenth century  the first set by a lunatic who had the fancy of  seeing it burn  but who had only the satisfaction of destroying part of  the roof     it was never richly painted  but the color wanting in the walls and  fretted vault was more than compensated by the mellowed splendors of  the matchless windows  it was  indeed  fit to be the home of much more  secular history than can be associated with it  but not till the end  of the thirteenth century had the minster a patron of its own  when st   william was canonized  and exercised his office  whatever it was  for  two brief centuries  then the cromwell of henry viii  took possession  of it in behalf of the crown  and the saint s charge was practically  abolished  he was even deprived of his head  for the relic was encased  in gold and jewels  and was therefore worth the king s having  who was  most a friend of the reformed religion when it paid best  the later  cromwell  who beat a later king hard by at marston moor  must have  somehow desecrated the minster  though there is no record of any such  fact  a more authentic monument of the religious difficulties of the  times is the pastoral staff  bearing the arms of catharine of braganza   the poor little wife of charles ii   which was snatched from a roman  catholic bishop when  to the high offence of protestant piety  he was  heading a procession in york in       the verger showing us through the  minster was a good protestant  but he held it bad taste in a predecessor  of his  who when leading about a catholic party of sight seers took the  captive staff from its place and shook it in their faces  saying   don t  you wish you had it        iv    there is no telling to what lengths true religion  may rightly not go  i  rather prize the incident as the sole fact concerning the minster which  i could make sure of even after repeated visits  and if i am indebted  for my associations with it  long after the event  to dr  raine s  scholarly and interesting sketch of york history  there is no reason  why the better informed reader should not accompany me in my last visit  fully equipped  i walked slowly all round the structure  and fancied  that i got a new sense of grandeur in the effect of the east window   which was  at any rate  more impressive than the north window  it was  a long walk  almost the measure of such a walk as one should take after  supper for one s health  and it had such incidents as many pauses for  staring up at the many restorations going on  from point to point the  incomparable perpendicular gothic carried the eye to the old gargoyles  of the caves and towers waiting to be replaced by the new gargoyles   which lay in open mouthed grimacing in the grass at the bases of the  church  while i stood noting both  and thinking the chances were that i  should never look on york minster again  and feeling the luxurious pang  of it  a verger in a skull cap was so good as to come to a side door and  parley long and pleasantly with a policeman  the simple local life went  on around  people going to or from supper passed me  kind  vulgar  noises came from the little houses bulging over the narrow  neighboring  streets  there seemed to be the stamping of horses in a stable  and  there was certainly the misaspirated talk about them  i could not have  asked better material for the humble emotions i love  and i was more  than content on my way home to find myself one of the congregation  at the loud devotions of a detachment of the salvation army  after a  battering of drums and a clashing of cymbals and a shouting of hymns   the worship settled to the prayer of a weak brother  who was so long in  supplication that the head exhorter covered a yawn with his hand  and at  the first sign of relenting in the supplicant bade the drums and cymbals  strike up  then  after a hymn  a sister  such a very plain  elderly  sister  with hardly a tooth or an aitch in her head  began to relate her  religious history  it appeared that she had been a much greater sinner  than she looked  and that the mercy shown her had been proportionate   she was vain both of her sins and mercies  poor soul  and in her scrimp  figure  with its ill fitting uniform  heaven knows how long she went on   i was distracted by a clergyman passing on the outside of the ring of  listening women and children  and looking  i chose to think  somewhat  sourly askance at the distasteful ceremonial  i wished to stop him   on his way to the minster  if that was his way  and tell him that so  christianity must have begun  and so the latest form of it must  always begin and work round after ages and ages to the beauty and  respectability his own ritual has  but i now believe this would have  been the greatest impertinence and hypocrisy  for i myself found the  performance before us as tasteless and tawdry as he could possibly have  done  he was going toward the minster  and it would make him forget it   but i was going away from it  perhaps  for the last time  and this loud  side show of religion would make me forget the minster       v    our railway hotel lay a little way out of the town  and after a day s  sight seeing we were to meet or mingle with troops of wholesome looking  workmen whose sturdiness and brightness were a consolation after  the pale debility of labor s looks in sheffield  from the  chocolate factories or the railroad shops  which are the chief  industries of york  they would be crossing the bridge of the ouse  the  famous stream on which the romans had their town  and which suggested to  the anglicans to call their eboracum eurewic  a town on a river  in due  time the danes modified this name to yerik  and so we came honestly by  the name of our own new york  called after the old york  as soon as the  english had robbed the dutch of it  and the king of england had given  the province to his brother the duke of york  both cities are still  towns on rivers  but the ouse is no more an image or forecast of the  hudson than old york is of new york  for that reason  the bridge over  it is not to be compared to our brooklyn bridge  or even to any bridge  which is yet to span the hudson  the difference is so greatly in our  favor that we may well yield our city s mother the primacy in her city  wall  we have ourselves as yet no plantagenet wall  and we have not yet  got a mediaeval gate through which the traveller passes in returning  from the flatiron building to his hotel in the grand central station     we do not begin to have such a hoar antiquity as is articulate in the  mother city  speaking with muted voices from the innumerable monuments  which the earth has yielded from the site of our hotel and its adjacent  railway station  all underground york is doubtless fuller of home than  even bath is  and it has happened that her civilization was much more  largely dug up here than elsewhere when the foundations of the spreading  edifices were laid  the relics are mainly the witnesses of pagan rome   but christianity politically began in york  as it has politically ended  in new york  and doubtless some soldiers of the sixth legion and many of  the british slaves were religiously christians in the ancient metropolis  before constantine was elected emperor there     i have been in many places where history is hospitably at home and is  not merely an unwilling guest  as in our unmemoried land  florence is  very well  venice is not so bad  naples has her long thoughts  and milan  is mediaeval minded  not to speak of genoa  or marseilles  or paris  or  those romantic german towns where the legends  if not the facts  abound   but  after all  for my pleasure in the past  i could not choose any  place before york  you need not be so very definite in your knowledge   the event of constantine s presence and election is so spacious as to  leave no room for particulars in the imagination  and you are so rich in  it that you will even reject them from your thoughts  as you sit in  the close cropped flowery lawn of your hotel garden  try to imagine a  railroad hotel garden in  new  york   on the sunniest of the afternoons  before you are turned out for doncaster week  and  while you watch  a little adventurous american boy climbing over a pile of rock work   realize the most august  the most important fact in the story of the  race as native to the very air you are breathing  where you sit you are  in full view of the minster  which is to say in view of something like  the towers and battlements of the celestial city  or if you wake  very early on a morning still nearer the fatal doncaster week of your  impending banishment  and look out of your lofty windows at the sunrise  reddening the level bars of cloud behind the minster  you shall find it  bulked up against the pearl gray masses of the sunny mist which hangs  in all the intervening trees  and solidifies them in unbroken masses of  foliage  all round your hotel spreads a gridiron of railroad  yet such  is the force of the english genius for quiet that you hear no clatter of  trains  the expresses whir in and out of the station with not more noise  than humming birds  and amid this peace the past has some chance with  modernity  the britons dwell  unmolested by our latter day clamor  in  their wattled huts and dugouts  the romans come and make them slaves and  then christians  and after three or four hundred years send word from  the tiber to the ouse that they can stay no longer  and so leave them  naked to their enemies  the picts and scots and saxons and angles  and  in due course come the ravaging and burning danes  and in due course  still  the murdering and plundering and scorning normans  but all so  quietly  like the humming bird like expresses  with a kind of railway  celerity in the foreshortened retrospect  and after the normans have  crushed themselves down into the mass of the vanquished  and formed the  english out of the blend  there follow the many wars of the successions   of the roses  of the stuarts  with all the intermediate insurrections  and rebellions  in the splendid histories of shakespeare  which are  full of york  the imagination visits and revisits the place  and you are  entreated by mouth of one of his princely personages           i pray you let us satisfy our eyes        with the memorials and things of fame         that do renown this city      where his henrys and richards and margarets and edwards and eleanors  abide still and shall forever abide while the english speech lasts      illustration  bootham bar and the minster       vi    something of all this i knew  and more pretended  with a mounting  indignation at the fast coming doncaster week which was to turn us out  of our hotel  we began our search for other lodgings with what seemed to  be increasing failure  the failure had consolation in it so far as the  sweet regret of people whose apartments were taken could console  they  would have taken us at other hotels for double the usual price  but   when we showed ourselves willing to pay  it proved that they had  no rooms at any price  from house to house  then  we went  at first  vaingloriously  in the spaces about the minster  and then meekly into  any side street  wherever the legend of apartments showed itself in a  transom  at last  the second day  after being denied at seven successive  houses  we found quite the refuge we wanted in the bootham  which means  very much more than the ignorant reader can imagine  our upper rooms  looked on a pretty grassy garden space behind  where there was sun when  there was sun  and in front on the fine old brick dwellings of a most  personable street  with a sentiment of bygone fashion  at the upper end  of it was a famous city gate  bootham bar  namely  with a practicable  portcullis  which we verified at an early moment by going up into  the  chamber over the gate   where it was once worked  and whence its lower  beam  set thick with savage spikes  was dropped  outside the gate there  was a sign in the wall saying that guards were to be had there to guide  travellers through the forest of galtres beyond bootham  and keep them  from the wolves  now woods and wolves and guards are all gone  and  bootham bar is never closed     the upper room is a passageway for people who are walking round the town  on the plantagenet wall  and one morning we took this walk in sunshine  that befitted the sabbath  half the children of york seemed to be taking  it  too  with their good parents  who had stayed away from church to  give them this pleasure  the fathers putting on their frock coats and  top hats  which are worn on no other days in the provincial cities of  england  for a plantagenet wall  that of york is in excellent repair   and it is very clean  so that the children could not spoil their sunday  best by clambering on the parapet  and trying to fall over it  there  was no parapet on the other side  and they could have fallen over that  without trouble  but it would not have served the same purpose  for  under the parapet there were the most alluringly ragged little boys   with untidy goats and delightfully dirty geese  there was no trace of a  moat outside the wall  where pleasant cottages pressed close to it  with their gardens full of bright flowers  at one point there were  far spreading sheep and cattle pens  where there is a weekly market  and  at another the old norman castle which cruel conqueror william built to  hold the city  and which has suffered change  not unpicturesque   into prisons for unluckier criminals  and the assize courts for their  condemnation  from time to time the wall left off  and then we got down   perforce  and walked to the next piece of it  in these pieces we  made the most of the old gates  especially walmgate bar  which has a  barbican  i should be at a loss to say why the barbican should have  commended it so  perhaps it was because we there realized  for the first  time  what a barbican was  i doubt if the reader knows  now  otherwise   i should have preferred monk bar or micklegate bar  as being more like  those i was used to in the theatre  but we came back gladly to bootham  bar  holding that a portcullis was equal any day to a barbican  and  feeling as if we had got home in the more familiar neighborhood     there were small shops in the bootham  thread and needle stores   newspaper stores  and provision stores mainly  which i affected  and  there was one united florist s and fruiterer s which i particularly  liked because of the conversability of the proprietor  he was a stout  man  of a vinous complexion  with what i should call here  where our  speech is mostly uncouth  an educated accent  though with few and  wandering aspirates in it  him i visited every morning to buy for my  breakfast one of those spanish melons which they have everywhere in  england  and which put our native cantaloupes to shame  and we always  fell into a little talk over our transaction of fourpence or sixpence   as the case might be  after i had confided that i was an american  he  said one day   ah  the americans are clever people   then he added    i hope you won t mind my saying it  sir  but i think their ladies are  rather harder than our english ladies  sir       yes   i eagerly assented   how do you mean  sharper  keener       well  not just that  sir       more practical  more business like   i pursued      well  i shouldn t like to say that  sir  but  they seem rather harder   sir  at least  judging from what i see of them in york  sir  rather  harder  sir      we remained not the less friends with that mystery between us  and i  bought my last melon of him on my last morning  when the early september  had turned somewhat sharply chill  that turn made me ask what the winter  was in york  and he boasted it very cold  with ice and snow aplenty   and degrees of frost much like our own  but apparently those york women  resisted it and remained of a tenderness which contrasted to their  advantage with the summer hardness of our women       vii    it was a pleasure  which i should be glad to share with the reader  to  lose one s self in the streets of york  they were all kinds of streets  except straight  and they seemed not to go anywhere except for the  joke of bringing the wayfarer unexpectedly back to  or near  his  starting point and far from his goal  the blame of their vagariousness   if it was a fault  is put upon the danes  who found york when they  captured it very rectangular  for so the romans built it  and so the  angles kept it  but nothing would serve the danes but to crook its  streets and call them gates  so that the real gates of the city have to  be called bars  or else the stranger might take them for streets  if he  asked another wayfarer  he could sometimes baffle the streets  and get  to the point he aimed at  but  whether he did or not  he could always  amuse himself in them  they would take a friendly interest in him   and show him the old houses and churches which the american stranger  prefers  they abound in the poorer sorts of buildings  of course  just  as they do in the poorer sorts of people  but in their simpler courts  and squares and expanses they have often dignified mansions of that  georgian architecture which seems the last word in its way  and which is  known here in our older edifices as there in their newer  some of them  are said to have  richly carved ceilings  wainscoted  panelled rooms   chimneypieces with paintings framed in the over mantel  dentilled  cornices  and pedimented doors   and i could well believe it  as i  passed them with an envious heart  there were gardens behind these  mansions which hung their trees over the spiked coping of their  high shouldered walls and gates  and sequestered i know not what damp  social events in their flowery and leafy bounds      illustration  walmgate bar has a barbican     at times i distinctly wished to know something of the life of york  but  i was not in the way of it  the nearest to an acquaintance i had there   besides my critical fruiterer  was the actor whose name i recognized on  his bills as that of a brave youth who had once dramatized a novel of  mine  and all too briefly played the piece  and who was now to come  to york for a week of shakespeare  perhaps i could not forgive him the  recrudescence  at any rate  i did not try to see him  and there was no  other social chance for me  except as i could buy in for a few glimpses  at the tidy confectioners   where persons of civil condition resorted  for afternoon tea  even to these one could not speak  and i could only  do my best in a little mercenary conversation with the bookseller about  york histories  the bookstores were not on our scale  and generally the  shops in york were not of the modern department type  but were perhaps  the pleasanter for that reason     in my earlier wanderings i made the acquaintance of a most agreeable  market place  stretching the length of two squares  which on a saturday  afternoon i found filled with every manner of bank and booth and  canopied counter  three deep  and humming pleasantly with traffic in  everything one could eat  drink  wear  or read  there seemed as many  book stalls as fruit stalls  what i noted equally with the prettiness  of the abounding flowers was the mild kindness of the market people s  manners and their extreme anxiety to state exactly the quality of the  things they had for sale  they seemed incapable of deceit  but i do  not say they really were so  my own transactions were confined to the  purchase of some golden gage plums  and i advise the reader rather to  buy greengages  the other plums practised the deception in their looks  which their venders abhorred       viii    i wandered in a perfectly contemporary mood through the long ranks and  lanes of the marketplace  and did not know till afterward that at one  end of it  called the pavement  the public executions used to take place  for those great or small occasions which brought folks to the block or  scaffold in the past  i had later some ado to verify the dismal fact  from a cluster of people before a tavern who seemed to be taking bets  for the doncaster week  and i could hardly keep them from booking me  for this horse or that when i merely wanted to know whether it was on a  certain spot the earl of northumberland had his head cut off for leading  a rising against henry iv   or some such execution     what riches of story has not york to browbeat withal the storyless  new yorker who visits her  that henry iv  was he whom i had lately seen  triumphing near shrewsbury in the final battle of the roses  where the  red was so bloodily set above the white  and it was his poetic fancy  to have northumberland  when he bade him come to york  pass through the  gateway on which the head of his son  hotspur harry  was festering  no  wonder the earl led a rising against his liege  who had first mercifully  meant to imprison him for life  and then more mercifully pardoned him   but there seems to have been fighting up and down the centuries from the  beginning  in york  interspersed with praying and wedding and feasting   after the citizens drove out conqueror william s garrison  and earl  waltheof provided against the normans  return by standing at the castle  gate and chopping their heads off with his battle axe as they came  forth  william efficaciously devastated the city and the country as far  as durham  his son william gave it a church  and that  worthy peer    king stephen  a hospital  in his time the archbishop and barons of york  beat the scotch hard by  and the next scotch king had to do homage to  henry ii  at york for his kingdom  henry iii  married his sister at york  to one scotch king and his daughter to that king s successor  edward i   and his queen eleanor honored with their presence the translation of st   william s bones to the minster  edward ii  retreated from his defeat at  bannockburn to york  and edward iii  was often there for a king s  varied occasions of fighting and feasting  weak henry vi  and his wilful  margaret  after their defeat at towton by edward iv   escaped from the  city just in time  and edward entered york under his own father s head  on micklegate bar  richard iii  was welcomed there before his rout and  death at bosworth  and was truly mourned by the citizens  henry vii   wedded elizabeth  the  white rose of york   and afterward visited her  city  mary  queen of scots  was once in hiding there  and her uncouth  son stayed two nights in york on his way to be crowned james i  in  london  his son  charles i   was there early in his reign  and touched  many for the king s evil  later  he was there again  but could not cure  the sort of king s evil which raged past all magic in the defeat of his  followers at marston moor by cromwell  the city yielded to the puritans   whose temperament had already rather characterized it  james ii   as  duke of york  made it his brief sojourn   proud cumberland   returning  from culloden after the defeat of the pretender  visited the city  and received its freedom for destroying the last hope of the stuarts   perhaps the twenty two rebels who were then put to death in york were  executed in the very square where those wicked men thought i was wanting  to play the horses  the reigning family has paid divers visits to the  ancient metropolis  which was the capital of britain before london was  heard of  the old prophecy of her ultimate primacy must make time if  it is to fulfil itself and increase york s seventy two thousand beyond  london s six million       ix    i should be at a loss to say why its english memories haunted my york  less than the roman associations of the place  they form  however   rather a clutter of incidents  whereas the few spreading facts of  hadrian s stay  the deaths of severus and constantius  and the election  of constantine  his son  enlarge themselves to the atmospheric compass  of the place  but leave a roominess in which the fancy may more  commodiously orb about  i was on terms of more neighborly intimacy  with the poor punic emperor than with any one else in york  doubtless  because  when he fell sick  he visited the temple of bellona near  bootham bar  and paid his devotions unmolested  let us hope  by any  prevision of the misbehavior of his son caracalla  whose baths i had  long ago visited at rome  in killing his other son geta  everywhere i  could be an early christian  in company with constantine  in whom the  instinct of political christianity must have begun to stir as soon as he  was chosen emperor  but i dare say i heard the muted tramp of the sixth  legion about the yorkish streets above all other martial sounds because  i stayed as long as doncaster week would let me in the railway hotel   which so many of their bones made room for when the foundations of it  were laid  with those of the adherent station  their bones seem to  have been left there  after the disturbance  but their sepulchres were  respectfully transferred to the museum of the philosophical society  in  the grounds where the ruins of st  mary s abbey rise like fragments  of pensive music or romantic verse  inviting the moonlight and the  nightingale  but  wanting these  make shift with the noonday and the  babies in perambulators neglected by nurse girls reading novels      illustration  st  mary s abbey     the babies and the nurses are not allowed in the museum of antiquities   which is richer in roman remains than any that one sees outside of  italy  there are floors of mosaic  large and perfect  taken from the  villas which people are always digging up in the neighborhood of york   and  from the graves uncovered in the railway excavations  coffins of  lead and stone for civilians  and of rude tiles for the soldiers of the  sixth legion  the slaves were cast into burial pits of tens and twenties  and left to indiscriminate decay till they should be raised in the  universal incorruption  probably the slaves were the earliest christians  at york  certainly the monuments are pagan  as the inmates of the tombs  must have been  some of the monuments bear inscriptions from loving  wives and husbands to the partners they have lost  and some of the stone  coffins are those of children  it is all infinitely touching  and after  two thousand years the heart aches for the fathers and mothers who laid  their little ones away in these hard cradles for their last sleep   faith changes  but constant death remains the same  and life is not very  different in any age  when it comes to the end  the roman exiles who had  come so far to hold my british ancestors in subjection to their alien  rule seemed essentially not only of the same make as me  but the  same civilization  their votive altars and inscriptions to other gods  expressed a human piety of like anxiety and helplessness with ours  and  called to a like irresponsive sky  a hundred witnesses of their mortal  state  jars and vases and simple household utensils  fill the shelves of  the museum  but the most awful  the most beautiful appeal of the past is  in that mass of dark auburn hair which is kept here in a special urn and  uncovered for your supreme emotion  it is equally conjectured to be the  hair of a roman lady or of a british princess  but is of a young girl  certainly  dressed twenty centuries ago for the tomb in which it was  found  and still faintly lucent with the fashionable unguent of the day   and kept in form by pins of jet  one thinks of the little  slender hands  that used to put them there  and of the eyes that confronted themselves  in the silver mirror under the warm shadow that the red gold mass  cast upon the white forehead  this sanctuary of the past was the most  interesting place in that most interesting city of york  and the day of  our first visit a princess of new york sat reading a book in the midst  of it  waiting for the rain to be over  which was waiting for her to  come out and then begin again  we knew her from having seen her at the  station in relation to some trunks bearing her initials and those of  her native city  and she could be about the age of the york princess or  young roman lady whose hair was kept in the urn hard by       x    there is in york a little  old  old church  whose dear and reverend  name i have almost forgotten  if ever i knew it  but i think it is holy  trinity goodramgate  which divides the heart of my adoration with the  minster  we came to it quite by accident  one of our sad september  afternoons  after we had been visiting the guildhall  venetianly  overhanging the canal calm of the ouse  and very worthy to be seen for  its york histories in stained glass  the custodian had surprised us and  the gentlemen of the committee by taking us into the room where they  were investigating the claims of the registered voters to the suffrage   and so  much entertained and instructed  we issued forth  and  passing  by the church in which guy fawkes was baptized  only too ineffectually   we came quite unexpectedly upon holy trinity goodramgate  if that and  not another is indeed its name     it stands sequestered in a little leafy and grassy space of its own   with a wall hardly overlooked on one side by low stone cottages  the  immemorial homes of rheumatism and influenza  the church had the air  of not knowing that it is of perpendicular and decorated gothic  with  a square  high shouldered tower  as it bulks up to a very humble  height from the turf to the boughs overhead  or that it has a nice  girl sketching its doorway  where a few especially favored weddings and  funerals may enter  it is open once a year for service  and when the  tourist will  or can  for the sight of the time mellowed  beautiful  stained glass of its eastward window  the oaken pews are square and  high shouldered  like the low church tower  and  without  the soft  yellow sandstone is crumbling away from the window traceries  the church  did not look as if it felt itself a thousand years old  and perhaps it  is not  but i never was in a place where i seemed so like a ghost of  that antiquity  i had a sense of haunting it  in the inner twilight and  the outer sunlight  where a tender wind was stirring the leaves of its  embowering trees and scattering them on the graves of my eleventh and  twelfth century contemporaries       xi    we chose the sunniest morning we could for our visit to clifford s  tower  which remains witness of the norman castle the conqueror built  and rebuilt to keep the danish anglian roman british town in awe  but  the tower was no part of the original castle  and only testifies of it  by hearsay  that was built by roger de clifford  who suffered death with  his party chief  the earl of lancaster  when edward of york took the  city  and it is mainly memorable as the refuge of the jews whom the  christians had harried out of their homes  they had grown in numbers and  riches  when the jew hate of      broke out in england  as from time  to time the jew hate breaks out in russia now  to much the same cruel  effect  they were followed and besieged in the castle  and  seeing that  they must be captured  they set fire to the place  and five hundred slew  themselves  some that promised to be christians came out and were killed  by their brethren in christ  in new york the christians have grown  milder  and now they only keep the jews out of their clubs and their  homes      illustration  clifford s tower     the clifford tower leans very much to one side  so that as you ascend it  for the magnificent view from the top you have to incline yourself the  other way  as you do in the tower of pisa  to help it keep its balance   the morning of our visit  so gay in its forgetfulness of the tragical  past  we found the place in charge of an old soldier  an irishman who  had learned  as custodian  a professional compassion for those poor jews  of nine hundred years ago  and  being moved by our confession of our  nationality  owned to three  nevvies  in new haven  so small is the  world and so closely knit in the ties of a common humanity and a common  citizenship  native and adoptive     the country around york looked so beautiful from clifford s tower that  we would not be satisfied till we had seen it closer  and we chose a  bright  cool september afternoon for our drive out of the town and over  the breezy  high levels which surround it  the first british capital  could hardly have been more nobly placed  and one could not help  grieving that the ouse should have indolently lost york that early  dignity by letting its channel fill up with silt and spoil its  navigation  the thames managed better for york s upstart rival london   and yet the ouse is not destitute of sea or river craft  these were of  both steam and sail  and i myself have witnessed the energy with which  the reluctance of the indolent stream is sometimes overcome  i do not  suppose that anywhere else  when the wind is low  is a vessel madly  hurled through the water at a mile an hour by means of a rope tied  to its mast and pulled by a fatherly old horse under the intermittent  drivership of two boys whom he could hardly keep to the work  i loved  the banks of a stream where one could see such a triumph of man over  nature  and where nature herself was so captivating  all that grassy  and shady neighborhood seemed a public promenade  where on a sunday one  could see the lower middle classes in their best and brightest  and  it had for all its own the endearing and bewitching name of ings  why  cannot we have ings by the hudson side                                                         two yorkish episodes      certainly i had not come to york  as certainly i would not have gone  anywhere  for battle fields  but becoming gradually sensible in that  city that the battle of marston moor was fought a few miles away  and  my enemy charles i  put to one of his worst defeats there  i bought a  third class ticket and ran out to the place one day for whatever emotion  awaited me there       i    at an english station you are either overwhelmed with transportation   or you are without any except such as you were born with  and at the  station for marston moor i asked for a fly in vain  but it was a most  walkable afternoon  and the pleasant road into the region which the  station master indicated as that i was seeking invited the foot by its  level stretch  sometimes under wayside trees  but mostly between open  fields  newly reaped and still yellow with their stubble  or green with  the rowen clover  sometimes it ran straight and sometimes it curved   but it led so rarely near any human habitation that one would rather not  have met any tramps beside one s self on it  presently i overtook one  a  gentle old farm wife  a withered blonde  whom i helped with the bundles  she bore in either hand  in the hope that she could tell me whether i  was near marston moor or not  but she could tell me only  what may have  been of higher human interest  that her husband had the grass farm of  a hundred and fifty acres  which we were coming to  for seventy five  pounds a year  and they had their own cattle  sheep  and horses  and  were well content with themselves  she excused herself for not knowing  more than vaguely of the battle field  as not having been many years  in the neighborhood  and being now come to a gate in the fields  she  thanked me and took her way up a grassy path to the pleasant farmhouse i  saw in the distance     it must have been about this time that it rained  having shone long  enough for english weather  and it hardly held up before i was overtaken  by a friendly youth on a bicycle  whom i stayed with the question  uppermost in my mind  he promptly got off his wheel to grapple with the  problem  he was a comely young fellow  an artisan of some sort from  a neighboring town  and he knew the country well  but he did not know  where my lost battle field was  he was sure that it was near by  but he  was sure there was no monument to mark the spot  then we parted friends   with many polite expressions  and he rode on and i walked on     for a mile and more i met no other wayfarer  and as i felt that it was  time to ask for marston moor again  i was very glad to be overtaken by  a gentleman driving in a dog cart  with his pretty young daughter on  the wide seat with him  he halted at sight of the elderly pilgrim  and  hospitably asked if he could not give him a lift  alleging that there  was plenty of room  he was interested in my search  which he was not  able definitely to promote  but he believed that if i would drive with  him to his place i could find the battle field  and  anyhow  i could get  a trap back from the the sun  i pleaded the heat i was in from walking   and the danger for an old fellow of taking cold in a drive through the  cool air  and then  as old fellows do  we bantered each other about  our ages  each claiming to be older than the other  and the kind  sweet  young girl sat listening with that tolerance of youth for the triviality  of age which is so charming  when he could do no more  he said he was  sorry  and wished me luck  and drove on  and i being by this time tired  with my three miles  tramp  took advantage of a wayside farmhouse  the  first in all the distance  and went in and asked for a cup of tea     the farm wife  who came in out of her back garden to answer my knock   pleaded regretfully that her fire was down  but she thought i could  get tea at the next house  and she was very conversable about the  battle field  she did not know just where it was  but she was sure it  was quite a mile farther on  and at that i gave up the hope of it along  with the tea  this is partly the reader s loss  for i have no doubt  i could have been very graphic about it if i had found it  but as for  marston moor  i feel pretty certain that if it ever existed it does not  now  a moor  as i understand  implies a sort of wildness  but nothing  could be more domestic than the peaceful fields between which i had come  so far  and now easily found my way back to the station  easily  i say   but there was one point where the road forked  though i was sure it  had not forked before  and i felt myself confronted with some sort   any sort  of exciting adventure  by taking myself firmly in hand  and  saying   it was yonder to the left where i met my kind bicycler  and we  vainly communed of my evanescent battle field   and so keeping on  i got  safely to the station with nothing more romantic in my experience than a  thrilling apprehension       ii    i quite forgot marston moor in my self gratulation and my recognition  of the civility from every one which had so ineffectively abetted my  search  simple and gentle  how hospitable they had all been to my vain  inquiry  and how delicately they had forborne to visit the stranger  with the irony of the average american who is asked anything  especially  anything he does not know  i went thinking that the difference was a  difference between human nature long mellowed to its conditions  and  human nature rasped on its edges and fretted by novel circumstances to a  provisional harshness  i chose to fancy that unhuman nature sympathized  with the english mood  in the sheep bleating from the pastures i heard  the note of wordsworth s verse  and by the sky  hung in its low  blue with rough  dusky clouds  i was canopied as with a canvas of  constable s     it was the more pity  then  that at the station a shooting party   approaching from the other quarter with their servants and guns and  dogs  and their bags of hares and partridges  should have given english  life another complexion to the wanderer so willing to see it always  rose color  the gunners gained the station platform first  and at once  occupied the benches  strewing all the vacant places with their still  bleeding prey  i did not fail of the opportunity to see in them the  arrogance of class  which i had hitherto so vainly expected  and i  disabled their looks by finding them as rude as their behavior  how  different they were from the kind bicycler  or the gentleman in the  dog cart  or either one of the farm wives who sorrowed so civilly not to  know where my lost battle field was     in england  it is always open to the passenger to enforce a claim to  his share of the public facilities  but i chose to go into the licensed  victualler s next the station and sit down to a peaceable cup of tea  rather than contest a place on that bloody benching  and so i made the  acquaintance of an interior out of literature  such as my beloved thomas  hardy likes to paint  on a high backed rectangular settle rising against  the wall  and almost meeting in front of the comfortable range  sat a  company of rustics  stuffing themselves with cold meat  washed down with  mugs of ale  and cozily talking  they gained indefinitely in my interest  from being served by a lame woman  with a rhythmical limp  and i hope it  was not for my demerit that i was served apart in the chillier parlor   when i should have liked so much to stay and listen to the rustic tale  or talk  the parlor was very depressingly papered  but on its walls i  had the exalted company of his majesty the king  their royal highnesses  the prince and princess of wales  the late premier  the marquis of  salisbury  and  for no assignable reason except a general fitness for  high society  the twelve apostles in da vinci s  last supper   together  with an appropriate view of york minster       iii    i do not pretend this search for the battle field of marston moor was  the most exciting episode of my stay in york  in fact  i think it  was much surpassed in a climax of dramatic poignancy incident to our  excursion to bishopsthorpe  down the ouse  on one of the cosey little  steamers which ply the stream without unreasonably crowding it against  its banks  it was a most silvery september afternoon when we started  from the quay at york  and after escaping from embarkment on a boat  going in the wrong direction  began  with no unseemly swiftness  to  scuttle down the current  it was a perfect voyage  as perfect as any i  ever made on the mississippi  the ohio  the st  lawrence  or the hudson   on steamers in whose cabins our little boat would have lost itself  we  had a full but not crowded company of passengers  overflowing into  a skiff at our stern  in which a father and mother  with three women  friends  preferred the high excitement of being towed to bishopsthorpe   where it seemed that the man of the party knew the gardener  with each  curve of the river and with each remove we got the city in more and more  charming retrospective  till presently its roofs and walls and spires  and towers were lost in the distance  and we were left to the sylvan  or pastoral loveliness of the low shores  here and there at a pleasant  interval from the river a villa rose against a background of rounded  tree tops  with lombardy poplars picking themselves out before it  but  for the most part the tops of the banks  with which we stood even on  our deck  retreated from the waterside willows in levels of meadow land   where white and red cows were grazing  and now and then young horses  romping away from groups of their elders  it was all dear and kind and  sweet  with a sort of mid western look in its softness  as the english  landscape often has   and the mud banks were like those of my native  ohio valley rivers  the effect was heightened  on our return  by an  aged and virtuously poor  to all appearance  flageolet and cornet band   playing   way down upon the suwanee river   while the light played in   ditties no tone  over the groves and pastures of the shore  and the  shadows stretched themselves luxuriously out as if for a long night s  sleep  there has seldom been such a day since i began to grow old  a  soft september gale ruffled and tossed the trees finely  and a subtle  italian quality mixed with the american richness of the sunshiny air  so  that i thought we reached bishopsthorpe only too soon  and i woke from a  pleasant reverie to be told that the steamer could not land with us  but  we must be taken ashore in the small boat which we saw putting out for  us from its moorings  to this day i do not know why the steamer could  not land  but perhaps the small boat had a prescriptive right in the  matter  at any rate  it was vigorously manned by a woman  who took  tuppence from each of us for her service  and presently earned it by the  interest she showed in our getting to the archbishop s palace  or villa   the right way      illustration  york as seen from the river     so we went round by an alluring road to its forking  where  looking up  to the left  we could see a pretty village behind lombardy poplars   and coming down toward us in a victoria for their afternoon drive   two charmingly dressed ladies  with bright parasols  and looking very  county family  as we poor americans imagine such things out of english  fiction  we entered the archiepiscopal grounds through a sympathetic  gothic screen  as i will call the overture to the gothic edifice in my  defect of architectural terminology  though perhaps gateway would be  simpler  and found ourselves in the garden  and in the company of  those people we had towed down behind our steamer  they were with  their friend  the gardener  and  claiming their acquaintance as  fellow passengers  we made favor with him to see the house  the  housekeeper  or some understudy of hers  who received us  said the  family were away  but she let us follow her through  that is more than  i will let the reader do  for i know the duty of the cultivated american  to the intimacies of the gentle english life  it is only with the simple  life that i ever make free  there  i own  i have no scruple  but i will  say  with my back turned conscientiously to the interior  that nothing  could be lovelier than the outlook from the dining room  and the whole  waterfront of the house  on the wavy and willowy ouse  and that i would  willingly be many times an archbishop to have that prospect at all my  meals       iv    we despatched our visit so promptly that we got back to our boat woman s  cottage a full hour before our steamer was to call for us  she had an  afternoon fire kindled in her bright range  from the oven of which came  already the odor of agreeable baking  upon this hint we acted  and  asked if tea were possible  it was  and jam sandwiches as well  or if  we preferred buttered tea cake  with or without currants  to jam  sandwiches  there would be that presently  we preferred both  and we sat  down in that pleasant parlor kitchen  and listened  till the tea cake  came out of the oven and was split open and buttered smoking hot  to  a flow of delightful and instructive talk  for our refection we paid  sixpence each  but for our edification we are still  and hope ever to  be  in debt  our hostess was of a most cheerful philosophy  such as  could not be bought of most modern philosophers for money  the flour for  our tea cakes  she said  was a shilling fivepence a stone   and not too  much for growing and grinding it  and all   every week day morning she  rose at half past four  and got breakfast for her boys  who then rode  their bicycles  or  in the snow  walked  all the miles of our voyage  into york  where they worked in the railway shops  no  they did not  belong to any union  the railway men did not seem to care for it  only a   benefit union      she kept the house for her family  and herself ready to answer every  hail from the steamer  but in her mellow english content  which was not  stupid or sodden  but clever and wise  it was as if it were she  rather  than the archbishop  whose nature expressed itself in a motto on one  of the palace walls   blessed be the lord who loadeth us with blessings  every day      when the range  warming to its work  had made her kitchen parlor a  little too hot to hold us  she hospitably suggested the river shore as  cooler  where she knew a comfortable log we could sit on  thither she  presently followed when the steamer s whistle sounded  and held her  boat for us to get safely in  the most nervous of our party offered  the reflection  as she sculled us out into the stream to overhaul the  pausing steamer  that she must find the ferry business very shattering  to the nerves  and she said      yes  but it s nothing to a murder case i was on  once       oh  what murder  what murder   we palpitated back  and both of us  forgot the steamer  so that it almost ran us down  while our ferrywoman  began again      a man shot a nurse  there  throw that line  will you      but he  who ought to have thrown the line for her  in his distraction  let her drop her oar and throw the line herself  and then we scrambled  aboard without hearing any more of the murder     this is the climax i have been working up to  and i call it a fine one   as good as a story to be continued ever ended an instalment with                                                         a day at doncaster and an hour out of durham      the doncaster races lured us from our hotel at york  on the first day   as i had dimly foreboded they would  in fact  if there had been no lure   i might have gone in search of temptation  for in a world where sins are  apt to be ugly  a horse race is so beautiful that if one loves beauty  he can practise an aesthetic virtue by sinning in that sort  so i  made myself a pretence of profit as well as pleasure  and in going to  doncaster i feigned the wish chiefly to compare its high event with that  of saratoga  i had no association with the place save horse racing  and  having missed ascot and derby day  i took my final chance in pursuit  of knowledge  i said to myself   not mere amusement   and set out for  doncaster unburdened by the lightest fact concerning the place       i    i learned nothing of it when there  but i have since learned  from  divers trustworthy sources  that doncaster is the danum of antoninus and  the dona ceaster of the saxons  and that it is not only on the line of  the northeastern railway  but also on that famous watling street which  from the earliest saxon time has crossed the british continent from sea  to sea  and seems to impress most of the cities north and south into a  conformity with its line  like a map of the straightest american railway  routes     unless my ignorance has been abused  nothing remarkable has happened  at doncaster in two thousand years  but this is itself a distinction in  that eventful england where so many things have happened elsewhere   it is the market town of a rich farming region  and has notable  manufactures of iron and brass  of sacking and linen  of spun flax and  of agricultural machines and implements  otherwise  it is important only  for its races  which began there three hundred years ago  and especially  for its st  leger day  of which lieutenant general st  leger became the  patron saint in       though he really established his day two years  earlier     doncaster is a mighty pleasant  friendly  rather modern  and  commonplacely american looking town  with two story trams gently ambling  up and down its chief avenues  in the leisurely english fashion  and  all of more or less arrival and departure at the race grounds  in our  company the reader will have our appetites for lunch  and if he will  take his chance with us in the first simple place away from the station   he will help us satisfy them very wholesomely and agreeably at boards  which seem festively set up for the occasion  and spread with hot  roast beef and the plain vegetables which accompany the national dish  in its native land  or he can have the beef cold  or have cold lamb or  chicken cold  his fellow lunchers will be  as he may like well enough  to fancy  of somewhat lower degree than himself  but they will all seem  very respectable  and when they come out together  they will all be  equalized in the sudden excitement which has possessed itself of the  street  and lined the curbstones up and down with spectators  their  bodies bent forward  and their faces turned in the direction of the  station       ii    the excitement is caused by the coming of the king  and i wish that i  could present that event in just its sincere unimpressiveness  i have  assisted at several such events on the continent  where  especially in  germany  they are heralded as they are in the theatre  with a blare of  trumpets  and a sensation in the populace and the attendant military  little short of an ague fit  there  as soon as the majesties mount into  their carriages from the station  they drive off as swiftly as their  horses can trot  and their subjects  who have been waiting for hours to  see them  make what they can of a meagre half minute s glimpse of  them  but how different was the behavior of that easy going majesty of  england  as soon as i heard that he was coming  i perceived how anxious  i had been in the half year of my english sojourn to see him  and how  bitterly i should have been disappointed to leave his realms without it   all kings are bad  i knew that well enough  but i also knew that some  kings are not so bad as others  and i had been willing to accept at  their face the golden opinions of this king  which  almost without  exception  his lieges seemed to hold  of course it is not hard to think  well of a king if you are under him  just as it is not hard to think  ill of him if you are not under him  but there is no use being bigotedly  republican when there is nothing to be got by it  and i own the fact  that his subjects like him willingly  probably no man in his kingdom  understands better than edward vii  that he is largely a form  and that  the more a form he is the more conformable he is to the english ideal  of a monarch  but no englishman apparently knows better than he when to  leave off being a form and become a man  and he has endeared himself to  his people from time to time by such inspirations  he is reputed on all  hands to be a man of great good sense  if he is ever fooled it is not by  himself  but by the system which he is no more a part of than the least  of his subjects  if he will let a weary old man or a delicate woman  stand indefinitely before him  he is no more to blame for that than for  speaking english with a trace of german in his  th  sounds  he did not  invent his origins or his traditions  personally  having had it out with  life  he is as amiable and as unceremonious as a king may be  he shares   as far as he can  the great and little interests of his people  he has  not  so far as noted  the gifts of some of his sisters  but he has much  of his mother s steadfast wisdom  and his father s instinct for the  right side in considerable questions  and he has his father s prescience  of the psychological moment for not bothering  of course  he is a  fetish  no englishman can deny that the kingship is an idolatry  but  he is a fetish with an uncommon share of the common man s divinity   the system which provides him for the people provides them the best  administration in the world  always naturally in the hands of their  superiors  social and political  but we could be several times rottener  than we administratively are  and still be incalculably reasonabler  as  republicans  than those well governed monarchists      illustration  durham cathedral  northwest view     some of us are apt to forget the immense advantage which we have of the  monarchical peoples in having cast away the very name of king  for with  the name goes the nature of royalty and all that is under and around it   but because we are largely a fond and silly folk  with a false conceit  of ourselves and others  we like to make up romances about the favor in  which thrones  municipalities  and powers hold us  once it was the tsar  of russia who held us dear  and would do almost anything for americans   now it is the king of england who is supposed rather to prefer us to his  own people  and to delight to honor us  we attribute to him a feeling  which a little thought would teach  us was wholly our own  and which  would be out of nature if not out of reason with him  he is a man of  sense  and not of sentiment  and except as a wise politician he could  have no affection for a nation whose existence denies him  he is very  civil to americans  it is part of a constitutional king s business to be  civil to every one  but he is probably not sentimental about us  and we  need not be sentimental about him     he looked like a man of sense  and not like a man of sentiment  that  day as he drove through the doncaster street on his way to the sport he  loves beyond any other sport  he sat with three other gentlemen on the  sidewise seats of the trap  preceded by outriders  which formed the  simple turnout of the greatest prince in the world  he was at the end on  the right  and he showed fully as stout as he was  in the gray suit he  wore  while he lifted his gray top hat now and then  bowing casually   almost absently  to the spectators fringing  not too deeply  the  sidewalks  he was very  very stout  even after many seasons of  marienbad  and after the sufferings he had lately undergone  and he  was quite like the pictures and effigies of him  down to those on the  postage stamps  he has a handsome face  still bearded in the midst of a  mostly clean shaving nation  and with the white hairs prevalent on  the cheeks and temples  his head is bald atop  though hardly from the  uneasiness of wearing a crown     it was difficult to realize him for what he was  and in the unmilitary  keeping of a few policemen  he was not of the high histrionic presence  that those german majesties were  the good natured crowd did not strain  itself in cheering  though it seemed to cheer cordially  and it did  not stay long after the trap tooled comfortably away  i then addressed  myself to a little knot of railway servants who lingered talking  and  asked them what some carriages were still waiting for at the door of the  station  and one of them answered with a lightness you do not expect  in england   oh  lord this  and lady that  and the hon  mr   i don t know what s his name   the others laughed at this ribald satire  of the upper classes  and i thought it safer to follow the king to the  races lest i should hear worse things of them       iii    the races were some miles away  and when we got to the tracks we did  not find their keeping very different from that of the saratoga tracks   although the crowd was both smarter and shabbier  and it had got to the  place through a town of tents and sheds  and a population of hucksters  and peddlers  giving an effect of permanency to the festivity such as  a solemnity of ours seldom has  when we bought our tickets we found  in  the familiarity with the event expected of us  that there was no one to  show us to our places  but by dint of asking we got to the grand stand   and mounted to our seats  which  when we stood up from them  commanded a  wholly satisfactory prospect of the whole field     i do not know the dimensions of the doncaster track  or how far they  exceed those of the saratoga track  possibly one does not do its extent  justice because there is no track at doncaster  there is nothing but a  green turf  with a certain course railed off on it  i hope the reader  will be as much surprised as i was to realize that the sport of  horse racing in england gets its name of turf from the fact that the  races are run on the grass  and not on the bare ground  as with us  we  call the sport the turf  too  but that is because in this  as in so many  other things  we lack incentive and invention  and are fondly colonial  and imitative  we ought to call it the dirt  for that is what it is with  us  as a spectacle  the racing lacks the definition in england which  our course gives  and when it began  i missed the relief into which our  track

 where they seem born to it  if not of it  the  crowd thickened in english bloom and bulk  which is always fine to see   and bubbled over with the babble of multitudinous voices  crossed with  the

proud of having guessed as winner the  horse next to the winner at the first race  it was coming pretty  close  by the end of the third race he had softened into something like  confidence toward me  certainly into conversability  such was the effect  of my being a dead game sport  or looking it  but how account for the  trustfulness of the young woman on my other hand who wore her gold watch  outside her dress  and who turned to the elderly stranger for sympathy  in a certain supreme moment  this was when the crowd below crumpled  suddenly together like the crushing of paper and the sense of something  tragically mysterious in the distance clarified itself as the death of  one of the horses  it had dropped from heart break in its tracks  as if  shot  and presently a string of young men and boys came dragging to some   spoliarium  the long  slender body of the pretty creature over the turf  which its hoofs had beaten a moment before  then it was that the girl   with the watch on her breast  turned and asked   isn t it sad       illustration  finchale priory       iv    she was probably not the daughter of a hundred earls  but there must  have been some such far descended fair among the ladies who showed  themselves from time to time in the royal paddock across a little space  from our grand stand  the enclosure has no doubt a more technical  name  which i would call it by if i knew it  for i do not wish to be  irreverent  but paddock is very sporty  and it must serve my occasion   the king never showed himself there at all  though much craned round for  and eagerly expected  but ladies and gentlemen moved about in the close   and stood and talked together  very tall people  very easily straight  and well set up  very handsome  and very amiable looking  they may have  been really kind and good  or they may have looked so to please the  king and keep his spirits up  i did not then  but i do now  realize that  these were courtiers  such as one has always read of  and were of very  historical quality in their attendance on the monarch  i trust it will  not take from the dignity of the fact if i note that several of the  courtiers wore derby hats  and one was in a sack coat and a topper  i  am not sure what the fairer reader will think if i tell that one of the  ladies had on a dress with a white body and crimson skirt and sleeves   and a vast black picture hat  and wore it with a charming air of  authority     the weather  in the excitement of the races  had not known whether it  was raining or not  but we feared its absent mindedness  and at the end  of the third race we went away  it is not well to trust an english day  too far  this had begun with brilliant sunshine  but it dimmed as it  wore on  and we could not know that it was keeping for us the surprise  of a very refined sunset  my memory does not serve as to just how we had  got out to the race ground  i think  from our being set down at the very  gate  that it was by hansom or by fly  but now we promised ourselves to  walk back to town  we did not actually do so  we went back most of the  way by tram  but we were the firmer about walking at the outset  because  we presently found ourselves in a lane of gypsy tents  where there was  an alluring sight and smell of frying fish and potatoes  in the midst of  the refection  you could have your fortune told  very favorably  for a  very little money  all up and down this happy avenue there went girls of  several dozen sizes and ages  crying a particular kind of taffy  proper  to the day and place  and never to be had on any other day in any other  place     we had an hour before train time  and we thought we would go and see  the parish church of doncaster  which we had read was worth seeing   our belief was confirmed by a group of disappointed ladies in the  churchyard  who said it was a most beautiful church inside  but that  they had not seen it because it was shut  we proved the fact by trying  the door  and then we came away consoling ourselves with the scoff that  it was probably closed for the races  at the bookseller s  where we  stopped to buy some photographs of the interior of the church we had not  seen  we lamented our disappointment  and the salesman said   perhaps  it was closed for the races   so our joke seemed to turn earnest  and on  reflection it did not surprise us in that england of close knit unities  where people and prince are of one texture in their pleasures and  devotions  and the church is hardly more national than the turf       v    at durham  which was my next excursion from york  i cannot claim   therefore  that my mission was more serious because it almost solely  concerned the church  or that it was more frivolous at doncaster  where  it almost solely concerned the turf  my train started in a fine mist  that turned to sun  but not before it had shown me with the local color   which a gray light lends everything  a pack of hounds crossing a field  near the track with two huntsmen at their heels  they were not chasing   but running leisurely  and with their flower like  loose spread over the  green  and the pink coated hunters on their brown mounts  they afforded  a picture as vivid and of as perfect semblance to all my visions of  fox hunting as i could have asked  i had been hoping that i might see  something of the famous sport  almost as english as the church or the  turf  and there  suddenly and all unexpectedly  the sight fully and  satisfyingly was  now  indeed  i felt that my impression of english  society was complete  and that i might go home and write novels of  english high life  and do something to redeem myself a little from the  disgrace i had fallen into with my fellow plebeians by always writing  of common americans  like themselves  and never  grandes dames  or ideal  persons  or people in the best society     but i did not want to go home at once  or turn back from going to durham  through that pleasant landscape  where the mist hung between the trees  which seemed themselves only heavier bulks of mist  the wheat in some  of the fields was still uncut  and in others  where it had been gathered  into sheaves  the rooks by hundreds were noisily gleaning in the track  of the reapers  from this conventionally english keeping  i passed  suddenly to the sight of the gaunt  dry  gravelly bed of a wide river   such as i had known in central italy  or the middle west at home  and i  realized once again that england is no island of one simple complexion   but is a condensed continent  with all continental varieties of feature  in it  you must cover thousands and thousands of miles in our tedious  lengths and breadths for the beauties and sublimities of scenery which  you shall gather from fewer hundreds in england  i have no doubt they  have even volcanoes there  but i did not see any  probably because the  english are so reticent  and hate to make a display of any sort       vi    it is because they are so  or possibly because of my ignorance  that i  did not know or at all imagine how magnificent the cathedral of durham  is  or what a matchless seat it has on the bluffs of the river  with  depths of woods below its front  tossing in the rich chill of the  september wind  as it takes flight for the heavens  to which its  business is to invite the thought  it seems to carry the earth with it   for if you climb those noble heights  you find your feet still on the  ground  in a most stately space of open level between the cathedral and  its neighbor castle  which alone could be worthy of its high company     the castle is tudor  but the cathedral is beyond all other english  cathedrals  i believe  norman  though to the naked eye it looks so  gothic  and probably is  here i will leave the reader with any pictures  or memories of it which he happens to have  for i have always held it  a sin to try describing architecture  or if not a sin  a bore  what  chiefly remains to me of my impression of durham cathedral is   strangely enough  an objection  i did not like those decorated pillars   alternating with the clustered columns of the interior  and i do not  suppose i ever shall  the spiral furrows  the zigzag and lozenge figures  chiselled in their surfaces  weakened them to the eye and seemed to  trifle with their proud bulk     but to the castle of durham i have no objection whatever  i should like  to live in it  as i should in all other tudor houses  great or small   that i saw  where  as i am constantly saying  a high ideal of comfort  is realized  it is almost as nobly placed as the cathedral  and it is  approached by a very stately courtyard  of like spacious effect with the  cathedral piazza  inside it there is a kitchen of the sixteenth century   with a company of neat serving maids  too comely and young to be   perhaps  of the same period  that gives the tourist a high sense of the  luxury in which the bishop of durham and the judges of the assize courts  live when they are residents in the castle  one sees their apartments   dim and rich  and darkly furnished  but not gloomily  both where they  sleep and where they eat  and flatteringly envies them in a willingness  for the moment to be a judge or a bishop for the sake of such a fit  setting  there is also a fine crypt  with a fine dining hall and a black  staircase of ancient oak  and a gallery with classic busts  and other  pictures worthy of wonder  let alone a history from the time of william  the conqueror  who first fancied a castle where it stands  down to the  present day  the memory of such successive guests as the empress matilda  and henry ii  her son  king john  henry iii   edwards i   ii   and iii    queen philippa  henry vi   and james i   and charles i   and edward  vii   abides in the guidebook  and may be summoned from its page to  the chambers of the beautiful old place by any traveller intending  impressions for literary use from a medieval environment in perfect  repair       vii    one must be hard to satisfy if one is not satisfied with durham castle   and its interior contented me as fully as the exterior of the cathedral   i went a walk  after leaving the castle  for a further feast of the  cathedral from the paths along the shelving banks of the beautiful  weare  there  at a certain point  i met a studious looking gentleman who  i am sure must have been a professor of durham university hard by  and  i asked him  with due entreaty for pardon   what river was that   he  quelled the surprise he must have felt at my ignorance and answered  gently   the weare    ah  to be sure  the weare   i said  and thanked  him  and longed for more talk with him  but felt myself so unworthy that  i had not the face to prompt him further  he passed  and then i met a  man much more of my own kind  if not probably so little informed  that  rich  chill gale was still tossing and buffeting the tree tops  and he  made occasion of this to say   this is a cold wynd a blowin   mister     it is  rather   i assented   i was think in    he observed from an  apparent generalization   that i wished i was at home   then he suddenly  added   help a poor man   i was not wholly surprised at the climax   and i offered him  provisionally  a penny   will that do   he hesitated  perceptibly  then he allowed  with a subtle reluctance   yes  that ll  do   and so passed on to satisfy  i hope  the wish he thought he had      illustration  durham cathedral  its matchless seat on the bluffs of the  river     i pursued my own course  as far as the bridge which spans the weare near  a most picturesque mill  and then i stopped a kindly looking workman  and asked him whether he thought i could find a fly or cab anywhere near  that would take me into the town  he answered  briefly but consistently  with his looks   ah doot   and as he owned that it was a long way to  town  i let his doubt decide me to go back to the station     i felt that i ought to have driven from there into the town  and seen  it  and taken to york a later train than the one i had in mind  in the  depravity induced by my neglect of this plain duty  i went  with my  third class return ticket conscious in my pocket  into the first class  refreshment room  and had tea there  as if i had been gentry at the very  least  and possibly nobility  then  having a good deal of time still  on my hands  i loitered over the book stall of the station  and stole a  passage of conversation with a kindly clergyman whom i found looking at  the pretty shilling editions filling the cases  i said  how nice it was  to have hazlitt in that green cloth  and he said  yes  but he held for  gibbon in leather  and just then his train came in and he ran off to  it  and left me to my guilt in not having gone to see durham  it was now  twilight  and too late  but there the charming old town still is  and  will long remain  i hope  with its many memories of war and peace  for  whoever will visit it  certainly there had been no lack of adventures in  my ample hour  it was as charming to weave my conjectures  about the  two gentlemen with whom i had so barely spoken  as to have carried  my acquaintance with them further  and i cannot see how it would have  profited me to know more even of that fellow man who  in the cold wynd  a blowing  had just been thinking he wished he was at home                                                         the mother of the american athens      it was fit that on our way to boston we should pause in passing through  cambridge  that was quite as we should have done at home  and i can only  wish now that we had paused longer  though every moment that kept us  from boston  if it had been anywhere but in england  would have been a  loss  there  it was all gain  and all joy  the gay september   th  that we went this divine journey  my companion was that companionable  archaeologist who had guided my steps in search of the american origins  in london  and who was now to help me follow the pilgrim fathers over  the ground where they sojourned when they were only the pilgrim sons   at divers places on the way  after we left london  he pointed out some  scene associated with american saints or heroes  we traversed the region  that george william curtis  people came from  hard by roxburgh  and  eliot s  the apostle to the indians  again we skirted the ralph waldo  emerson country  with its big market town of bishop s stortford  and  beyond ely  where we stopped for the cathedral and a luncheon  not  unworthy of it  at the station  he startled me from a pleasant drowse i  had fallen into in our railway carriage  with the cry   there  that is  where captain john smith was born    where  where   i implored too late   looking round the compartment everywhere   back where those chickens  were        i    that was the nearest i came to seeing one of the most famous virginian  origins  but you cannot see everything in england  there are too many  things  and if the truth must be known i cared more for the natural  features than the historical facts of the landscape  the country was  flat  and a raw green  as it should be in that raw air  under that  dun sky  with sheep hardily biting the short tough pasturage under the  imbrowning oaks and elms  and the olive graying willows  beside the  full  still streams scarce wetter than the ground they dreamed through     we did not reach boston until six o clock  when the day was already  waning  and the stump of st  botolph s church stood dim against the sky   it was a long drive through the suburban streets from the station to the  hotel  which we found full  and which with its crazy floors touched the  fancy as full of something besides guests  but it was well for us so   because across the market place  which forms the chief public square  of boston  was a far better hotel  where we were welcomed to the  old fashioned ideal of the english inn  such as i did not so nearly  realize anywhere else  the ideal was a little impaired by the electric  light in our bedrooms  but it was not a very brilliant electric light   and there was a damp cold in the corridors which allowed no doubt of its  genuineness  in the dining room  which was also the reading room  there  was an admirable image of a fire in the grate  and a prevailing warmth  and brightness which cheered the heart of exile  when we presently had  dinner  specialized for us by certain differences from that of two other  travellers  there seemed nothing more to ask  except the conversation of  our companions  and this we duly had  quite as if we were four wayfarers  met there in a book  one of these gentlemen proved a solicitor from  bath  and that made me feel more at home  knowing and loving bath as i  did  it did not matter that in trying for some mutual acquaintance  there we failed  our good will was everything  and the solicitor was  intelligent and agreeable  the other gentleman  tall  dark  of urbane  stateliness  was something more  in the touch of oriental suavity  which  more than his nose  betrayed him  and it appeared  in delightful  suggestion of the old time commercial intimacy of the dutch and english  coasts  that he was from holland  and next morning at breakfast he  developed a large valise  which i now think held samples  if he was a  dutch jew  he was probably a spanish jew by descent  and what will the  difficult reader have more  in the materials for his romance  did we  gather about the grate after we had done dinner  and each tell the  story of his life  or at least the most remarkable thing that had ever  happened to him      illustration  the  stump  of st  botolph s church against the sky     i cannot say  but i remember that my friend and i  in my instant hunger  for boston  which was greater than my hunger for dinner  set forth while  the meal was preparing  and visited the church of st  botolph  to reach  it we had to pass through the greater length of the market place  one  of the most picturesque in england  and the worthy ancestress of  faneuil hall and quincy market places  which are the most picturesque in  america  at one side of its triangle is the birthplace and dwelling  of jean ingelow  and at the point nearest the church is the statue of  herbert ingram  the less famous but more locally recognized bostonian   who founded the  illustrated london news  with the money he made by the  invention and sale of old parr s pills  he was thrice sent to parliament  from his native town  and he related it to america  after two centuries   by drowning in lake michigan   r  n    the otherwise anonymous author of  a very intelligent and agreeable  handbook of boston   relates that in  his first canvass for parliament ingram was opposed by a gentleman who   when he asked the voices of the voters  after the old english fashion   was told by four of them in succession that they were promised  to their  cousin ingram   and who thereupon declared that if he had known ingram   was cousin to the whole town  he would  never have stood against him   like the bostonians of massachusetts  the bostonians of lincolnshire  were in fact closely knit together by ties of kinship  owing   r  n    believes  to the isolation of boston before the draining of its fens   and not to their conviction that there were no outsiders worthy to mate  with them       ii    the house where the martyrologist john fox first saw the light was  replaced long ago by a famous old inn  pulled down in its turn  but the  many and many americans who visit boston may still visit the house where  jean ingelow was born  whether they may see more than the outside of it  i do not know from experiment or even inquiry   r  n   will say nothing  of her but that she was born  and that her father was a banker  perhaps  he thinks that she has spoken sufficiently for herself      illustration  the worthy ancestress of faneuil hall and quincy  market places     the air of the market place  as we crossed to the church  was of a  pleasant bleakness  and the witham was coldly washing under the wall  which keeps st  botolph from it  in the dimness we could have only a  conjecture of the church s outward beauty  and of the grandeur of the  tower climbing into the evening  where it has hailed so many myriads  of moving ships  and beckoned them to safety  but within  where it was  already night  the church was cheerfully luminous with welsbach lights   which showed it all wreathed and garlanded for a harvest festival   began the day before  and to be concluded now with some fit religious  observance  the blossoms and leaves were a little wilted and withered   but the fruits and vegetables were there in sturdy endurance  and  together they swathed the pulpit from which john cotton used to preach   and all but hid its structure from view  like flowers of rhetoric  softening some hard doctrine     apparently  however  cotton s doctrine was not anywise too hard  or  even hard enough  for such  a factious people  who were imbued with the  puritan spirit   as he found in boston  when he was first elected vicar  of st  botolph s  and it was not till archbishop laud s ecclesiastical  tyrannies began that he came to see  the sin of conformity  and to  preach resistance  his conflict with the authorities went so far that  exile to another boston in another hemisphere became his only hope   or  as lord dorset intimated   if he had been guilty of drunkenness   uncleanness  or any lesser fault  he could have obtained his pardon   but as he was guilty of puritanism  and non conformity  the crime was  non pardonable  and therefore he advised him to flee for his safety      the cotton chapel  so called  was restored mainly with moneys received  from cotton s posterity  lineal or lateral  in his city of refuge  overseas  and  the corbels that support the timbered ceiling are carved  with the arms of certain of the early colonists of new england   edward  everett  one of cotton s descendants  wrote the dedicatory inscription  in latin  which  r  n   has englished in verse  and i am the more  scrupulous to quote it  because  as i must own with my usual reluctant  honesty  i quite missed seeing the cotton chapel          that here john cotton s memory may survive       where for so long he labored when alive        in james  reign and charles   ere it ceased         a grave  skilled  learned  earnest parish priest        till from the strife that tossed the church of god       he in a new world sought a new abode        to a new england  a new boston came         that took  to honor him  that reverend name        fed the first flock of christ that gathered there         till death deprived it of its shepherd s care         there well resolved all doubts of mind perplext        whether with cares of this world or the next        two centuries five lustra from the year       that saw the exile leave his labors here        his family  his townsmen  with delight          whom to the task their english kin invite          to the fair fane he served so well of yore        his name  in two worlds honored  thus restore        this chapel renovate  this tablet place        in this  the year of man s recovered grace                                       iii    i missed most of the other memorable things in the church that night   but i saw fleetingly some of the beautiful tombs for which it is famous   the effigies of the dead lay in their niches  quietly  as if already  tucked away for the night  in the secular sleep of the dust beneath  the  tombs were more famous than they  and more beautiful  if the faces of  some were true likenesses  but after so many centuries one ought not to  require even women to be pretty      illustration  the river at evening     we had not begun to have enough of boston yet  and after dinner we went  a long walk up the witham  away from the parapet before the church   under which its deep tides are always washing to and fro  in the  dimness  after we had got a little to the outskirts of the town  there  seemed shipyards along the river s course  but at one place there was  a large building brilliantly lighted  which from certain effects at the  windows we decided to be a printing office on the scale of those in and  near our own boston  what was our shame and grief the next morning  to find it was a cigar factory  and to learn that cigar and cigarette  making was almost the chief industry of the mother boston  there are  really two large tobacco factories there running overtime  and always  advertising for more women and girls to do their work  and in our  boston  not so long ago  smoking in the street was forbidden  such are  the ironies of life     what the shipyards had turned into by daylight  i do not now remember   the witham had turned into a long  deep gash  cut down into the clay  twenty feet from the level of the flood tides  we crossed on a penny  ferry which the current pushed over in the manner of the earliest  ferries  near the tobacco factory  and came back into the heart of the  town through streets of low stone houses  with few buildings of note to  dignify their course  small craft lay along the steep muddy shores  and  at one place a little excursion steamer was waiting for the tide to  come in and float it for the fulfilment of its promise of sailing at ten  o clock  we idly longed to make its voyage with it  and if the chance  were offering now  i certainly should not forego it as i did then  but  when you are in a foreign place  no matter how much you have travelled  and how well you know that it will not offer soon again  you reject the  most smiling chance because you think you can take it any time     the morning was soft and warm  with a sun shining amiably on the rather  commonplace old town  i had risen betimes that i might go and get  a spanish melon for my breakfast  but at eight o clock i found the  fruiterer s locked and barred against me  i lingered and hungered for  the melons which i saw in his window  and then i tried other fruiterers   but none of them was stirring yet  i reflected how different it would  have been in our own boston  and if it had not been for the market  people coming into the square and beginning to dress their stalls with  vegetables  and fish  and native fruits  such as hard pears and knotty  apples  i do not know how ill i might have come away thinking of that  idle mother boston  in other squares there were cattle for sale later   and fish  but i cannot in even my present leniency claim that the  markets were open at the hour which the genteeler commerce of the place  found so indiscreet  they were irregular spaces of a form in keeping  with the general shambling and shapeless character of the town  which   once for all  i must own was not an impressive place     the best thing in it  and the thing you are always coming back to   is the beautiful church  to which we paid a second visit early in the  forenoon  we found it where we left it the night before  lifting its  tower from the brink of the witham  and looking far out over the flat  land to a sea no flatter  the land seems indeed  like so much english  coast  merely the sea come ashore  and turned into fens for the greater  convenience of the fishermen  whom  with the deeper sea sailors  we  saw about the town  lounging through the crooked streets  and hanging  bare armed upon the parapets of the bridges  now we found the church  had about its foot a population of bostonians for whom  under their flat  gravestones  it had been chiming the quarters from its mellow throated  bells  while the bostonians on our side had been hustling for liberty   and money  and culture  and all the good things of this world  and  getting them in a measure that would astonish their namesakes  within  the church we saw again the beautiful tombs of the night before  and  others like them  and again we saw the pulpit of john cotton  which we  could make out a little better than at first  because its garlands were  a little more withered and shrunken away  but better than either we  realized the perfection of the church interior as a whole  so ample  so  simple  such a comfortable and just sufficient eyeful       iv    from other interests in st  botolph s you somehow keep always  or  finally  coming to the stump  as the tower is called somewhat in the  humor of our boston  it is not so fair within as without  that could  not be in the nature of things  and yet the interior of the tower has a  claim upon the spectator s wonder  if not his admiration  which  so far  as i know  the interior of no other tower has  it is all treated as a  loftier room of the church  and its ceiling  a hundred and fifty feet  from the ground  is elaborately and allegorically groined  the work was  done when the whole church was restored about half a century ago  and  has not the claim of medieval whim upon the fancy  not so much pleasure  as he might wish mingles with the marvel of the beholder  who carries a  crick in the neck away from the sight  and yet once  but not more  in a  way  it is worth while to have had the sight  certainly this treatment  of the tower is unique  there is nothing to compare with it in boston   massachusetts  and cannot be even when the interior of the old south is  groined     when we came out of the church  we found the weather amusing itself  as usual in england  raining with wind  then blowing without rain  and  presently  but by no means decisively  sunning without either wind or  rain  the conditions were favorable to a further exploration of the  town  which seemed to have a passion for old cannon  and for sticking  them about in all sorts of odd nooks and corners  we found one smaller  piece over a gateway  which we were forbidden by a sign board to enter  on pain of prosecution for trespassing  there was nothing else to  prevent our entering  and we went in  to find ourselves in an alley with  nothing but a gypsy van in it  nothing but a gypsy van  as if that were  not the potentiality of all manner of wild romance  whether the alley  belonged to gypsies  or the gypsies had trespassed by leaving their van  in it  i shall now probably never know  but i commend the inquiry to any  reader of mine whom these pages shall inspire to repeat our pilgrimage      illustration  lifting its tower from the brink of the witham     there was no great token of genteel life in boston  so far as we saw it   but perhaps we did not look in the right places  there were good shops   but not fine or large ones  and i am able to report of the intellectual  status that there are three weekly newspapers  but no dailies  which  could not be the case in any american town of fourteen thousand people   concerning society  i can only say that in our wanderings we came at one  point on a vast  high walled  iron gated garden  which looked as if it  might have society beyond it  but not being positively forbidden we did  not penetrate it  we did indeed visit the ancient grammar school  one  of those foundations which in england were meant originally for the poor  deserving of scholarship  but which have nearly all lapsed to the more  deserving rich  careful of the contamination of the lower classes   being out of term the school was closed to its pupils  but we found  a contractor there removing the old stoves and putting in a system of  hot water heating  which he said was better fitted to resist the cold  of the boston winters  he was not a very conversable man  but so much we  screwed out of him  with the added fact that the tuition of that school  was no longer free  it came to some five guineas a year  no great sum   but perhaps sufficient to keep the school  with the other influences   select enough for the patronage to which it had fallen  it was a  pleasant place  with a playground before it  which in the course of  generations there must have been a good deal of schoolboy fun got out  of       v    there remained for us now only the guildhall to visit  and we had left  that to the last because it was the thing that had mostly brought us  to boston  it was the scene of the trial and imprisonment of those poor  people of the region roundabout who were trying to escape from their   dread lord   james the first  and were arrested for this crime  and  brought to answer for it before the magistrates of the town  their dread  lord had then lately met some ministers of their faith at hampton court   and there browbeaten  if not beaten  them in argument  so that he was in  no humor to let  these people  who afterward became the pilgrim fathers   get away to holland  where there was no dread lord  or at least none of  king james  thinking     but no words can be so good to tell of all this as the words of governor  bradford in his  historie of plymouth plantation   where he says that   ther was a large companie of them purposed to get passage at boston in  lincolnshire  and for that end had hired a shipe wholy to them selves     made agreement with the maister to be ready at a certaine day  and take  them and their goods in  at a conveniente place  wher they accordingly  would all attende in readiness  so after long waiting    large expences   though he kepte not day with them  yet he came at length   tooke them  in  in the night  but when he had them   their goods abord  he betrayed  them  haveing before hand complotted with the serchers   other officers  so to doe  who tooke them  and put them into open boats    ther rifled  and ransaked them  searching them to their shirts for money  yea even  the women furder then became modestie  and then caried them back into  the towne    made them a spectakle   wonder to the multitude  which  came flocking on all sides to behould them  being thus first  by the  catchpoule officer  rifled    stripte of their money  books  and much  other goods  they were presented to the magistrates  and messengers  sente to informe the lords of the counsell of them  and so they were  comited to ward  indeed the magistrats used them courteously  and shewed  them what favour they could  but could not deliver them till order  came from the counsell table  but the issue was that after a months  imprisonmente  the greatest parte were dismiste    sent to the places  from whence they came  but    of the principall were still kept in  prison  and bound over to the assises      my excellent  r  n   of the  handbook of boston  is anxious to have his  reader  as i in turn am anxious to have mine  distinguish between these  future pilgrim fathers and the gentlemen and scholars who later founded  boston in massachusetts bay  and called its name after that of the town  they had dwelt in or often visited before they left the handsome keeping  of the gentler life of lincolnshire  such were richard bellingham   edmund quincy  thomas leverett  john cotton  samuel whiting  and  others  known to our colonial and national history  not even bradford  or brewster  afterward dignified figures in plymouth colony  were of the  humble band  men  women  and children  that the officers of boston took  from their vessel   pathetic but splendid figures   my brave  r  n    calls them  and he tells how  after a month s jail  they were  sent home  broken men  to endure the scoffs of their neighbors and the rigors of  ecclesiastical discipline        vi    the dungeons which remain to witness of their hardships in boston are of  thick walled  iron grated stone  and the captives were fed on bread  and water within smell of the roasting and broiling of the guildhall  kitchens immediately beside them  i will not conjecture with  r  n    that they were put there  by a refinement of cruelty   so that they  might suffer the more in that vicinage   the magistrates  who had  used  them courteously and shewed them what favour they could   would not have  willed that  but perhaps  the counsell table  did  and it was certainly  a hardship that the dungeons and the kitchens were so close together  as  any man may see at this day  neither the dungeons nor the kitchens are  any longer used  the spits and grates are rusted where the fires blazed   and the cells where the pilgrims suffered are now full of large earthen  jars  for no other or better reason  the large open spaces of the  basement outside of them were scattered about with agricultural  implements  ploughs  harrows  and the like  it was the belief of my  companion  founded on i know not what fact  that the hall in which the  pilgrims were tried was a large upper chamber which we found occupied by  a boys  school  the door stood partly ajar  and we could see the master  within walking up and down before some twenty boys  as if waiting for  one of them to answer some question he had put them  perhaps it was a  question of local history  for none of them seemed able to answer it   presently when a boy came out on some errand  and we stopped him  and  asked him where it was the pilgrims had been tried  he did not know   and apparently he had never heard of the pilgrims  he was a very  nice looking boy  and otherwise not unintelligent  certainly he was  well mannered  as nice looking english boys are apt to be with their  elders  perhaps he had heard too much of the pilgrims  and had purposely  forgotten them  this might very well have happened in a place like  boston where such hordes of americans are coming every year  and asking  so many hard questions concerning an incident of local history not  wholly creditable to the place  he could justly have said that the same  or worse might have happened to the pilgrims anywhere else in england   under the dread lord there then was  and in fact something of the same  hardship did befall them afterward at the place a little northeast of  boston  which we were now to visit for their piteous sake      the nexte spring after   as bradford continues the narrative of their  sorrows   ther was another attempte made by some of these   others  to  get over at an other place  and so it fell out  that they light of a  dutchman at hull  having a ship of his owne belonging to zealand  they  made agreements with him  and acquainted him with their condition   hoping to find more faithfullnes in him  then in the former of their  owne nation  he bad them not fear  for he would doe well enough  he  was by appointment to take them in betweene grimsbe   hull  where was  a large comone a good way distante from any towne  now against the  prefixed time  the women   children  with the goods  were sent to the  place in a small barke  which they had hired for that end  and the men  were to meete them by land  but it so fell out  that they were ther a  day before the shipe came  and the sea being rough  and the women very  sicke  prevailed with the seamen to put into a creeke hardby  wher they  lay on ground at lowwater  the nexte morning the shipe came  but they  were fast    could not stir till about noone  in the mean time  the  shipe maister  perceiveing how the matter was  sente his boate to be  getting the men abord whom he saw ready  walking aboute the shore  but  after the first boat full was gott abord    she was ready to goe for  more  the mr  espied a greate company  both horse   foote  with bills     gunes    other weapons  for the countrie was raised to take them  the  dutchman seeing this swore his countries oath   sacremente   and having  the wind faire  waiged his ancor  hoysed sayles    away  but the poore  men which were gott abord  were in great distress for their wives and  children  which they saw thus to be taken  and were left destitute of  their helps  and them selves also  not having a cloath to shifte them  with  more then they had on their baks    some scarce a peney aboute  them  all they had being abord the barke  it drew tears from their  eyes  and any thing they had they would have given to have been a shore  againe  but all in vaine  ther was no remedy  they must thus sadly part   the rest of the men there were in greatest danger  made shift to escape  away before the troope could surprise them  those only staying that best  might  to be assistante unto the women  but pitifull it was to see the  heavie case of these poore women in this distress  what weeping   crying  on every side  some for their husbands  that were carried away in the  ship as is before related  others not knowing what should become of  them    their little ones  others again melted in teares  seeing their  poore little ones hanging aboute them  crying for feare  and quaking  with could  being thus aprehanded  they hurried from one place to  another  and from one justice to another  till in the ende they knew not  what to doe with them  for to imprison so many women   innocent children  for no other cause  many of them  but that they must goo with their  husbands  seemed to be unreasonable and all would crie out of them   and to send them home againe was as difficult  for they aleged  as the  trueth was  they had no homes to goe to  for they had either sould  or  otherwise disposed of their houses   livings  to be shorte  after they  had been thus turmoyled a good while  and conveyed from one constable to  another  they were glad to be ridd of them in the end upon any termes   for all were wearied   tired with them  though in the mean time they   poore soules  indured miserie enough  and thus in the end necessitie  forste a way for them        vii    if there is any more touching incident in the history of man s  inhumanity to man  i do not know it  or cannot now recall it  and it was  to visit the scene of it near  grimsbe   or great grimsby  as it is now  called  that we set out  after viewing their prison in boston  over wide  plains  with flights of windmills alighted on them everywhere  here and  there one seemed to have had its wings clipped  and we were told by a  brighter young fellow than we often had for a travelling companion  that this was because steam had been put into it as a motive power more  constant than wind  even on that wind swept coast  there seems to have  been nothing else  so far as my note book witnesses  to take up our  thoughts in the short run to great grimsby  and for all i know now i  may have drowsed by many chicken yards marking the birthplace of our  discoverers and founders  we got to great grimsby in time for a very  lamentable lunch in a hostelry near the station  kept  i think  for such   poore people  as the pilgrims were  with stomachs not easily turned by  smeary marble table tops with a smeary maid having to take their orders   and her ineffective napkin in her hand  the honesty as well as the  poverty of the place was attested  when  returning to recover a  forgotten umbrella  we were met at the door by this good girl  who had  left her bar to fetch it in anticipation of all question     at great grimsby  it seemed  there was no vehicle but a very exceptional  kind of cab   looking like a herdic turned wrongside fore  and unable  to orient itself aright   available for the long drive to that  large  comone a good way distante from any towne   which we were to make  if  we wished to visit the scene of the pilgrims  sufferings in their second  attempt to escape from their dread lord  in this strange equipage   therefore  we set out  and nine long miles we drove through a country  which seemed to rise with increasing surprise at us and our turnout on  each inquiry we made for the way from chance passers  just beyond the  suburbs of the town we entered the region of a vast  evil smell which  we verified as that of the decaying fish spread upon the fields  for  a fertilizer after they had missed their market in that great fishing  centre  otherwise the landscape was much the ordinary english landscape  of the flatter parts  but wilder and rougher than in the south or west   and constantly growing more so as we drove on and on  our cabman kept  a good courage  as long as the highway showed signs of much travel   but when it began to falter away into a country road  he must have  lost faith in our sanity  though he kept an effect of the conventional  respect for his nominal betters which english cabmen never part with  except in a dispute about fares and distances  we stayed him as well  as we could with some grapes and pears  which we found we did not  want after our lunch  and which we handed him up through his little  trap door  but a plaintive quaver grew into his voice  and he let his  horse lag in the misgiving which it probably shared with him  nothing  of signal interest occurred in our progress except at one point  near  a methodist chapel  where we caught sight of a gayly painted blue van   lettered over with many texts and mottoes  which my friend explained  as one of the vans intinerantly used by extreme protestants of the anne  askew persuasion to prevent the spread of romanism in england     the signs of travel had not only ceased  but a little in front of us the  way was barred by a gate  and beyond this gate there was nothing but a  sort of savage pasture  with many red and brown cattle in it  gathered  questioningly about the barrier  or lifting their heads indifferently  from the grass  just before we reached the gate we passed a peasant s  cottage  where he was sociably getting in his winter s coal  and he and  his wife and children  and the carter  all leaned upon whatever supports  they found next them  and stared at the extraordinary apparition of two   i hope  personable strangers driving in a hansom of extreme type into a  cow pasture  but we were not going to give ourselves away to their too  probable ignorance by asking if that were the place where the pilgrims  who founded new england were first stopped from going to holland     my friend dismounted  and opened the gate  and we drove in among the  cattle  and after they had satisfied a peaceful curiosity concerning us   they went about their business of eating grass  and we strayed over  the  large comone   and tried to imagine its looks nearly three hundred years  before  they could not have been very different  the place could hardly  have been much wilder  and there was the  creeke hardby wher they lay    the hapless women and children  in their boat  at lowwater   while the  evening came on  no doubt  just as it was doing with us  the weather  clearing  and the sunset glassy and cold  off yonder  away across the  solitary moor  was the course of the humber  marked for us by the trail  of a steamer s smoke through the fringes of trees  and for them by the  sail of the dutchman  who  when he saw next day that  great company   both horse and foote  with bills and gunes  and other weapons   coming  to harry those poor people   swore his countries oath   sacremente    and having the wind faire  waiged his ancor  hoysed sails  and away    leaving those desolate women and their little ones lamenting       viii    on our way back we stopped at a little country church  so peaceful  so  very peaceful  in the evening light  where it stood  withdrawn from the  highway  norman and gothic without  and within all so sweet and bare  and clean  that we could not believe in the old ecclesiasticism  which persecuted the puritans into the exile whither they carried the  persecuting spirit with them  a pretty child  a little girl  opened the  churchyard gate and held it for us to pass  and her gentleness made me  the more question the history of those dreadful days in the past  when i  saw a young lady  in the modern dress which i had so often lost my heart  to at the church parade in hyde park  going up a leafy lane  toward the  vicarage  from having been for tennis and afternoon tea at some pleasant  home in the neighborhood  i denied the atrocious facts altogether  she  had such a very charming hat on     the suburbs of great grimsby  after you reach them through that zone of  bad smell  are rather attractive  and you get into long clean streets of  small stone houses  like those of plymouth or southampton  and presently  you reach the humber  which is full of the steamers and sail  both  fishing and deep sea  of the prosperous port  with great booms of  sawlogs from norway  half filling the channel  and with a fringe of tall  chimneys from the sawmills along the shores  great grimsby is not only  the centre of a vast distributing trade in coal and lumber  but of a  still vaster trade in fish  it cuts one s pride  if one has believed  that gloucester  massachusetts  is the greatest fishing port in the  world  to learn that grimsby  with a hundred more fishing sail  is only    one  of the principal fishing ports  of the united kingdom  what can  one do against those brutal british statistics  we think our towns grow  like weeds  but london seems to grow half such a weed as chicago in a  single night      illustration  fishing ships at great grimsby     after we were got well into the town  we found ourselves part of an  immense bicycle parade  with bicyclers of both sexes on their wheels  in  masks and costumes  pierrots  and clowns  and harlequins and columbines   in a competition for the prettiest and fanciest dress     when we came to start from the station on our run to london  we  reflected that there were a great many of these bicyclers  and that they  would probably crowd us in our third class compartment  so  as we had  bought an excellent supper in baskets  such as they send you on the  trains everywhere in england  and wished to eat it in quiet  we sought  out the guard who was lurking near for the purpose  and bribed him to  shut us into that compartment  and not let any one else in  there  we remained in darkness  with our curtains drawn  and when  near  train time  the bicyclers began to swarm about the carriages  we heard  them demanding admittance to our compartment from our faithful guard   if that is the right way to call him  he turned them away with soft  answers  answers so very soft that we could not make out what he said   but he seemed to be inviting them into other compartments  which he  doubtless pretended were better  the murmurs would die away  and then  rise again  and from time to time we knew that a baffled bicycler was  pulling at our door  or vainly bumping against it  we listened with our  hearts in our mouths  but no one got in  and the train started  and we  opened our baskets and began to eat and to drink  like two aristocrats  or plutocrats  what made our inhuman behavior worse was that we were  really nothing of the kind  but both professed friends of the common  people  the story might show that when it comes to a question of  selfishness men are all alike ready to profit by the unjust conditions   however  it must be remembered that those people were only bicyclers  if  we could have conceived of them as masses we should have known them for  brothers  and let them in  probably                                                         aberystwyth  a welsh watering place      it is only some six or seven hours by train from london to aberystwyth   but if you will look at the names on a map of the cambrian railways   when you begin the welsh part of your journey  you will seem to be in a  stranger and farther country than that of prester john  pwllheli  cerrig  y drudion  gwerful goch  festiniog  bryn eglwys  llanidloes  maertwro   carnedd fibast  clynog fwr  llan y mawddwy machynlleth  duffws  are a  few out of the hundred names in the hills or along the valleys  giving  the near neighborhood of england an effect of more than mid asian  remoteness  the eye starts at their look  but if the jaw aches at the  thought of pronouncing them  it is our own wilful orthographical usage  that is at fault  the words  whose sound the letters faithfully render   are music  and they largely record a christian civilization which was  centuries old when the saxons came to drive the britons into the western  mountains and to call them strangers in the immemorial home of their  race  the britons of the roman conquest  who became the welsh of the  baffled saxon invaders  and are the cymry of their own history and  poetry  still stand five feet four in their stockings  where they have  stood from the dawn of time  an inexpugnable host of dark little men   defying the saeseneg in their unintelligible  imperishable speech       i    of course  except in the loneliest and farthest places  they speak  english as well as welsh  and they misplace their aspirates  which they  lost under the normans as the saxons did  but this did not happen to  them by conquest as it did to the saxons  they were beguiled of their  h s when they were cheated with a welsh born prince instead of the welsh  prince they were promised in the succession of their ancient lines   they had been devout christians  after their manner  in the earliest  centuries  as the prefix llan  or saint  everywhere testifies  the  country abounded in saints  whose sons inherited their saintship  and  at the reformation they became calvinists as unqualifiedly as their  kindred  the bretons  remained catholics  they have characterized the  english and americans with their strong traits in a measure which can  be dimly traced in the spread of their ten or twenty national names  and  they have kept even with the most modern ideals quite to the verge of  co education in their colleges  it is a fact which no welshman will  deny that cromwell was of welsh blood  shakespeare was unquestionably of  welsh origin  henry vii  was that welsh twdwr  or tudor  as the saeseneg  misspell it   who set aside the plantagenet succession  and was the  grandsire of  the great elizabeth   not to boast of bloody mary or henry  viii  but if these are not enough  there is the present chancellor of  the exchequer  mr  lloyd george  who is now the chief figure of the  english cabinet     the bad name which their own half countryman  giraldus cambrensis  gave  the welsh in the twelfth century  clings to them yet in the superstition  of all norman minded and saxon minded men  so that the englishman i met  on the way from edinburgh was doubtless speaking racially rather than  personally when he said that the welsh were the prize liars of the  universe  i for my part heard no lies in wales except those i told  myself  but as i am of welsh stock  perhaps my experience is not wholly  refutive of that englishman s position  i can only urge further the  noted philological fact that the welsh language is so full of imagery  that it is almost impossible to express in it the brute veracities in  which the english speech is so apt  otherwise i should say that nowhere  have i been used with a more immediate and constant sincerity than in  wales  the people were polite and they were almost always amiable  but  in english  at least  they did not say the thing that was not  and their  politeness was without the servile forms from lower to higher which  rather weary one in england  they said  yes   and  no   but as gently as  if they had always added  sir   if i have it on my conscience to except  from my sweeping praise of sincerity the expressman at aberystwyth who  promised that our baggage should be at our lodgings in an hour  and did  not bring it in five  i must add that we arrived on the last day of a  great agricultural fair  when even the new york transfer company might  have given a promise of more than wonted elasticity       ii    in the station of aberystwyth there were about three or four thousand  welshmen of the national height  volubly waiting for the trains to bear  them away to their farms and villages  but they made way most amiably  for the dismounting travellers  who in our case were led through them by  the most energetic porter i ever knew  they did not stare down upon us  from the unseemly altitude of other national statures  and often during  our stay i saw like crowds of civil men in the street markets who were  no taller  and sometimes there were women who had not scaled the heights  reached by our american girls  they would probably have competed fairly  well with these in the courses of the colleges to which the welsh send  their daughters as well as their sons  but i will not pretend that the  good looks of either the men or women was of the american average   i cannot even say that these contemporary ancient britons had the  advantage of the toothless english peasantry in the prompt dentistry  which is our peculiar blessing  in great britain  though i must not say  ireland  for i have never been there  a few staggering incisors seem  a formidable equipment of the jaw in lower class middle life and even  tender youth  the difference is a tremendous advantage which  if it does  not make for the highest character in us  will doubtless stand us in  good stead in any close with the well toothed japanese  and when we are  beaten  our gold fillings will go far to pay our indemnity     after all those thousands at the station had departed  there were still  visitors enough left in aberystwyth to distend the hotels uncomfortably   and the next morning we set out in the pursuit  always interesting and  alluring  of lodgings  the town seemed to be pretty full of lodgings   but as it was the middle of august  and the very height of the season   they were full up in dismaying measure  we found the only one not kept  by a welsh woman in the ostensible keeping of an englishwoman  a veteran  cockney landlady  but behind her tottering throne reigned a welsh  girl  under whose iron rule we fell as if we had been unworthy saeseneg  instead of cymric fetched americans  we had rejected other lodgings  because  though their keepers had promised to provision us  it always  appeared that we must go out and do the marketing ourselves  i shall  lastingly regret that we did not submit to this condition  for it would  have been one of the best means of studying the local life  but we held  out for the london custom  and before the welsh power  which has  so often made itself felt behind english thrones  could intervene   compliance was promised  after that it remained for the welsh power to  make our stay difficult  and our going easy      illustration  the beach  aberystwyth     otherwise the place was delightful  it was in almost the centre of the  long curve of the victoria terrace  with windows that looked down upon  the pebbly beach  and over the blue sea to the bluer stretch of the  pembrokeshire hills on the south  and the carnarvonshire hills on the  north  holding the lovely waters in their shadowy embrace  there was  not much shipping  and what there was seemed of the pleasure sort that  parties go down to the sea to be sick in  the long parade was filled  at most hours with the english who make the place their resort  whose  bathing began early in the morning and whose flirting continued far  into the night  with forenoon and afternoon dawdling and dozing on the  pebbles  at one end of the terrace rose a prodigious headland  whose  slope was scaled over with broken slate  like some mammoth heaving from  the deep and showing an elephantine hide of bluish gray  at the other  end was the amusement pier  with the co educational college  which is  part of the university of wales  and with divers hotels  somewhat behind  and beyond were the ruins of one of those castles which the normans  planted with a mailed fist at every vantage in wales  as their sole  means of holding down the swarming  squirming  fighting little dark  people of the country  even then they could not do it  for the welsh   often overrun  were never conquered  as they will tell you themselves if  you ask them  but wales is now perhaps the most peaceful country in the  world  its prisons for the most part stand empty  it is said   and the  people  once so turbulent  are as little given to violence as to vice   in fact  i once heard a great welsh scholar declare that in the old  times it was not the true welsh who kept up the fighting  either on the  public or the private scale  but the scotch and irish who had found  a home among them  in any case  it is true that after the normans had  planted their castles in wales to hold the country  it was all they  could do to hold the castles  and not till their enemies had imagined  having the english king s son born in one of them did they bring the  welsh under the english crown at last  even then that uncertain people  broke from their allegiance now and again  or the scotch and irish among  them did       iii    all sorts of sights and sounds might be expected on our terrace  but  that which especially warmed the heart of exile in us  and pleased the  fancy of other sojourners was the appearance  one evening  of a stately  band of tall men in evening dress and top hats  with musical instruments  in their grasp  and heads lifted high above their welsh following  we  called the power behind the throne to the window in our question and she  gave a glad cry   oh  they re the neegurs  they re the white neegurs    and at sight of our compatriotic faces at the pane  these beautiful  giants took their stand before our house  and burst into the familiar  music of the log cabin  the stern wheel steamboat  and the cornfield  as  well as the ragtime melodies of later days  it was a rich moment  and  i know not which joyed in it more  the welsh power or the american  sufferance     but here  before i go farther afield  i must note a main difference  between the welsh power and the english slavey to whom she corresponded  in calling and condition  she was so far educated as to know the  pseudonym of the friend who came to see us  and to have read his  writings in the  welsh gazette   treating our proposed triumph in his  distinction with the fine scorn she used for all our airs  if she had  been an old fashioned yankee help she could not have been more snubbing   but when we had been taught to know our place she was more tolerant  and  finally took leave of us without rancor     the notion of the general welsh education which her intelligence gave us  was carried indefinitely farther by the grocer s boy to whom our friend  presented me one evening  after he had been struggling to make me  understand what an  englyn  was  i am able now to explain that it is a  polite stanza which the welsh send with a present of fruit or flowers   or for a greeting upon any worthy occasion  it is rhymed  sometimes  at both ends of the lines  and sometimes in the middle of them  and it  presents all the difficulties of euphony which the indomitable welsh  glory in overcoming  but when my friend took me in hand  my ignorance  was of so dense a surface that he could make no impression on it  and he  said at last   let us go into this grocery  there s a boy here who will   show  you what an englyn is   and after i was introduced the kind youth  did so with pleasure  while he sold candles to one customer  soap to  another  cheese to another  and herring to another  he first wrote the  englyn in welsh  and when i had sufficiently admired it in that tongue   for which no atavistic knowledge really served me   he said he would  put it into english  and he did so  it was then not rhymed at both ends  or in the middle  but it was rhymed quite enough  and if it had not the  harp like sweetness of the original  it was still such a musical stanza  that i shall always be sorry to have lost it  what i can never lose  the impression of is the wide spread literary lore of the common welsh  people which the incident suggested  i could not fancy even a boston  grocer s boy doing the like  and perhaps this was an uncommon boy in  wales itself  he told me a good deal  which i have mainly forgotten   about the state of polite learning in his country and in what honor the  living bards were held  it seems that in that rhyming and singing little  land  the poets are still known as of old by their bardic names  as  jones  or evans  or edwards they have no fame beyond other men  but up  and down all wales they are celebrated as this bard or that  and are  honored according to their poetic worth       iv    after the appearance of the white neegurs on the terrace  i could hardly  have expected any livelier appeal to my american pride  and yet it came   one day  when i learned that the line of carriages which i saw passing  our windows were the vehicles bearing to some public function the  members of the british chautauqua  how far the name and idea of  chautauqua have since spread there is no saying  but it was the last  of our national inventions which i should have expected to find in  aberystwyth  though welsh culture was reasonably in its line  and the  eisteddfod was not out of keeping with the summer conferences held  beside our lovely up state lake  the british chautauqua  as i saw it   was a group of people from all parts of the united kingdom joined in the  pursuit of improvement and enjoyment  and they were now here on one of  their summer outings  they had been invited to a gentleman s place not  far from aberystwyth to view as indubitable a remnant of the holy grail  as now exists  and it was my very good fortune through the kind offices  of that friend of ours to be invited with them     it was a blamelessly rainless afternoon  of a sort commoner on the  western welsh coast than on other shores of the  rainy isles   but  not too common even there  and we drove out of the town through the  prettiest country of hillside fields and valleys opening to the sea   on a road that was fairly dusty in the hot sun  there were cottages   grouped and detached  all the way  with gray stone walls and blue slate  roofs  and in places the children ran out from them with mercenary  offerings of flowers and song  or with frank pleas for charity direct  i  yielded with reluctance to the instruction of a manchester economist in  my carriage  and denied them  when i would so much rather have abetted  them in their wicked attempts on our pockets  i remember ruefully still  that they had voices as sweet and eyes as dark as the children who used  to chase our wheels in italy  and i have no doubt they deserved quite as  well of us as those did     i got back my spirits when we left our carriages  and i found myself  walking up a pleasant avenue of wilding trees  with a young chautauquan  from australia who looked as if he might be a young chautauquan from  alabama  tall  and lean  and brown  we fell into talk about the trees   and he said how they differed in their green from the sombre gray of his  native forests  and then he  from that vast far continent of his  spoke  of the little island where we were  as home  that has always a strange  effect for us self outcasts from the great british roof  and whether it  makes us smile  or makes us sigh  it never fails to startle us when we  hear it from colonial lips  the word holds in common kindness canada and  india and south africa and australia  and it has its pathos in the fact  that the old mother of these mighty children seems to leave solely to  them the tenderness that draws them to her in that notion of home       v    there were about fifty of those british chautauquans  and when they had  ranged themselves on the grass before the shrubbery of a pleasant lawn   backed by a wooded slope  the dignified lady of the house came out with  a casket in her hand  and put it on a table  and the exercises began   fitly  if the casket really held the sacred relic  they began with  prayer  then a welsh soloist followed with a hymn  but whether she  sang in welsh or english  i do not remember  i am only sure she sang  divinely  and then came the speeches  the first of the speeches was by  our friend  who was the local unitarian minister  and of a religious  body not inconsiderable in that calvinistic wales  he told us how the  holy grail had been deposited with the monks of strata florida  the  famous old abbey near aberystwyth  but i forgot who made them this  trust  unless it was king arthur s knights  and i am not sure whether  the fact is matter of legend or history  what i remember is that when  the abbey was suppressed by henry viii   certain of the escaping monks  came with the relic to the gentle house where we then were  and placed  it in the keeping of the family who have guarded it ever since      illustration  aberystwyth from craig glas rocks     after our friend  the lady of this house took up the tale  and told in  words singularly choice and simple the story of the sacred relic as the  family knew it  i had only once before heard a woman speak  no less a  woman than our great and dear julia ward howe  and it seemed to me  that she spoke better than any man  and i must say of the chautauquans   hostess  that day  that if ever the englishwomen come into their full  political rights  as they seem sure to do  the traditions of good  sense and good taste in english public speaking will not pass  but  will prosper on through their orators  there were touches of poetry   nationally welsh  in what she said  and touches of humor perhaps  personally welsh  it seems that the cup had been famed throughout the  countryside for the miraculous property by which whoever drank from it  was cured of his or her malady  and it had been passed freely round to  all sufferers ever since it came into her family s keeping  that they  might make doubly sure of the miracle  it was the custom of the sick  not only to empty the cup  but to nibble a little bit of the wood  and  swallow that  so that in whatever state the monks of strata florida had  confided it  the vessel was now in the state we saw  saying this the  lady opened the casket holding it  and showed us the crescent shaped rim  of a wooden bowl  about the bigness of a cocoanut shell  all the rest  had been consumed by the pious sufferers whom it had restored to health     i am sorry  after all  to own that this cup is said by some authorities  not to be the holy grail  but a vessel like it carved out of the true  cross  but even so subordinate a relic is priceless  and as it is no  longer possible to drink from it  we may hope that the fragment will  remain indefinitely to after time  when they had wondered at the sight  of it the chautauquans and their friend were made free of the charming  seventeenth century house  which would be old for this country  but  which in the taste of that time was rather modern  and looked like the  casino of some italian villa  it abounded  as such houses in england do   in the pictured faces of the past  and in the memorials which only the  centuries can leave behind them  but was too graceful to seem rich   a  home of ancient peace   it looked  in its mild gray stone amidst its  lawns and shrubberies  the larger hold of the gardens and pleasaunces  through which the chautauquans followed from it       vi    at aberystwyth  and elsewhere in wales  one of the things i noticed was  the difference of the people from the people over the english border in  their attitude toward their betters  they might stand only five feet in  their stockings  but they stood straight  and if they were respectful   they were first self respectful  in our run from shrewsbury  their  language first made itself generally heard at newport  and it increased  in the unutterable names of the stations westward  the farther we passed  into their beautiful country  but they had always english enough to be  civil  though never servile  the country is beautiful in the new  england measure  but it is of a softer and smaller beauty  it looks more  caressable  it is like vermont rather than new hampshire  and it is  more like new england than old england in the greater number of isolated  farm houses  from which the girls as well as the boys come to the  university colleges for learning undreamt of by english farm villagers     the air was fresh and sweet  and though it seemed to shower wherever  we stopped to let another train go by on a siding of our single track   there was a very passable sense of summer sun  the human type as we  began to observe it and as we saw it afterward throughout the land was  not only diminutive  but rather plain and mostly dark  in the men  as to  the women they were  as they are everywhere  charming  with now and then  a face of extraordinary loveliness  and nearly always the exquisite west  of england complexion  in their manners the people could not be more  amiable than the english  who are as amiable as possible  but they  seemed brighter and gayer  this remained their effect to the last in  aberystwyth  and when one left the terrace where the english visitors  superabounded  the welsh had the whole place to themselves  i would not  push my conjecture  but it seemed to me that there was an absence of  the cloying loyalty which makes sojourn in england afflictive to the  republican spirit  i remember but one shop dedicated to the king s  majesty  with the royal arms over the door  though there may have  been many others  i am always warning the reader not to take me too  literally     though i was about the streets by day and by dark  i saw no disorderly  behavior of any kind in the town away from the beach  i do not mean  there was any by the sea  unless some athletic courtship among the young  people of the watering place element was to be accounted so  there was  not much fashion there  except in a few pretty women who recalled the  church parade of hyde park in their flowery and feathery costumes   back in the town there was no fashion at all  but a general decency  and comfort of dress  the welsh costume survives almost solely in the  picture postal cards  though perhaps in the hilly fastnesses the women  still wear the steeple crowned hats which we associate with the notion  of witches  when they come to market in aberystwyth they wear  hard  shiny black straw hats like the men s  amongst the throng of  saturday night shoppers i saw none of the drunkenness that one sees so  often in scottish streets  and in english cities  and  i grieve to say   even in some new england towns  in the welsh quarter sunday was much  more the sabbath than it was on the terrace  where indeed it seemed a  day of pleasure rather than praise       vii    all the week i had the best intention of hearing the singing in some of  the welsh churches  but my goodwill could not carry the day against the  fear of a sermon which i should not understand  a chance sermon would  probably have touched upon the education act which was then stirring  all dissenting england and wales to passive resistance  and from  lincolnshire to carnarvonshire was causing the distraint of tables  and chairs  tools  hams  clocks  clothing  poultry  and crops for the  payment of such part of the dissenters  taxes as would go to the support  of the church schools  possibly it might also have referred to the walk  out of the welsh members of parliament  this was an incident which i  heard mentioned as of imperial importance  though what caused it or came  of it i do not know     instead of going to church  i strolled up and down the terrace and  observed the watering place life  the town was evidently full  or  at least all the lodging houses were  and as it is with the english  everywhere in their summer resorts  there were men enough to go round   so that no poor dear need pine for a mate on that pleasant beach   aberystwyth is therefore to be commended to our overflow of girls   though whether there are many eligible noblemen among those youth i have  not the statistics for saying  all the visitors may have been people  of rank  i only know that i was told they were mostly from the midland  cities  and they seemed to be having the good time which people of brief  outings alone have  the bathing began  as i have noted  very early in  the day with the men in the briefest possible tights  the women  for  compensation  wore long trousers with their bathing skirts  and  they enhanced the modesty of their effect by the universal use of  bathing machines  pushed well away from the curious shore  there was not  much variety in the visiting english type  but there was here and there  a sharp imperial accent  as in the two pale little  spindle legged  anglo indian boys  with their hindu ayah  very dark  with sleek dark  hair  and gleaming eyes in a head not much bigger than a black walnut     the crescent of the beach was a serried series of hotels and  lodging houses  from tip to tip  but back of these were streets  of homelike  smallish dwellings  that broke rank farther away  and  scattered about in suburban villas  with trees and flowers and grass  around them  beyond stretched  as well as it could stretch among its  hills  the charming country of fields  and woods  and orchards       viii    i suppose i did not quite do my duty by the ruins of the norman castle   and i feel that it is now too late to repair my neglect  the stronghold  was more than once attempted by the welsh in those wars which make their  history a catalogue of battles  but it held out norman till the normans  turned english  owen glendover took it in       when it was three  hundred years old  though not yet feeble with age  and in due time one  of cromwell s lieutenants destroyed it  some very picturesque fragments  remain to attest the grace and strength of the ancient hold  it is  near the university college and the amusement pier  so that the mere  sight seers can do all the ordinary objects of interest at aberystwyth  in half a day or half an hour  but we were none of these  we had fallen  in love with the place  and we would fain have stayed on after the  week was up for which we had taken our lodging  it appeared from a  house to house canvass  that there was no other lodging to be had in all  that long crescent of the terrace  or  if this is incredible  there was  none we would have  our successors were impending  and though i think  our english landlady might have invented something for us at the last  moment  the welsh power was inexorable  her ideal was lodgers who would  go out and buy their own provisions  and we had set our faces against  that  some one must yield  and the welsh power could not  it was not in  her nature  we were therefore in a manner expelled from aberystwyth  but  our banishment was not from all wales  and this was how we went next to  llandudno                                                         llandudno  another welsh watering place      froissart s saying  if it was froissart s  that the english amuse  themselves sadly antedates that notion of merry england which is now  generally rejected by serious observers  i should myself prefer the  agnostic position  and say that i did not know whether the english were  glad or not when they looked gay  what i seem to be certain of  but i  do not say that i am certain  is that they look gayer in their places  of amusement than we do  i do not mean theatres  or parliaments  or  music halls  or lecture rooms  by places of amusement  but what we  call summer resorts a little more largely than those resorts which the  english call watering places  of these i should like to take as a type  the charming summer resort on the coast of north wales which is called  llandudno in print  and in speech several different ways       i    the english simply and frankly  after their blunt nature  call the place  landudno  but the welsh call it  according to one superstition of their  double  l  and their french  u   thlandidno  according to another  we  cannot spell it in english at all  but it does not much matter  for  the last superstition is the ever delightful but ever doubtful george  borrow s  who says that the welsh  ll  is the same as the spanish  ll    but who is probably mistaken  most other authorities agreeing that if  you pronounce it  lhl  you will come as near it as any saeseneg need   it is a constantly besetting question in wales  where the prefix  llan   speckles the map all over  owing to that multitude of saints who peopled  the country in the times when a saint s sons were every one saints  and  none was of particularly holy  or even good life  because he was known  for a saint  like a continental noble  he inherited his title equally  with all his brothers     but through whatever orthoepic mazes you search it  llandudno has every  claim on your regard and admiration  like aberystwyth  its sea front is  a shallow crescent  but vaster  with a larger town expanding back of it   and with loftier and sublimer headlands  at either end  closing it in a  more symmetrical frame  but i should say that its sea was not so blue   or its sky either  and its air was not so soft or dry  morally it is  more constantly lively  with a greater and more insistent variety of  entertainments  for the american its appeal might well have begun with  the sight of his country s flag floating over a tennis ground at the  neighboring watering place and purer welsh town of rhyl  the approach to  his affections was confirmed by another american flag displayed before  one of the chief hotels in llandudno itself  i learned afterward of the  landlord that this was because there were several chicago families in  his house  and fifteen americans in all  but why the tennis ground of  rhyl flew our national banner  i do not know to this day  it was  indeed that gentle moment when our innocent people believed themselves  peculiarly dear to the english  and might naturally suppose  if from  chicago  or boston  or denver  that the english would wish to see as  often as possible the symbol of our successful revolt from the princes  and principles to which they have religiously adhered      illustration  llandudno  the city and harbor     both that home of the patriotic chicago families  and the other best  hotel were too full for us  and after a round of the second best we  decided for lodgings  hoping as usual that they would bring us nearer  the native life  the best we could get  facing the sea midway of the  crescent  were not exactly welsh in their keeping  the landladies were   in fact  two elderly church of england sisters from dublin  who had  named their house out of a novel they had read  they said they believed  the name was italian  and the reader shall judge if it were so from its  analogue of osier wood  the maids in the house  however  were very truly  and very wickedly welsh  two tough little ponies of girls  who tied  their hair up with shoe strings  and were forbidden  when about their  work  to talk welsh together  lest they should speak lezing of those  irish ladies  the rogues were half english  but the gentle creature  who served our table was wholly welsh  small  sweet voiced  dark eyed   intelligent  who suffered from the universal rheumatism of the british  isles  but kept steadily to her duty  and accepted her fate with  patience and even cheerfulness  she waited on several other tables  for  the house was full of lodgers  all rather less permanent than ourselves   who were there for a fortnight  we found our landladies hoping  when we  said we were going  to have had us with them through the winter       ii    our fellow lodgers were quiet people of divers degrees  except perhaps  the highest  unless the nobility bring boiled hams with them when they  visit the seaside  the boiled ham of the drawing room floor was frankly  set out on the hall table  where it seemed to last a week  or at least  till the lodgers went away  there was much coming and going  for it was  the height of the season  with the prices at flood tide  we paid six  guineas a week for three bedrooms and a sitting room  but our landladies  owned it was dear  an infirm and superannuated sideboard served for a  dressing table in one room  in others the heavier pieces of furniture  stood sometimes on four legs  sometimes on three  we had the advantage  of two cats on the back fence  and a dog in the back yard  but if the  controversy between them was carried on in welsh  it is no wonder we  never knew what it was about     our hostesses said the welsh were dirty housekeepers   at least  we   think so   but i am bound to say their own cooking was very good  and  not being welsh our hostesses consented to market for us  except in the  article of spanish melons  these i bought myself of increasing cost and  size  when i alleged  the second morning  that the melon then sold  me for sixpence had been sold me by another boy for fourpence the day  before  my actual cymric youth said   then he asked you too little    which seemed a  non sequitur  but was really an unexpected stroke of  logic     it was the utmost severity used with me by my co racials in llandudno   they were in the great majority of the permanent inhabitants  but they  were easily outnumbered among the pleasurers by the saeseneg  whose  language prevailed  so that a chance word of welsh now and then was all  that i heard in the streets  some faint stirrings of ambition to follow  the language as far as a phrase book would lead were not encouraged by  the kindly bookseller who took my money for it  and i did not go on  it  is a loss for me in literature which translation cannot supply  for  the english lovers of welsh poetry  after praising it to the skies   are never able to produce anything which is not direly mechanical and  vacuous  the native charm somehow escapes them  the grace beyond the  reach of art remains with the cymric poets who have resources for its  capture unknown to their english admirers  george borrow seems the worst  failure in this sort  and the worst offender in giving his reader the  hopes he never fulfils  so that his  wild wales  is a desert of blighted  literary promises  i believe that the merit of welsh poetry dwells  largely  perhaps overlargely  in its intricate technique  and in the  euphonic changes which leave the spoken word ready for singing almost  without the offices of the composer       iii    one of the great musical contests  the yearly national eisteddfod  was  taking place that year at the neighboring town of rhyl  but i did not go  to hear it  not being good for a week s music without intermission   at llandudno there was only the music of the pierrots and the niggers   which those simple hearted english have borrowed  the one from  france and the other from these states  their passion for our colored  minstrelsy is  in fact  something pathetic  they like pierrots well  enough  and pierrots  are  amusing  there is no doubt of it  but they  dote upon niggers  as they call them with a brutality unknown among us  except to the vulgarest white men and boys  and the negroes themselves  in moments of exasperation  negro minstrelsy is almost extinct in the  land of its birth  but in the land of its adoption it flourishes in the  vigor of undying youth  no watering place is genuine without it  bands  of niggers haunt the streets and suburbs of london  and apparently every  high day or holiday throughout the british islands requires the stamp of  their presence as a nostrum requires the name of the patentee blown in  the bottle  the decay of their gay science began among us with the fall  of slavery  and the passing of the old plantation life  but as these  never existed in great britain the english version of negro minstrelsy  is not affected by their disappearance  it is like the english tradition  of the red skins  which has all but vanished from our superstition  but  remains as powerful as ever in the constant fancy of those islanders     the english like their niggers very  very black  and as their niggers  are english they know how to gratify the national preference  such a  spread of scarlet lips over half the shining sable face is known nowhere  else in nature or art  and it must have been in despair of rivalling  their fellow minstrels that the small american troupe we saw at  aberystwyth went to the opposite extreme and frankly appeared as the  white neegurs  at llandudno the blackness of the niggers was absolute   so that it almost darkened the day as they passed our lodging  along the  crescent of the beach on their way to their open air theatre beyond it   they were followed by a joyous retinue of boys and girls  tradesmen s  apprentices  donkeys  bath chairs  and all the movable gladness of the  watering place  to the music of their banjos and the sound of their  singing  they were going to a fold of the foot hills called the happy  valley  bestowed on the public for such pleasures by the local nobleman  whose title is given to a principal street  and to other points and  places  i suppose out of the public pride and gratitude  it is a  charming amphitheatre overlooked by the lofty tops around  and there  on the green slope the niggers had set up their stage  and ranged the  spectators  chairs in the classification of first  second  and third so  dear to the british soul  there they cracked their jokes  and there they  sang their songs  the songs were newer than the jokes  but they were  both kinds delivered with a strong cockney accent  and without an  aspirate in its place  but it was all richly acceptable to the audience   who laughed and cheered and joined in the chorus when asked  here   as everywhere  the crowd delighted equally in songs of the sloppiest  sentimentality and of humor nighest indecency      illustration  llandudno from great orme s neck     on the afternoon of our visit the good lady next me could not contain  her peculiar pride in the entertainment  and confided that she knew the  leader of the troupe  who was an old friend of her husband s  it was  indeed a time and place that invited to expansion  nothing could have  been friendlier and livelier than the spectacle of the spectators spread  over the grassy slope  or sublimer than the rise of the hills around  or  more enchanting than the summer sea  with the large and little shipping  on it  and the passenger steamers going and coming from liverpool and  all the points in the region round  the two headlands which mark the  limits of the beautiful beach  great orme s head  and little orme s  head  are both of a nobleness tempered to kindliness by the soft and  manageable beauty of their forms  i never got quite so far as little  orme s head  for it was full two miles from our lodging  and a fortnight  was not long enough for the journey  but with great orme s head i was on  terms of very tolerable intimacy  a road of the excellence peculiar to  england passes round on the chin  so to speak  and though i never went  the length of it  i went far enough to know the majesty of the seaward  prospect  from the crown of the head there is a view of perhaps all the  mountains in wales  which from this point appears entirely composed of  mountains  blue  blue and enchantingly fair  on the townward side you  may descend into the happy valley  as we did  and find always a joyous  crowd listening to the niggers  if  after some doubt of your way  you  have the favor of a nice boy and an intelligent collie dog  whom the boy  is helping herd home the evening cows of a pleasant farm  you will  have a charming glimpse of the local civilization  and perhaps you will  notice that the cows do not pay much attention to the boy  but obey the  dog implicitly  it is their old world convention       iv    from another side we had ascended the mountain by the tram line which  climbs it to the top  and at every twist and turn lavishes some fresh  loveliness of landscape upon your vision  near by  we noticed many  depressions and sinkages in the ground  and a conversable man in  well oiled overalls who joined us at a power house  said it was from the  giving way of the timbers in the disused copper mines  were they very  old  we asked  and he said they had not been worked for forty years  but  this  when you come to think of the abandoned roman mines yet deeper  in the hill  was a thing of yesterday  the man in the oily overalls  had evidently not come to think of it  but he was otherwise a very  intelligent mechanic  and of a hospitable mind  like all the rest of our  chance acquaintance in great britain  i do not know that i like to think  of those roman mines myself  where it is said the sea now surges back  and forth  they must have been worked by british slaves  who may be  fancied climbing purblindly out when the legions left britain  and not  joining very loudly in the general lamentation at their withdrawal   but probably tempering the popular grief with the reflection that the  heathen saxons could not be much worse     the hill top was covered with the trippers who seem perpetually  holidaying on their island  and who were always kind to their children  when they had them  and to each other when they had not  they were  commonly in couples  very affectionate and inoffensively young  they  wandered about  and from time to time went and had tea at one of the  tea houses which are always at hand over there  except the view there  was not much to see  the ways were rough  now and then you came to a  pink cottage or a white one where the peasantry  again  sold tea  at one  place in our walk over the occiput of great orme s head into the happy  valley in its bosom  we fell a prey to a conspiracy of boys selling  mignonette  it appeared to be a mignonette trust  or syndicate   confining its commerce to that flower     i have no other statistics to offer concerning business on great orme s  head  or indeed in all llandudno  one of the chief industries seemed to  be coaching  for a score of delightful places are to be easily reached  by the stages always departing from the hotels on the parade  there was  no particularly noticeable traffic in leek  though i suppose that as i  did not see the national emblem in any welshman s hat  to be sure  it  was not st  david s day  it must have been boiling in every welshman s  pot  i am rather ashamed to be joining  even at this remove  in the poor  english joking which goes on about the welsh  quite as much as about the  scotch  the irish having become too grave a matter for joking  there  are little burlesque manuals making merry with the language and its  agglutinative prolixity  which i shall certainly not quote  and  there are postal cards representing welsh dames drinking tea in tall  witch hats  with one of them saying   i wass enjoying myself shocking   look you   there was  of course  nothing serious in this joking  the  welsh  who have all the small commerce in their hands  gladly sold the  manuals and postals  and i did not see one englishman laughing over  them     the saeseneg visitors rather amused themselves with the sea and the  resources of the beach and the bathing  as contrasted with the visitors  at aberystwyth  so distinctly in the earlier and later stages of  love making  i should say those at llandudno were domestic  fathers and  mothers who used the long phalanx of bathing machines appointed to their  different sexes  and their children who played in the sand  i thought  the children charming  and i contributed tuppence to aid in the repair  of the sand castle of two nice little boys which had fallen down  it now  seems strange that i should have been asked for a subscription  but in  england subscriptions spare nobody  though i wonder if two such nice  little boys would have come to me for money in america  besides the  entertainment of lying all afternoon on the beach  or sitting beside it  in canopied penny chairs  there was more active diversion for all ages  and sexes in the circus prevailing somewhere in the background   and advertising itself every afternoon by a procession of six young  elephants neatly carrying each in his trunk the tail of the elephant  before him  there were also the delightful shows of the amusement pier  where one could go and see pierrots to one s heart s content  if one can  ever get enough of pierrots  i never can      illustration  the great pier  llandudno     besides all these daytime things there were two very good theatres  at  one of which i saw mr  barrie s  little mary  given better than in new  york  that was easy   and at the other a comic opera  with a bit of  comedy or tragedy in a stage box  not announced in the bills  the  audience was otherwise decorous enough to be composed of welsh baptist  elders and their visiting friends  but in this box there were two young  men in evening dress  scuffling with a young woman in dinner decolletee   and what appeared to be diamonds in her ears  they were trying   after what seems the convention of english seaside flirtation  to get  something out of her hand  and allowing her successfully to resist them   and their playful contest went on through a whole act to the distraction  of the spectators  who did not seem greatly scandalized  it suggested  the misgiving that perhaps bad people came to llandudno for their summer  outing as well as good  but there was no interference by the police or  the management with this robust side show  were the actors in the scene   all or any of them  too high in rank to be lightly molested in their  lively event  or were they too low  perhaps they were merely tipsy   but all the same their interlude was a contribution to the evening s  entertainment which would not have been so placidly accepted in  say   atlantic city  or coney island  or even newport  where people are said  to be more accustomed to the caprices of society persons  and more  indulgent of their whims       v    a more improving  and on the whole more pleasing  phase of the  indigenous life  and also more like a phase of our own  showed itself  the day of our visit to conway  a little way from llandudno  there  on  our offering to see the ruins of the wonderful and beautiful old castle   we were met at the entrance with a demand for an exceptional shilling  gate money  because of the fair for the local wesleyan chapel which was  holding in the interior  what seemed at first a hardship turned out a  chance which we would not have missed on any account  there was a large  tent set up in the old castle court  and a table spread with home made  dainties of many sorts  and waited upon by gentle maids and matrons who  served one with tea or whatever else one liked  all for that generously  inclusive shilling  they were welsh  they told us  and they were  speaking their language to right and left of us  while they were so  courteous to us in english  it was quite like a church fair in some  american village  where  however  it could not have had the advantage  of a ruined norman castle for its scene  and where it would not have  provided a range for target practice with air guns  or grounds for  running and jumping     the place was filled with people young and old who were quietly amusing  themselves and were more taken up with the fair than with the castle   i must myself comparatively slight the castle in the present study of  people rather than places  though i may note that if there is any  more interesting ruin in the world  i am satisfied with this which it  surpasses  besides its beauty  what strikes one most is its perfect  adaptation to the original purpose of palace and fortress for which the  normans planned their strongholds in wales  the architect built not only  with a constant instinct of beauty  but with unsurpassable science and  skill  the skill and the science have gone the way of the need of them   but the beauty remains indelible and as eternal as the hunger for it  in the human soul  conway castle is not all a ruin  even as a fortress   however  great part of it still challenges decay  and is so entire in  its outward shape that it has inspired the railway running under its  shoulder to attempt a conformity of style in the bridge approaching it   but without enabling it to an equal effect of grandeur  one would as  soon the bridge had not tried     all conway is worthy  within its ancient walls  of as much devotion as  one can render it in the rain  which begins as soon as you leave the  castle  the walls climb from the waters to the hills  and the streets  wander up and down and seem to the stranger mainly to seek that  beautiful old tudor house  plas mawr  which like the castle is without  rival in its kind  it was full of reeking and streaming sight seers   among whom one could easily find one s self incommoded without feeling  one s self a part of the incommodation  but in spite of them there was  the assurance of comfort as well as splendor in the noble old mansion   such as the elizabethan houses so successfully studied  in the  dining room a corner of the mantel has its sandstone deeply worn  away  and a much elbowed architect  who was taking measurements of the  chimney  agreed that this carf was the effect of the host or the butler  flying to the place and sharpening his knife for whatever haunch of  venison or round of beef was toward  it was a fine memento of the  domestic past  and there was a secret chamber where the refugees of this  cause or that in other times were lodged in great discomfort  besides   there was a ghost which was fairly crowded out of its accustomed  quarters  where so far from being able to walk  it would have had much  ado to stand upright by flattening itself against the wall       vi    in fact  there was not much more room that day in the plas mawr  than in  the smallest house in the world  which is the next chiefest attraction  of conway  this  too  was crammed with damp enthusiasts  passionately  eager to sign their names in the guest book  they scarcely left space in  the sitting room of ten by twelve feet for the merry old hostess selling  photographs and ironically inviting her visitors  guests to a glimpse  of the chamber overhead  or so much of it as the bed allowed to be seen   she seemed not to believe in her abode as a practicable tenement  and  could not be got to say that she actually lived in it  as to why it was  built so small she was equally vague  but there it was  to like or to  leave  and there  not far off  was the  briny beach  where the walrus  and the carpenter walked together             and wept like anything to see        such quantities of sand      for it was in conway  as history or tradition is  that  through the  looking glass  was written     there are very few places in those storied british isles which are  not hallowed by some association with literature  but i suppose that  llandudno is as exempt as any can be  and i will not try to invoke any  dear and honored shade from its doubtful obscurity  we once varied the  even tenor of our days there by driving to penmaenmawr  and wreaking our  love of literary associations so far as we might by connecting the place  with the memory of gladstone  who was literary as well as political  we  thought with him that penmaenmawr was  the most charming watering place  in wales   and as you drive into the place  the eye of faith will  detect the house  on the right  in which he spent many happy summers  we  contented ourselves with driving direct to the principal hotel  where  i know not what kept us from placing ourselves for life  we had tea and  jam en the pretty lawn  and the society of a large company of wasps of  the yellow jacket variety  which must have been true welsh wasps  as  peaceful as they were musical  and no interloping scotch or irish  for  they did not offer to attack us  but confined themselves altogether to  our jam  to be sure  we thought best to leave it to them      illustration  conway castle     it is said that the purple year is not purpler at any point on the  southernmost shores of england than it is at llandudno  in proof of the  mildness of its winter climate  the presence of many sorts of tender  evergreens is alleged  and the persistence of flowers in blooming from  christmas to easter  but those who have known the deceitful habits of  flowers on the riviera  where they bloom in any but an arctic degree of  cold  will not perhaps hurry to llandudno much later than november   all the way to penmaenmawr the flowers showed us what they could do in  summer  whether in field or garden  and there was one beautiful hill  on which immense sweeps and slopes of yellow gorse and purple heather  boldly stretched separately  or mingled their dyes in the fearlessness  of nature when she spurns the canons of art  i suppose there is no  upholsterer or paperhanger who would advise mixing or matching yellow  and purple in the decoration of a room  but here the outdoor effect rapt  the eye in a transport of delight  it was indeed a day when almost any  arrangement of colors would have pleased       vii    it is not easy in that much summer resorted region to get at the country  in other than its wilder moods  it is either town or mountain  but now  and then one found one s self among harvest fields  where the yield of  wheat and oats was far heavier than with us  either because the soil was  richer or the tilth thorougher  the farms indeed looked very fertile   and the farmhouses very alluringly clean and neat  at least on the  outside  they were not gray  as in the west of england  or brick as  in the southeast  but were of stone whitewashed  and the roofs were of  slate  and not thatch or tile  as i have noted  they were not so much  gathered into villages as in england  and again  as i have noted  it  is out of such houses that the farmers  boys and girls go to the  co educational colleges of the welsh university  it is still the  preference of the farmers that their sons should be educated for the  ministry  which in that country of multiplied dissents has pulpits for  every color of contrary mindedness  as well as livings of the not yet  disestablished english church  it is not indeed the english church in  speech  the welsh will have their service and their sermon in their own  tongue  and when an oxford or cambridge man is given a welsh living  he  must do what he can to conform to the popular demand  it is said that  in one case  where the incumbent long held out against the parish   he compromised by reading the service in welsh with the english  pronunciation  but the welsh churches are now supplied with  welsh speaking clergy  though whether it is well for the welsh to cling  so strongly to their ancient speech is doubted by many welshmen  these  hold that it cramps and dwarfs the national genius  but in the mean time  in ireland the national genius  long enlarged to our universal english   offers the strange spectacle of an endeavor to climb back into its  gaelic shell      illustration  plas mawr     i do not know whether an incident of my experience in coming from  chester to llandudno is to be offered as an illustration of welsh  manners or of english manners  a woman of the middle rank  certainly  below gentlewoman  but very personable and well dressed  got into our  carriage where there was no seat for her  she was no longer young  but  she was not so old as the american who offered her his seat  she refused  it  but consented to sit on the hand bag and rug which he arranged for  her  and so remained till she left the train  while a half grown boy  and several young men kept their countenances and their places  not  apparently dreaming of offering her a seat  or if they thought of her  at all  thought she was well punished for letting the guard crowd her  in upon us  by her stature and complexion she was undoubtedly welsh  and  these youth from theirs were as undoubtedly english  perhaps  then  the  incident had better be offered as an illustration of welsh and english  manners combined                                                         glimpses of english character      nothing is so individual in any man as the peculiar blend of  characteristics which he has inherited from his racial ancestries  the  englishman  who leaves the stamp of the most distinct personality upon  others  is the most mixed  the most various  the most relative of all  men  he is not english except as he is welsh  dutch  and norman  with   a little latin and less greek  from his earliest visitors and invaders   this conception of him will indefinitely simplify the study of his  nature if it is made in the spirit of the frank superficiality which i  propose to myself  after the most careful scrutiny which i shall be  able to give him  he will remain  for every future american  the  contradiction  the anomaly  the mystery which i expect to leave him       i    no error of the englishman s latest invader is commoner than the notion   which perhaps soonest suggests itself  that he is a sort of american   tardily arriving at our kind of consciousness  with the disadvantages  of an alien environment  after apparently hopeless arrest in unfriendly  conditions  the reverse may much more easily be true  we may be a sort  of englishmen  and the englishman  if he comes to us and abides with  us  may become a sort of american  but that is the affair of a possible  future  and the actual englishman is certainly not yet any sort of  american  unless  indeed  for good and for bad  he is a better sort  of bostonian  he does not even speak the american language  whatever  outlandish accent he uses in speaking his own  it may be said  rather  too largely  too loosely  that the more cultivated he is  the more he  will speak like a cultivated american  until you come to the king   or the royal family  with whom a strong german accent is reported to  prevail  the englishman may write american  if he is a very good  writer  but in no case does he spell american  he prefers  as far as  he remembers it  the norman spelling  and  the conqueror having said    geole    the conquered print  gaol   which the american invader must  pronounce  jail   not  gayol      the mere mention of the royal family advances us to the most marked of  all the superficial english characteristics  or  perhaps  loyalty is  not superficial  but is truly of the blood and bone  and not reasoned  principle  but a passion induced by the general volition  whatever  it is  it is one of the most explicitly as well as the most tacitly  pervasive of the english idiosyncrasies  a few years ago  say  fifteen  or twenty  it was scarcely known in its present form  it was not known  at all with many in the time of the latest and worst of the georges  or  the time of the happy go lucky sailor william  in the earlier time of  victoria  it was a chivalrous devotion among the classes  and with the  masses an affection which almost no other sovereign has inspired  i  should not be going farther than some englishmen if i said that her  personal character saved the monarchy  when she died there was not a  vestige of the republican dream which had remained from a sentiment  for  the free peoples of antiquity  rather than from the commonwealth   democracy had indeed effected itself in a wide spread socialism  but the  kingship was safe in the hearts of the queen s subjects when the prince  of wales  who was the first of them  went about praising loyalty as  prime among the civic virtues and duties  the notion took the general  fancy  and met with an acceptance in which the old superstition of kings  by divine right was resuscitated with the vulgar  one of the vulgar  lately said to an american woman who owned that we did not yield an  equal personal fealty to all our presidents   oh yes  but you know that  it is only your  people  that choose the president  but  god  gave us  the king   nothing could be opposed to a belief so simple  as in the  churches of the eldest faith the humble worshipper could not well be  told that the picture or the statue of his adoration was not itself  sacred  in fact  it is not going too far  at least for a very  adventurous spirit  to say that loyalty with the english is a sort of  religious principle  what is with us more or less a joke  sometimes  bad  sometimes good  namely  our allegiance to the powers that be in the  person of the chief magistrate  is with them a most serious thing  at  which no man may smile without loss     i was so far from wishing myself to smile at it  that i darkled most  respectfully about it  without the courage to inquire directly into the  mystery  if it was often on my tongue to ask   what is loyalty  how  did you come by it  why are you loyal    i felt that it would be  embarrassing when it would not be offensive  and i should vainly plead  in excuse that this property of theirs mystified me the more because it  seemed absolutely left out of the american nature  i perceived that in  the english it was not less really present because it was mixed  or used  to be mixed  with scandal that the alien can do no more than hint at   that sort of abuse has long ceased  and if one were now to censure the  king  or any of the royal family  it would be felt to be rather ill  bred  and quite unfair  since royalty is in no position to reply to  criticism  even the socialists would think it ill mannered  though  in their hearts  if not in their sleeves  they must all the while be  smiling at the notion of anything sacred in the sovereign      illustration  a presentation at court       ii    loyalty  like so many other things in england  is a convention to which  the alien will tacitly conform in the measure of his good taste or his  good sense  it is not his affair  and in the mean time it is a most  curious and interesting spectacle  but it is not more remarkable   perhaps  than the perfect acquiescence in the aristocratic forms of  society which hedge the king with their divinity  we think that family  counts for much with ourselves  in new england or in virginia  but it  counts for nothing at all in comparison with the face value at which it  is current in england  we think we are subject to our plutocracy  when  we are very much out of humor or out of heart  in some such measure as  the commoners of england are subject to the aristocracy  but that is  nonsense  a very rich man with us is all the more ridiculous for his  more millions  he becomes a byword if not a hissing  he is the meat of  the paragrapher  the awful example of the preacher  his money is found  to smell of his methods  but in england  the greater a nobleman is   the greater his honor  the american mother who imagines marrying her  daughter to an english duke  cannot even imagine an english  duke  say  like him of devonshire  or him of northumberland  or him  of norfolk  with the social power and state which wait upon him in his  duchy and in the whole realm  and so is it in degree down to the latest  and lowest of the baronets  and of those yet humbler men who have been  knighted for their merits and services in medicine  in literature  in  art  the greater and greatest nobles are established in a fear which is  very like what the fear of god used to be when the common people feared  him  and  though they are potent political magnates  they mainly rule  as the king himself does  through the secular reverence of those beneath  them for their titles and the visible images of their state  they are  wealthy men  of course  with so much substance that  when one now and  then attempts to waste it  he can hardly do so  but their wealth alone  would not establish them in the popular regard  his wealth does no  such effect for mr  astor in england  and mere money  though it is much  desired by all  is no more venerated in the person of its possessor than  it is with us  it is ancestry  it is the uncontested primacy of families  first in their place  time out of mind  that lays its resistless hold  upon the fancy and bows the spirit before it  by means of this comes  the sovereign effect in the political as well as the social state  for   though the people vote into or out of power those who vote other people  into or out of the administration  it is always  or so nearly always  that the exception proves the rule  family that rules  from the king  down to the least attache of the most unimportant embassy  no doubt many  of the english are restive under the fact  and  if one had asked their  mind about it  one might have found them frank enough  but  never asking  it  it was with amusement that i heard said once  as if such a thing had  never occurred to anybody before   yes  isn t it strange that those few  families should keep it all among themselves   it was a slender female  voice  lifted by a young girl with an air of pensive surprise  as at a  curious usage of some realm of faery       iii    england is in fact  to the american  always a realm of faery  in its  political and social constitution  it must be owned  concerning the  government by family  that it certainly seems to work well  that  justifies it  so far as the exclusion of the immense majority from the  administration of their own affairs can be justified by anything   though i hold that the worst form of graft in office is hardly less  justifiable  that is  at least  one of the people picking their pockets   but it is the universal make believe behind all the practical virtue of  the state that constitutes the english monarchy a realm of faery  the  whole population  both the great and the small  by a common effort of  the will  agree that there is a man or a woman of a certain line who  can rightfully inherit the primacy amongst them  and can be dedicated  through this right to live the life of a god  to be so worshipped and  flattered  so cockered about with every form of moral and material  flummery  that he or she may well be more than human not to be made a  fool of  then  by a like prodigious stroke of volition  the inhabitants  of the enchanted island universally agree that there is a class of them  which can be called out of their names in some sort of title  bestowed  by some ancestral or actual prince  and can forthwith be something  different from the rest  who shall thenceforth do them reverence  them  and their heirs and assigns  forever  by this amusing process  the realm  of faery is constituted  a thing which could not have any existence in  nature  yet by its existence in fancy becomes the most absolute of human  facts     it is not surprising that  in the conditions which ensue  snobbishness  should abound  the surprising thing would be if it did not abound  even  with ourselves  who by a seven years  struggle burst the faery dream a  century ago  that least erected spirit rears its loathly head from the  dust at times  and in our polite press we can read much if we otherwise  see nothing of its subtle influence  but no evil is without its  compensating good  and the good of english snobbishness is that it  has reduced loyalty  whether to the prince or to the patrician  from a  political to a social significance  that is  it does so with the upper  classes  with the lower  loyalty finds expression in an unparalleled  patriotism  an englishman of the humble or the humbler life may know  very well that he is not much in himself  but he believes that england  stands for him  and that royalty and nobility stand for england  both  of these  there  are surrounded by an atmosphere of reverence wholly  inconceivable to the natives of a country where there are only  millionaires to revere       iv    the most curious thing is that the persons in the faery dream seem to  believe it as devoutly as the simplest and humblest of the dreamers  the  persons in the dream apparently take themselves as seriously as if there  were or could be in reality kings and lords  they could not  of course   do so if they were recently dreamed  as they were  say  in the france  of the third empire  there  one fancies  these figments must have always  been smiling in each other s faces when they were by themselves  but  the faery dream holds solidly in england because it is such a very old  dream  besides  the dream does not interfere with the realities  it even  honors them  if a man does any great thing in england  the chief figure  of the faery dream recognizes his deed  stoops to him  lifts him up  among the other figures  and makes him part of the dream forever  after  that he has standing  such as no man may have with us for more than that  psychological moment  when all the papers cry him up  and then everybody  tries to forget him  but  better than this  the dream has the effect  if  it has not the fact  of securing every man in his place  so long as  he keeps to it  nowhere else in the world is there so much personal  independence  without aggression  as in england  there is apparently  nothing of it in germany  in italy  every one is so courteous and kind  that there is no question of it  in the french republic and in our own   it exists in an excess that is molestive and invasive  in england alone  does it strike the observer as being of exactly the just measure     very likely the observer is mistaken  and in the present case he will  not insist  after all  even the surface indications in such matters are  slight and few  but what i noted was that  though the simple and humble  have to go to the wall  and for the most part go to it unkicking  in  england they were  on their level  respectfully and patiently entreated   at a railroad junction one evening  when there was a great hurrying up  stairs and down  and a mad seeking of wrong trains by right people  the  company s servants who were taking tickets  and directing passengers  this way and that  were patiently kind with futile old men and women   who came up  in the midst of their torment  and pestered them with  questions as to the time when trains that had not arrived would leave  after they did arrive  i shuddered to think what would have at least  verbally happened to such inquirers with us  but  there  not only their  lives but their feelings were safe  and they could go away with such  self respect as they had quite intact       v    in no country less good hearted than england could anything so  wrong headed as the english baggage system be suffered  but  there   passengers of all kinds help the porters to sort their trunks from other  people s trunks  on arrival at their stations  and apparently think it  no hardship  the porters  who do not seem especially inspired persons   have a sort of guiding instinct in the matter  and wonderfully seldom  fail to get the things together for the cab  or to get them off the cab   and  duly labelled  into the luggage van  once  at a great junction   my porter seemed to have missed my train  and after vain but not  unconsidered appeals to the guard  i had to start without it  at  the next station  the company telegraphed back at its own cost the  voluminous message of my anxiety and indignation  and i was assured that  the next train would bring my valise from crewe to edinburgh  when i  arrived at edinburgh  i casually mentioned my trouble to a guard whom i  had not seen before  he asked how the bags were marked  and then he said  they had come with us  my porter had run with them to my train  but in  despair of getting to my car with his burden  had put them into the  last luggage van  and all i had to do was now to identify them at my  journey s end     why one does not  guiltily or guiltlessly  claim other people s baggage   i do not know  but apparently it is not the custom  perhaps in this  the  deference for any one within his rights  peculiar to the faery dream   operates the security of the respective owners of baggage that could  otherwise easily be the general prey  while i saw constant regard paid  for personal rights  i saw only one case in which they were offensively  asserted  this was in starting from york for london  when we attempted  to take possession of a compartment we had paid for from the nearest  junction  in order to make certain of it  we found it in the keeping  of a gentleman who had turned it from a non smoking into a smoking  compartment  and bestrewn it with his cigar ashes  when told by the  porters that we had engaged the compartment  he refused to stir  and  said that he had paid for his seat  and he should not leave it till he  was provided with another  in vain they besought him to consider our  hard case  in being kept out of our own  and promised him another place  as good as the one he held  he said that he would not believe it till he  saw it  and as he would not go to see it  and it could not be brought to  him  there appeared little chance of our getting rid of him  i thought  it best to let him and the porters fight it out among themselves  when  a force of guards appeared  they were equally ineffective against  the intruder  who could not  or did not  say that he did not know the  compartment was engaged  suddenly  for no reason  except that he had  sufficiently stood  or sat  upon his rights  he rose  and the others  precipitated themselves upon his hand baggage  mainly composed of  fishing tackle  such as a gentleman carries who has been asked to  somebody s fishing  and bore it away to another part of the train  they  left one piece behind  and the porter who came back for it was radiantly  smiling  as if the struggle had been an agreeable exercise  and he spoke  of his antagonist without the least exasperation  evidently  he regarded  him as one who had justly defended himself from corporate aggression   his sympathies were with him rather than with us  perhaps because we had  not so vigorously asserted ourselves       vi    a case in which a personal wrong rather than a personal right was  offensively asserted  was that of a lady  young and too fair to be so  unfair  in a crowded train coming from the doncaster races to york  she  had kept a whole first class compartment to herself  putting her maid  into the second class adjoining  and heaping the vacant seats with her  hand baggage  which had also overflowed into the corridor  at the time  the train started she was comforting herself in her luxurious solitude  with a cup of tea  and she stood up  as if to keep other people out   but  after waiting  seven of us  in the corridor  until she should offer  to admit us  we all swarmed in upon her  and made ourselves indignantly  at home  when it came to that she offered no protest  but gathered up  her belongings  and barricaded herself with them  among the rest there  was a typewriting machine  but what manner of young lady she was  or  whether of the journalistic or the theatrical tribe  has never revealed  itself to this day  we could not believe that she was very high born   not nearly so high  for instance  as the old lady who helped dispossess  her  and who  when we ventured the hope that it would not rain on the  morrow  which was to be st  leger day  almost lost the kindness for us  inspired by some small service  because we had the bad taste to suggest  such a possibility for so sacred a day     i never saw people standing in a train  except that once which i have  already noted  when in a very crowded car in wales  two women  decent  elderly persons  got in and were suffered to remain on foot by the young  men who had comfortable places  no one dreamed  apparently  of offering  to give up his seat  but  on the other hand  a superior civilization  is shown in what i may call the manual forbearance of the trolley and  railway folk  who are so apt to nudge and punch you at home here  when  they wish your attention  the like happened to me only once in england   and that was at liverpool  where the tram conductor  who laid hands  on me instead of speaking  had perhaps been corrupted by the unseen  american influences of a port at which we arrive so abundantly and  indiscriminately  i did not resent the touch  though it is what every  one is expected to do  if aggrieved  and every one else does it in  england  within his rights  every one is safe  though there may be some  who have no rights  if there were  i did not see them  and i suppose  that  as an alien  i might have refused to stand up and uncover when the  band began playing  god save the king   as it did at the end of every  musical occasion  i might have urged that  being no subject of the king   i did not feel bound to join in the general prayer  but that would have  been churlish  and  where every one had been so civil to me  i did not  see why i should not be civil to the king  in a small matter  in the  aggregate indeed  it is not a small matter  and i suppose that the  stranger always finds the patriotism of a country molestive  patriotism  is  at any rate  very disagreeable  with the sole exception of our own   which we are constantly wishing to share with other people  especially  with english people  we spare them none of it  even in their own  country  and yet many of us object to theirs  i feel that i am myself  being rather offensive about it  now  at this distance from them  upon  the whole  not caring very actively for us  one way or the other  they  take it amiably  they try to get our point of view  and  as if it were a  thorn  self sacrificially press their bosoms against it  in the present  or recent  entente cordiale   none of their idiosyncrasies is more  notable than their patience  their kindness with our divergence from  them  but i am not sure that  having borne with us when we are by  they  do not take it out of us when we are away     we are the poetry of a few  who  we like to think  have studied the  most deeply into the causes of our being  or its excuses  but you cannot  always be enjoying poetry  and i could well imagine that our lovers must  sometimes prefer to shut the page  the common gentleness comes from the  common indifference  and from something else that i will not directly  touch upon  what is certain is that  with all manner of strangers   the english seem very gentle  when they meet in chance encounter  the  average level of good manners is high  my experience was not the widest   and i am always owning it was not deep  but  such as it was  it brought  me to the distasteful conviction that in england i did not see the  mannerless uncouthness which i often see in america  not so often from  high to low  or from old to young  but the reverse  there may be much  more than we infer  at the moment  from the modulated voices  which  sweetens casual intercourse  but there are certain terms of respect   almost unknown to us  which more obviously do that effect  it is a pity  that democracy  being the fine thing it essentially is  should behave  so rudely  must we come to family government  in order to be filial or  fraternal in our bearing with one another  why should we be so blunt  so  sharp  so ironical  so brutal in our kindness       vii    the single mindedness of the english is beautiful  it may not help to  the instant understanding of our jokes  but then  even we are not always  joking  and it does help to put us at rest and to make us feel safe  the  englishman may not always tell the truth  but he makes us feel that we  are not so sincere as he  perhaps there are many sorts of sincerity  but  there is something almost caressing in the kindly pause that precedes  his perception of your meaning  and this is very pleasing after the  sense of always having your hearer instantly onto you  when  by a chance  indefinitely rarer than it is with us at home  one meets an irishman in  england  or better still an irishwoman  there is an instant lift of the  spirit  and  when one passes the scotch border  there is so much lift  that  on returning  one sinks back into the embrace of the english  temperament  with a sigh for the comfort of its soft unhurried  expectation that there is really something in what you say which  will  be clear by and by     having said so much as this in compliance with the frequent american  pretence that the english are without humor  i wish to hedge in the  interest of truth  they certainly are not so constantly joking as we  it  does not apparently seem to them that fate can be propitiated by a habit  of pleasantry  or that this is so merry a world that one need go about  grinning in it  perhaps the conditions with most of them are harder than  the conditions with most of us  but  thinking of certain englishmen  i have known  i should be ashamed to join in the cry of those  story telling americans whose jokes have sometimes fallen effectless   it is true that  wherever the celt has leavened the doughier anglo saxon  lump  the expectation of a humorous sympathy is greater  but there are  subtile spirits of teutonic origin whose fineness we cannot deny  whose  delicate gayety is of a sort which may well leave ours impeaching itself  of a heavier and grosser fibre     no doubt you must sometimes  and possibly oftenest  go more than  half way for the response to your humorous intention  those subtile  spirits are shy  and may not offer it an effusive welcome  they are  also of such an exquisite honesty that  if they do not think your wit  is funny  they will not smile at it  and this may grieve some of our  jokers  but  if you have something fine and good in you  you need not be  afraid they will fail of it  and they will not be so long about finding  it out as some travellers say  when it comes to the grace of the  imaginative in your pleasantry  they will be even beforehand with you   but in their extreme of impersonality they will leave the initiative to  you in the matter of humor as in others  they will no more seek out your  peculiar humor than they will name you in speaking with you       viii    nothing in england seeks you out  except the damp  your impressions  you  have to fight for them  what you see or hear seems of accident  the sort  of people you have read of your whole life  and are most intimate with  in fiction  you must surprise  they no more court observance than the  birds in whose seasonable slaughter society from the king down delights   in fact  it is probable that  if you looked for both  you would find the  gunner shyer than the gunned  the pheasant and the fox are bred to give  pleasure by their chase  they are tenderly cared for and watched over  and kept from harm at the hands of all who do not wish to kill them for  the joy of killing  and they are not so elusive but they can be seen by  easy chance  the pheasant especially has at times all but the boldness  of the barnyard in his fearless port  once from my passing train  i saw  him standing in the middle of a ploughed field  erect  distinct  like  a statue of himself  commemorative of the long ages in which his heroic  death and martyr sufferance have formed the pride of princes and the  peril of poachers  but i never once saw him shot  though almost as many  gunners pursue him as there are pheasants in the land  this alone shows  how shy the gunners are  and when once i saw the trail of a fox hunt  from the same coign of vantage without seeing the fox  i felt that i  had almost indecently come upon the horse and hounds  and that the pink  coats and the flowery spread of the dappled dogs over the field were  mine by a kind of sneak as base as killing a fox to save my hens       ix    equally with the foxes and the pheasants  the royalties and nobilities  abound in english novels  which really form the chief means of our  acquaintance with english life  but the chances that reveal them to the  average unintroduced  unpresented american are rarer  by these chances   i heard  out of the whole peerage  but one lord so addressed in public   and that was on a railroad platform where a porter was reassuring him  about his luggage  similarly  i once saw a lady of quality  a tall and  girlish she  who stood beside her husband  absently rubbing with her  glove the window of her motor  and whom but for the kind interest of our  cabman we might never have known for a duchess  it is by their personal  uninsistence largely  no doubt  that the monarchy and the aristocracy  exist  the figures of the faery dream remain blent with the background   and appear from it only when required to lay cornerstones  or preside at  races  or teas or bazars  or to represent the masses at home and abroad   and invisibly hold the viewless reins of government     yet it must not be supposed that the commoner sort of dreamers are never  jealous of these figments of their fancy  they are often so  and rouse  themselves to self assertion as frequently as our better element flings  off the yoke of tammany  at a fair  open to any who would pay  for  some forgotten good object  such as is always engaging the energies  of society  i saw moving among the paying guests the tall form of a  nobleman who had somehow made himself so distasteful to his neighbors  that they were not his friends  and regularly voted down his men   whether they stood for parliament or county council  and whether they  were better than the popular choice or not  as a matter of fact  it was  said that they were really better  but the people would not have them  because they were his  and one of the theories of english manliness  is that the constant pressure from above has toughened the spirit and  enabled englishmen to stand up stouter and straighter each in his place   just as it is contended elsewhere that the aesthetic qualities of the  human race have been heightened by its stresses and deprivations in the  struggle of life     for my own part  i believe neither the one theory nor the other  people  are the worse for having people above them  and are the ruder and  coarser for having to fight their way  if the triumph of social  inequality is such that there are not four men in london who are not  snobs  it cannot boast itself greater than the success of economic  inequality with ourselves  among whom the fight for money has not  produced of late a first class poet  painter  or sculptor  the english   if they are now the manliest people under the sun  have to thank not  their masters but themselves  and a nature originally so generous that  no abuse could lastingly wrong it  no political absurdity spoil it  but  if this nature had been left free from the beginning  we might see now a  nation of englishmen who  instead of being bound so hard and fast in  the bonds of an imperial patriotism  would be the first in a world wide  altruism  yet their patriotism is so devout that it may well pass itself  off upon them for a religious emotion  instead of the superstition which  seems to the stranger the implication of an england in the next world as  well as in this       x    we fancy that  because we have here an episcopal church  with its  hierarchy  we have something equivalent to the english church  but that  is a mistake  the english church is a part of the whole of english life   as the army or navy is  in english crowds  the national priest is not so  frequent as the national soldier  but he is of as marked a quality  and  as distinct from the civil world  in uniform  bearing  and aspect  in  the cathedral towns  he and his like form a sort of spiritual garrison   at home here you may be ignorant of the feasts of the episcopal church  without shame or inconvenience  but in england you had better be versed  in the incidence of all the holy days if you would stand well with  other men  and would know accurately when the changes in the railroad  time tables will take place  it will not do to have ascertained the  limits of lent  you must be up in the michaelmases and whitmondays   and the minor saints  days  when once you have mastered this  difficult science  you will realize what a colossal transaction the  disestablishment of the english church in england would be  and how it  would affect the whole social fabric     but  even when you have learned your lesson  it will not be to you as  that knowledge which has been lived  and which has no more need ever  to question itself than the habitual pronunciation of words  if one has  moved in good english society  one has no need ever to ask how a word is  pronounced  far less to go to the dictionary  one pronounces it as one  has always heard it pronounced  the sense of this gives the american a  sort of despair  like that of a german or french speaking foreigner  who  perceives that he never will be able to speak english  the american is  rather worse off  for he has to subdue an inward rebellion  and to form  even the wish to pronounce some english words as the english do  he  has  for example  always said  financier   with the accent on the last  syllable  and if he has consulted his webster he has found that there  was no choice for him  then  when he hears it pronounced at oxford by  the head of a college with the accent on the second syllable  and learns  on asking that it is never otherwise accented in england  his head  whirls a little  and he has a sick moment  in which he thinks he had  better let the verb  to be  govern the accusative as the english do   and be done with it  or else telegraph for his passage home at once  or  stop  he must not  telegraph   he must  wire        xi    as for that breathing in the wrong place which is known as dropping  one s aitches  i found that in the long time between the first and last  of my english sojourns  there had arisen the theory that it was a vice  purely cockney in origin  and that it had grown upon the nation through  the national schools  it is grossly believed  or boldly pretended  that  till the national school teachers had conformed to the london standard  in their pronunciation the wrong breathing was almost unknown in  england  but that now it was heard everywhere south of the scottish  border  worse yet  the teachers in the national schools had scattered  far and wide that peculiar intonation  that droll slip or twist of the  vowel sounds by which the cockney alone formerly proclaimed his low  breeding  and the infection is now spread as far as popular learning   like the wrong breathing  it is social death  to any he that utters it    not indeed that swift extinction which follows having your name crossed  by royalty from the list of guests at a house where royalty is about to  visit  but a slow  insidious malady  which preys upon its victim  and  finally destroys him after his life long struggle to shake it off  it is  even worse than the wrong breathing  and is destined to sweep the whole  island  where you can nowhere  even now  be quite safe from hearing  a woman call herself  a lydy   it may indeed be the contagion of the  national school teacher  but i feel quite sure  from long observation of  the wrong breathing  that the wrong breathing did not spread from london  through the schools  but was everywhere as surely characteristic of  the unbred in england as nasality is with us  both infirmities are of  national origin and extent  and both are individual or personal in their  manifestation  that is  some americans in every part of the union talk  through their noses  some englishmen in every part of the kingdom drop  their aitches     the english speaking welsh often drop their aitches  as the  english speaking french do  though the scotch and irish never drop them   any more than the americans  or the english of the second generation  among us  but the extremely interesting and great little people of wales  are otherwise as unlike the english as their mother language is  they  seem capable of doing anything but standing six feet in their stockings   which is such a very common achievement with the english  but that is  the fault of nature which gave them dark complexions and the english  fair  where the work of the spirit comes in  it effects such a  difference between the two peoples as lies between an eisteddfod and a  horse race  while all the singers of wales met in artistic emulation at  their national musical festival at rhyl  all the gamblers of england met  in the national pastime of playing the horses at doncaster  more money  probably changed hands on the events at doncaster than at rhyl  and it  was characteristic of the prevalent influence in the common civilization   if there is a civilization common to both races  that the king was at  doncaster and not at rhyl  but i do not say this to his disadvantage   for i was myself at doncaster and not at rhyl  you cannot  unless  you have a very practised ear  say which is the finer singer at an  eisteddfod  but almost any one can see which horse comes in first at a  race       xii    what is most striking in the mixture of strains in england is that it  apparently has not ultimately mixed them  and perhaps after a thousand  years the racial traits will be found marking americans as persistently   we now absorb  and suppose ourselves to be assimilating  the different  voluntary and involuntary immigrations  but doubtless after two thousand  years the african  the celt  the scandinavian  the teuton  the gaul   the hun  the latin  the slav will be found atavistically asserting his  origin in certain of their common posterity  the pennsylvania germans  have as stolidly maintained their identity for two centuries as the  welsh in great britain for twenty  or  so far as history knows  from  the beginning of time  the prejudices of one british stock concerning  another are as lively as ever  apparently  however the enmities may  have worn themselves away  one need not record any of these english  prejudices concerning the scotch or irish  they are too well known  but  i may set down the opinion of a lively companion in a railroad journey  that the welsh are  the prize liars of the universe   he was an expert  accountant by profession  and his affairs took him everywhere in the  three kingdoms  and this was his settled error  for the welsh themselves  know that  if they sometimes seem the prey of a lively imagination  it  is the philologically noted fault of their language  which refuses to  lend itself to the accurate expression of fact  but which would probably  afford them terms for pronouncing the statement of my accountant  inexact  he was perhaps a man of convictions rather than conclusions   for  though he was a bright intelligence  of unusually varied interests   there were things that had never appealed to him  we praised together  the lovely september landscape through which we were running  and i  ventured some remark upon the large holdings of the land  a thing that  always saddened me in the face of nature with the reflection that those  who tilled the soil owned none of it  though i ought to have remembered  the times when the soil owned them  and taken heart  my notion seemed to  strike him for the first time  but he dismissed the fact as a necessary  part of the english system  it had never occurred to him that there  could be question of that system  there must be many englishmen to whom  it does occur  but if you do not happen to meet them you cannot blame  the others     i fancied that one of the englishmen to whom it might have occurred was  he whom i met in wales at aberystwyth  where we spoke together a moment  in the shadow of the co educational university there  and who seemed at  least of a different mind concerning the welsh   these welsh farmers    he said   send their sons and daughters to college as if it were quite  the natural thing to do  but just imagine a dorsetshire peasant sending  his boy to a university      we suppose that the large holdings of land are the effect of wrongs and  abuses now wholly in the past  and that the causes for their increase  are no longer operative  but are something like those geological laws by  which the strata under them formed themselves  once  however  in driving  through the most beautiful part of england  which i will not specify  because every part of england is the most beautiful  i came upon an  illustration of the reverse  as signal as the spectacle of a landslide   it was the accumulation  not merely within men s memories  but within  the actual generation  of vast bodies of land in the hold of a great  nobleman who had contrived a title in them by the simple device of  enclosing the people s commons  it was a wrong  but there was no one of  the wronged who was brave enough or rich enough to dispute it through  the broken law  and no witness public spirited enough to come to  their aid  such things make us think patiently  almost proudly  of  our national foible of graft  which may really be of feudal origin   doubtless the aggression was attacked in the press  but we all know  what the attacks of the press amount to against the steadfast will of  a powerful corporation  and a great nobleman in england is a powerful  corporation  in this instance he had not apparently taken the people s  land without some wish to make them a return for it  he had built a  handsome road through their property  which he maintained in splendid  condition  and he allowed them to drive over his road  and to walk  freely in certain portions of their woods  he had also built a  magnificent hospital for them  and it seemed rather hard  then  to  hear that one of the humblest of them had been known to speak of him in  whispered confidence as a  upas tree        xiii    probably he was not personally a upas tree  probably the rancor toward  him left from being bawled after by one of his gatemen at a turning we  had taken in his enclosure   that s a private path   was unjust  there  was no sign  such as everywhere in england renders a place secure from  intrusion  the word  private  painted up anywhere does the effect of  bolts and bars and of all obsolete man traps beyond it  and is not for a  moment that challenge to the wayfaring foot which it seems so often  with us  but the warnings to the public which we make so mandatory  the  english language with unfailing gentleness  you are not told to keep  your foot or your wheel to a certain pathway  you are  requested    and sometimes even  kindly requested   i do not know but once i was   respectfully requested   perhaps that nobleman s possession of these  lands was so new that his retainers had to practise something of  unwonted rudeness in keeping it wholly his where he chose  at any rate   the rule of civility is so universal that the politeness from class to  class is  for what the stranger sees  all but unfailing  i dare say he  does not see everything  even the argus eyed american  but apparently  the manners of the lower class  where they have been touched by the  upper  have been softened and polished to the same consistence  and complexion  when it comes to the proffers  and refusals  and  insistences  and acceptances between people of condition  such as i  witnessed once in a crowded first class carriage from london on an  oxford holiday  nothing could be more gently urgent  more beautifully  forbearing  if the writers of our romantic novels could get just those  manners into their fiction  i should not mind their dealing so much with  the english nobility and gentry  for those who intend being our  nobility and gentry  by and by  could not do better than study such  high breeding     if we approach the morals of either superiors or inferiors  we are in  a region where it behooves us to tread carefully  to be honest  i know  nothing about them  and i will not assume to know anything  i heard from  authority which i could not suspect of posing for omniscience that the  english rustics were apt to be very depraved  but they may on the  other hand be saints for all that i can prove against them  they are  superstitious  it is said  and there are few villages or old houses  that have not their tutelary spectres  the belief in ghosts is almost  universal among the people  as i may allow without superiority  for i  do not know but i believe in them myself  and there are some million of  american spiritualists who make an open profession of faith in them  it  is said also that the poor in england are much spoiled by the constant  aid given them in charity  this is supposed to corrupt them  and to  make them dependent upon the favors of fortune  rather than the sweat of  their brows  on the other hand  they often cannot get work  as i infer  from the armies of the unemployed  and  in these cases  i cannot hold  them greatly to blame if they bless their givers by their readiness  to receive  if one may infer from the incessant beneficences  and the  constant demands for more and more charities  one heaped upon another   there are more good objects in england than anywhere else under the sun   for one only gives to good objects  of course  the oppression of the  subscriptions is tempered by the smallness of the sum which may satisfy  them   five shillings is a subscription   said a friend who was accused  of really always giving five pounds       xiv    the english rich do not give so spectacularly as our rich do  that  is  by handfuls of millions  but then the whole community gives more  i  think  than our community does  and when it does not give  the necessary  succor is taxed out of its incomes and legacies  i do not mean that  there is no destitution  but only that the better off seem to have the  worse off more universally and perpetually in mind than with us  all  this is believed to be very demoralizing to the poor  and doubtless the  certainty of soup and flannel is bad for the soul of an old woman whose  body is doubled up with rheumatism  the church seems to blame for  much of the evil that ensues from giving something to people who have  nothing  but i dare say the dissenters are also guilty     just how much is wanted to stay the stomach of a healthy pauper  it  would be hard to say  but now and then the wayfarer gets some hint of  the frequency if not the amount of feeding among the poor who are able  to feed themselves  one day  in the outskirts  they were very tattered  and draggled  of liverpool  we stopped at a pastry shop  where the kind  woman  thought she could accommodate  us with a cup of tea  though she  was terribly pressed with custom from all sorts of minute maids and  small boys coming in for  penn orths  of that frightful variety of tart  and cake which dismays the beholder from innumerable shop windows  in england  when we were brought our safer refection  we noted her  activities to the hostess  and she said   yes  they all want a bit  of cake with their tea  even the poorest   and when we ventured our  supposition that they made their afternoon tea the last meal of the day   she laughed at the notion   last meal  they have a good supper before  they go to bed  indeed  they all want their four meals a day      another time  thriftily running in a third class carriage from crewe to  chester  i was joined by a friendly man who addressed me with the frank  cordiality of the lower classes in recognizing one of their sort   they  don t know how to charge   he said  with an irony that referred to the  fourpence he had been obliged to pay for a cup of station tea  and when  i tried to allege some mitigating facts in behalf of the company  he  readily became autobiographical  the transition from tea to eating  generally was easy  and he told me that he was a plumber  going to do a  job of work at llandudno  where he had to pay fourteen bob  which i  knew to be shillings and mentally translated into        a week for  his board  his wages were       a day  which the reader who multiplies  fourpence by twenty  to make up the difference in money values  will  find to be the wages of a good mechanic in the first edward s time  five  hundred years ago  on this he professed to live very well  he rose  every morning at half past four  and at six he had a breakfast of bread   butter  and coffee  at nine he had porridge and coffee  at one  he had  soup  meat  and eggs  and perhaps beer  at night  after he got home from  work  he had a stew and a bit of meat  and perhaps beer  with mother  he  thought that english people ate too much  generally  and especially  on sunday  when they had nothing else to do  most men never came home  without asking   well  mother  what have you got for me to eat now    when i remembered how sparely our farm people and mechanics fared  i  thought that he was right  or they were wrong  for the puzzling fact  remained that they looked gaunt and dyspeptic  and he hale and fresh   though the difference may have had as much to do with the air as the  food  i liked him  and i cannot leave him without noting that he was of  the lean faced  slightly aquiline british type  with a light mustache   he was well dressed and well set up  and he spoke strongly  as north  britons do  with nothing of our people s husky whine  i found him on  further acquaintance of anti chamberlain politics  pro boer as to  the late war  and rather socialistic  he blamed the labor men for  not choosing labor men to office instead of the gentry who offered  themselves  he belonged to a plumbers  union  and he had nothing to  complain of  but he inferred that the working man was better off in  america  from the fact that none of his friends who had gone to the  states ever came home to stay  though they nearly all came home for  a holiday  sooner or later  he differed from my other friend  the  accountant  in being very fond of the welsh  it must be owned their race  seemed to have acquired merit with him through the tip of two sovereigns  which his last employer in llandudno had given him  on the other hand   he had no love for the italians who were coming in  especially at  glasgow  in glasgow  he said  there were more drunken women than  anywhere else in the world  though there was no public house drinking  with them as in london  this  so far as i got at it  formed his outlook  on life  but i dare say there was more of it       xv    i was always regretting that i got at the people so little  and that  only chance hints of what they were thinking and feeling reached me   now and then  a native observer said something about them which  seemed luminous   we are frightfully feudal   such an observer said    especially the poor   he did not think it a fault  i believe  and only  used his adverb intensifyingly  for he was of a tory mind  he meant the  poor among the country people  who have at last mastered that principle  of the feudal system which early enabled the great nobles to pay nothing  for the benefits they enjoyed from it  but my other friend  the plumber   was not the least feudal  or not so feudal as many a lowly ward heeler  in new york  who helps to make up the muster of some captain of  politics  under the lead of a common boss  the texture of society  in  the smarter sense  the narrower sense  is what i could not venture to  speak of more confidently  once i asked a friend  a very dear and valued  friend  whether a man s origin or occupation would make any difference  in his social acceptance  if he were otherwise interesting and  important  he seemed not to know what i would be at  and  when he  understood  he responded with almost a shout of amazement   oh  not the  least in the world   but i have my doubts still  and i should say that  it might be as difficult for a very cultivated and agreeable man servant  to get on in london society  as for an artist or poet to feel at home  in the first circles of new york  possibly  however  london society   because of its almost immeasurable vastness  can take in more of more  sorts of people  without the consciousness of differences which keeps  our own first circles so elect  i venture  somewhat wildly  somewhat  unwarrantably  the belief that english society is less sensitive to  moral differences than ours  and that people with their little  taches   would find less anxiety in london than in new york lest they should come  off on the people they rubbed against  some americans  who  even with  our increasing prevalence of divorces  are not well seen at home  are  cheerfully welcomed in england     perhaps  there  all americans  good and bad  high and low  coarse and  fine  are the same to senses not accustomed to our varying textures  and shades of color  that is a matter i should be glad to remand to the  psychologist  who will have work enough to do if he comes to inquire  into such mysteries  one can never be certain just how the english take  us  or how much  or whether they take us at all  oftenest i was inclined  to think that we were imperceptible to them  or that  when we were  perceptible  they were aware of us as swedenborg says the most celestial  angels are aware of evil spirits  merely as something angular  americans  were distressful to their consciousness  they did not know why  and  then they tried to ignore us  but perhaps this is putting it a little  fantastically  what i know is that one comes increasingly to reserve the  fact of one s nationality  when it is not essential to the occasion  and  to become as much as possible an unknown quality  rather than a quality  aggressive or positive  sometimes  when i could feel certain of my  ground  i ventured my conviction that englishmen were not so much  interested in americans as those americans who stayed at home were apt  to think  but when i once expressed this belief to a unitarian minister   whom i met in the west of england  he received it with surprise and  refusal  he said that in his own immediate circle  at least  his friends  were interested and increasingly interested in america  what she was  and what she meant to be  and still looked toward her for the lead  in certain high things which englishmen have ceased to expect of  themselves  my impression is that most of the most forward of the  english sociologists regard america as a back number in those political  economics which imply equality as well as liberty in the future  they do  not see any difference between our conditions and theirs  as regards  the man who works for his living with his hands  except that wages are  higher with us  and that physically there is more elbow room  though  mentally and morally there is not  save a little in my unitarian  minister  and this only conjecturally  i did not encounter that fine  spirit which in old england used to imagine the new world we have not  quite turned out to be  but once i met an englishman who had lived  in canada  and who  gentleman bred as he was  looked back with fond  homesickness to the woods where he had taken up land  and built himself  a personable house  chiefly with his own hands  he had lived himself out  of touch with his old english life in that new country  and had drawn  breath in an opener and livelier air which filled his lungs as the home  atmosphere never could again       xvi    yet he was standing stiffly up for himself  and strewing his  convictions and opinions broadcast as the english all do when pressed  by circumstance  while we  with none of their shyness  mostly think our  thoughts to ourselves  i suppose we do it because we like better than  they to seem of one effect with the rest of our kind  in england one  sees a variety of dress in men which one rarely sees at home  they dress  there not only in keeping with their work and their play  but in the  indulgence of any freak of personal fancy  so that in the street of a  provincial town  like bath  for instance  you will encounter in a short  walk a greater range of trousers  leggings  caps  hats  coats  jackets   collars  scarfs  boots and shoes  of tan and black  than you would meet  at home in a month of sundays  the differences do not go to the length  of fashions  such as reduce our differences to uniformity  and clothe   say  our legs in knickerbockers till it is found everybody is wearing  them  when immediately nobody wears them  only ladies  of fashions  beyond men s  gratify caprices like ours  and even these perhaps not  voluntarily  in the obedience they show to the rule that they must never  wear the same dinner or ball gown twice  it was said  but who can ever  find out the truth of such things   that they sometimes had sent home  from the dressmaker s a number of dresses on liking  and wore them in  succession  only to return them  all but one at least  as not liked  the  dressmaker having found her account in her work being shown in society      illustration  an english housemaid     i do not know just what is to be inferred from a social fact or  statement like this  but i may say that the devotion to an ideal of  social position is far deeper with the english than with us  whether  we spend more or not  i believe that the english live much nearer their  incomes than americans do  i think that we save more out of our  earnings than they out of theirs  and that in this we are more like the  continental peoples  the french or the italians  they spend vastly more  on state than we do  because  for one thing  they have more state to  spend on  a man may continue to make money in america  and not change  his manner of living till he chooses  and he may never change it  such  a thing could not happen to an englishwoman as happened to the elderly  american housewife who walked through the magnificent house which her  husband had bought to surprise her  and sighed out at last   well  now i  suppose i shall have to keep a girl   the girl would have been kept  from the beginning of her husband s prosperity  and multiplied  till  the house was full of servants  if you have the means of a gentleman  in england  you must live like a gentleman  apparently  you cannot live  plainly  and put by  and largely you must trust to your life insurance  as the fortune you will leave your heirs  it cannot be denied that the  more generous expenditure of the english adds to the grace of life  and  that they are more hospitable according to their means than we are  or  than those continental peoples who are not hospitable at all     a thing that one feels more and more irritatingly in england is that   while with other foreigners we stand on common ground  where we may be  as unlike them as we choose  with the english we always stand on english  ground  where we can differ only at our peril  and to our disadvantage   a person speaking english and bearing an english name  had better be  english  for if he cannot it shows  it proves  that there is something  wrong in him  our misfortune is that our tradition  and perhaps our  inclination  obliges us to be un english  whereas we do not trouble  ourselves to be un french  or un italian  for we are so by nature  the  effort involved in distinguishing ourselves breeds a sort of annoyance   or call it no more than uneasiness  which is almost as bad as a bad  conscience  and in our sense of hopeless perdition we turn vindictively  upon our judge  but that is not fair and it is not wise  he does not  mean to be our judge  except when he comes to us for the purpose  in his  own house  he is civilly unaware of putting us to any test whatever  if  you ask him whether he likes this thing or that of ours  he will tell  you frankly  he never can see why he should not be frank  he has a kind  of helplessness in always speaking the truth  and he does not try to  make it palatable       xvii    an english radical  who would say of his king no more than that he was  a good little man  and most useful in promoting friendship with france   was inclined to blame us because we did not stay by at the time of our  revolution  and help them fight out as englishmen the fight for english  freedom  he had none of the loyalty of sentiment which so mystifies the  american  but plenty of the loyalty of reason  and expected a utopia  which should not be of political but of economical cast  but one was  always coming upon illustrations of the loyalty of sentiment with  which of course one could have no quarrel  for their patriotism seldom  concerned us  except rather handsomely to include us  the french have  ceased to be the hereditary enemy  and the russians have now taken their  place in the popular patriotism  i always talked with the lower classes  when i could  perhaps because i felt myself near them in my unworthy  way  and one evening in a grassy lane i made the acquaintance of a  friendly man letting his horse browse the wayside turf  he was in the  livery stable line  but he had been a soldier many years  upon this  episode he became freely autobiographical  especially concerning his  service in india  he volunteered the declaration that he had had enough  of war  but he added  thoughtfully   i should like to go out for a  couple of years if there was any trouble with russia      the love of england comes out charmingly in the swarming of english  tourists in every part of their country  americans may sometimes  outnumber them at the continental shrines  but we are in a pitiful  minority at the memorable places in england  in fact  we are nowhere  beside the natives  i liked their fondness for their own so much that  i never could feel the fine scorn for  trippers  which i believe all  persons of condition ought to assume  even when the trippers did  not seem very intelligently interested in what they saw  they were  harmlessly employed  for a scene of beauty  or of historic appeal  could  not be desecrated by the courtships which are constantly going on all  over england  especially at the holiday seasons     the english are  indeed  great holiday makers  even when past the age  of putting their arms around one another s waists  the many and many  seaside resorts form the place of their favorite outings  where they try  to spend such days and weeks of the late summer as their savings will  pay for  it is said that families in very humble station save the year  round for these vacations  and  having put by twelve or fifteen pounds   repair to some such waterside as blackpool  or its analogue in their  neighborhood  and lavish them upon the brief joy of the time  they  take the cheaper lodgings  and bring with them the less perishable  provisions  and lead a life of resolute gayety on the sands and in the  sea  and at the pier ends where the negro minstrels and the pierrots   who equally abound  make the afternoons and evenings a delight which no  one would suspect from their faces to be the wild thing it is  if they  go home at the end  high sorrowful and cloyed   there is no forecast of  it in their demeanor  which is as little troubled as it is animated   the young people are even openly gay  and the robustness of their  flirtations adds sensibly to the interest of the spectator  our own  public lovers seem of a humbler sort  and they mostly content themselves  with the passive embraces of which every seat in our parks affords an  example  but in england such lovers add playful struggles  a favorite  pastime seemed to be for one of them to hold something in the hand  and  for the other to try prying it open  when it was the young man who kept  his hand shut  the struggle could go on almost indefinitely  i suppose  it led to many engagements and marriages     when the young people were not walking up and down  or playfully  scuffling  they were reading novels  in fact  i do not imagine that  anywhere else in the world is there a half  or a tenth part  so much  fiction consumed as in the english summer resorts  it is probably of the  innutritious lightness of pop corn  i had never the courage to look at  the volumes which i could so easily have overlooked  but i am sure it  was all out of the circulating library  as there were often several  young women to one man  most of the girls had to content themselves  with the flirtations in the books  where  i dare say  the heroines  were always prying the heroes  hands open  on every seat one found them  poring upon the glowing page  and met them in every walk with a volume  under the arm  and another clasped to the heart  at places where the  hand played  and they were ostensibly listening to the music  they were  bowed upon their books  and the flutter of the turning leaves almost  silenced the blare of the horns  by what inspiration they knew when  god  save the king  was coming  and rose with a long sigh heaved in common   i should not be able to say  perhaps they always reached the end of a  story at the time the band came to that closing number  or perhaps they  felt its imminence in their nerves  the fiction was not confined to the  young girls  however  both sexes and all ages partook of it  i saw as  many old girls as young girls reading novels  and mothers of families  were apparently as much addicted to the indulgence  i suppose they put  by their books when they took tea  which is the other most noticeable  dissipation in england  but i cannot enter upon that chapter  it is  too large a theme  i will say  merely  that as the saloons are on sixth  avenue  so the tearooms are in every part of the island      illustration  leads a life of gayety on the sands       xviii    it had seemed to me in former visits to england that the christian  sabbath was a more depressing day there than here  but from the last  i have a more cheerful memory of it  i still felt it dispiriting in  london  where as many fled from it as could  and where the empty streets  symbolized a world abandoned to destruction  but this was mainly in the  forenoon  even then  the markets and fairs in the avenues given up to  them were the scenes of an activity which was not without gayety  and  certainly not without noise  and when the afternoon came  the lower  classes  such as had remained in town  thronged to the public houses   and the upper classes to the evening parade in the park  as to the  relative amount of church going  i will not even assume to be sure  but  i have a fancy that it is a rite much less rigorous than it used to  be  still  in provincial places  i found the churches full on a sunday  morning  and all who could afford it hallowed the day by putting on  a frock coat and a top hat  which are not worn outside of london on  week days  the women  of course  were always in their best on sunday   perhaps in the very country the upper classes go to church as much as  formerly  but i have my doubts whether they feel so much obliged to it  in conformity to usage  or for the sake of example to their inferiors   where there are abbeys and minsters and cathedrals  as there are pretty  well everywhere in england  religion is an attractive spectacle  and one  could imagine people resorting to its functions for aesthetic reasons     but  in these guesses  one must remember that the english who remained  at home were never puritanized  never in such measure personally  conscienced  as those who came to america in the times of the successive  protestant fervors  and that is a thing which we are apt to forget  the  home keeping english continued  with changes of ritual  much like the  peoples who still acknowledged as their head  the bishop of rome    their greater morality  if it was greater  was temperamental rather than  spiritual  and  leaving the church to look after religion much more than  our puritans did  they kept a simplicity of nature impossible to the  sectaries always taking stock of their souls  in fact  the calvinists  of new england were almost essentially different from the calvinists of  holland  of france  even of scotland  if our ancestors were the children  of light  as they trusted  they were darkened by the forest  into which  they plunged  to certain reasons which the children of darkness  as the  puritans believed the non puritans to be  saw by the uncertain glimmers  from the world about them  there is no denying that with certain great  gains  the american puritans became  in a worldly sense  provincialized   and that if they lived in the spirit  they lived in it narrowly  while  the others  who lived in the body  lived in it liberally  or at any rate  handsomely  from our narrowness we flattered ourselves that we were able  to imagine a life more broadly based than theirs  or at least a life  from which theirs must look insufficient and unfinal  so long as man  feels within himself the prompting to be something better or higher than  he is  yet the english life is wonderfully perfected  with a faery  dream of a king supported in his preeminence by a nobility  a nobility  supported in turn by a commonalty  a commonalty supported again by a  proletariat resting upon immeasurable ether  with a system of government  kept  by assent so general that the dissent does not matter  in the  hands of a few families reared  if not trained  to power  with a society  so intimately and thoroughly self acquainted that one touch of gossip  makes its whole world kin  and responsive to a single emotion  with a  charity so wisely studied  and so carefully applied  that restive misery  never quite grows rebellious  with a patriotism so inborn and ingrained  that all things english seem righteous because english  with a  willingness to share the general well being quite to the verge  but  never beyond the verge  of public control of the administration  with  all this  the thing must strike the unbelieving observer as desperately  perfect   they have got it down cold   he must say to himself  and  confirm himself in his unfaith by reflecting that it is very cold       xix    the best observer of england that ever was  he whose book about the  english makes all other comment seem idle and superfluous palaver  that  ralph waldo emerson whom we always find ahead of us when we look back  for him  was once  as he relates in a closing chapter of english traits   brought to bay by certain great english friends of his  who challenged  him to say whether there really were any americans with an american  idea  and a theory of our future   thus challenged  i bethought myself  neither of congress  neither of president nor of cabinet ministers  nor  of such as would make of america another europe     i opened the dogma  of no government and non resistance  and anticipated the objections and  the fun  and procured a kind of hearing for it  i said  it is true that  i have never yet seen in any country a man of sufficient valor to stand  for this truth  and yet      tis certain  as god liveth  the gun that  does not need another gun  the law of love and justice alone  can effect  a clean revolution     i insisted     that the manifest absurdity of  the view to english feasibility could make no difference to a gentleman   that as to our secure tenure of our mutton chop and spinach in london  or in boston  the soul might quote talleyrand    messieurs  je n en  vois pas la necessite     in other words  emerson laid before his  great english friends a programme  as nearly as might then be  of  philosophical anarchism  and naturally it met with no more acceptance  than it would if now presented to the most respectable of his american  readers  yet it is never to be forgotten that it was the english who   with all their weight of feudal tradition  and amidst the nightmares to  which their faery dream seemed so long subject  invented the only form  of democratic christianity the world has yet known  unless indeed the  german mennonites are the same as the earlier english quakers were in  creed and life  in the pseudo republic of the cromwellian commonwealth  the english had a state as wholly without liberty  equality  and  fraternity as in the king capped oligarchy they had before and have  had ever since  we may be sure that they will never have such another  commonwealth  or any resembling ours  which can no longer offer itself  as an eminent example     the sort of englishmen  of whose respect americans can make surest are  those english thick and thin patriots who admire force and strength  and  believe that it is the anglo saxon mission to possess the earth  and  to profit by its weaker peoples  not cruelly  not unkindly  yet  unquestionably  the englishmen of whose disrespect we can make surest  are those who expect to achieve liberty  equality  and fraternity in the  economic way  the political way having failed  who do not care whether  the head of the state is born or elected  is called  king  or called   president   since he will presently not be at all  who abhor war  and  believe that the meek shall inherit the earth  and these only if they  work for a living  they have already had their will with the existing  english state  until now that state is far more the servant of the  people in fetching and carrying  in guarding them from hard masters  and succoring them in their need  than the republic which professes  to derive its just powers from the consent of the governed  when one  encounters this sort of englishman  one thinks silently of the child  labor in the south  of the monopolies in the north  of the companies  which govern while they serve us  and one hopes that the englishman is  not silently thinking of them too  he is probably of the lower classes   and one consoles one s self as one can by holding one s head higher in  better company  where  without secret self contempt  one can be more  openly proud of our increasing fortunes and our increasing territory   and our warlike adequacy to a first position among the nations of  the world  there is no fear that in such company one s national  susceptibilities will be wounded  or that one will not be almost as much  admired for one s money as at home  i do not say quite  because there  are still things in england even more admired than money  certainly  a very rich american would be considered in such english society   but certainly he would not be so much considered as an equally rich  englishman who was also a duke     i cannot name a nobleman of less rank  because i will not belittle my  rich countryman  but perhaps the english would think differently  and  would look upon him as lower than the latest peer or the newest knight  of the king s creation  the king  who has no power  can do almost  anything in england  and his touch  which is no longer sovereign for  scrofula  can add dignity and give absolute standing to a man whose  achievements merit it  but who with us would fail of anything like it   the english system is more logical than ours  but not so reasonable  the  english have seen from the beginning inequality and the rule of the few   we can hardly prove that we see  in the future  equality and the rule  of the many  yet our vision is doubtless prophetic  whatever obliquities  our frequent astigmatism may impart to it  meantime  in its ampler range  there is room for the play of any misgiving short of denial  but the  english cannot doubt the justice of what they have seen without forming  an eccentric relation to the actual fact  the englishman who refuses the  formal recognition of his distinction by his prince is the anomaly   not the englishman who accepts it  gladstone who declines a peerage is  anomalous  not tennyson who takes it  as part of the english system  as  a true believer in the oligarchically administered monarchy  gladstone  was illogical  and tennyson was logical       the end                    of solid  courses of scriptural quotations  welded together with a thin mortar of  originality  and from the summit of this she delivered a grim chapter  of the mosaic law  as from sinai     then tom girded up his loins  so to speak  and went to work to  get  his verses   sid had learned his lesson days before  tom bent all his  energies to the memorizing of five verses  and he chose part of the  sermon on the mount  because he could find no verses that were shorter   at the end of half an hour tom had a vague general idea of his lesson   but no more  for his mind was traversing the whole field of human  thought  and his hands were busy with distracting recreations  mary  took his book to hear him recite  and he tried to find his way through  the fog      blessed are the  a  a        poor        yes  poor  blessed are the poor  a  a        in spirit        in spirit  blessed are the poor in spirit  for they  they        theirs        for theirs  blessed are the poor in spirit  for theirs is the kingdom  of heaven  blessed are they that mourn  for they  they        sh        for they  a        s  h  a        for they s  h  oh  i don t know what it is

me  mary   what do you  want to be so mean for       oh  tom  you poor thick headed thing  i m not teasing you  i wouldn t  do that  you must go and learn it again  don t you be discouraged  tom   you ll manage it  and if you do  i ll give you something ever so nice   there  now  that s a good boy       all right  what is it  mary  tell me what it is       never you mind  tom  you know if i say it s nice  it is nice       you bet you that s so  mary  all right  i ll tackle it again      and he did  tackle it again   and under the double pressure of  curiosity and prospective gain he did it with such spirit that he  accomplished a shining success  mary gave him a brand new  barlow   knife worth twelve and a half cents  and the convulsion of delight that  swept his system shook him to his foundations  true  the knife would  not cut anything  but it was a  sure enough  barlow  and there was  inconceivable grandeur in that  though where the western boys ever got  the idea that such a weapon could possibly be counterfeited to its  injury is an imposing mystery and will always remain so  perhaps  tom  contrived to scarify the cupboard with it  and was arranging to begin  on the bureau  when he was called off to dress for sunday school     mary gave him a tin basin of water and a piece of soap  and he went  outside the door and set the basin on a little bench there  then he  dipped the soap in the water and laid it down  turned up his sleeves   poured out the water on the ground  gently  and then entered the  kitchen and began to wipe his face diligently on the towel behind the  door  but mary removed the towel and said      now ain t you ashamed  tom  you mustn t be so bad  water won t hurt  you      tom was a trifle disconcerted  the basin was refilled  and this time  he stood over it a little while  gathering resolution  took in a big  breath and began  when he entered the kitchen presently  with both eyes  shut and groping for the towel with his hands  an honorable testimony  of suds and water was dripping from his face  but when he emerged from  the towel  he was not yet satisfactory  for the clean territory stopped  short at his chin and his jaws  like a mask  below and beyond this line  there was a dark expanse of unirrigated soil that spread downward in  front and backward around his neck  mary took him in hand  and when she  was done with him he was a man and a brother  without distinction of  color  and his saturated hair was neatly brushed  and its short curls  wrought into a dainty and symmetrical general effect   he privately  smoothed out the curls  with labor and difficulty  and plastered his  hair close down to his head  for he held curls to be effeminate  and  his own filled his life with bitterness   then mary got out a suit of  his clothing that had been used only on sundays during two years  they  were simply called his  other clothes   and so by that we know the  size of his wardrobe  the girl  put him to rights  after he had dressed  himself  she buttoned his neat roundabout up to his chin  turned his  vast shirt collar down over his shoulders  brushed him off and crowned  him with his speckled straw hat  he now looked exceedingly improved and  uncomfortable  he was fully as uncomfortable as he looked  for there  was a restraint about whole clothes and cleanliness that galled him  he  hoped that mary would forget his shoes  but the hope was blighted  she  coated them thoroughly with tallow  as was the custom  and brought them  out  he lost his temper and said he was always being made to do  everything he didn t want to do  but mary said  persuasively      please  tom  that s a good boy      so he got into the shoes snarling  mary was soon ready  and the three  children set out for sunday school  a place that tom hated with his  whole heart  but sid and mary were fond of it     sabbath school hours were from nine to half past ten  and then church  service  two of the children always remained for the sermon  voluntarily  and the other always remained too  for stronger reasons   the church s high backed  uncushioned pews would seat about three  hundred persons  the edifice was but a small  plain affair  with a sort  of pine board tree box on top of it for a steeple  at the door tom  dropped back a step and accosted a sunday dressed comrade      say  billy  got a yaller ticket       yes       what ll you take for her       what ll you give       piece of lickrish and a fish hook       less see  em      tom exhibited  they were satisfactory  and the property changed hands   then tom traded a couple of white alleys for three red tickets  and  some small trifle or other for a couple of blue ones  he waylaid other  boys as they came  and went on buying tickets of various colors ten or  fifteen minutes longer  he entered the church  now  with a swarm of  clean and noisy boys and girls  proceeded to his seat and started a  quarrel with the first boy that came handy  the teacher  a grave   elderly man  interfered  then turned his back a moment and tom pulled a  boy s hair in the next bench  and was absorbed in his book when the boy  turned around  stuck a pin in another boy  presently  in order to hear  him say  ouch   and got a new reprimand from his teacher  tom s whole  class were of a pattern  restless  noisy  and troublesome  when they  came to recite their lessons  not one of them knew his verses  perfectly  but had to be prompted all along  however  they worried  through  and each got his reward  in small blue tickets  each with a  passage of scripture on it  each blue ticket was pay for two verses of  the recitation  ten blue tickets equalled a red one  and could be  exchanged for it  ten red tickets equalled a yellow one  for ten yellow  tickets the superintendent gave a very plainly bound bible  worth forty  cents in those easy times  to the pupil  how many of my readers would  have the industry and application to memorize two thousand verses  even  for a dore bible  and yet mary had acquired two bibles in this way  it  was the patient work of two years  and a boy of german parentage had  won four or five  he once recited three thousand verses without  stopping  but the strain upon his mental faculties was too great  and  he was little better than an idiot from that day forth  a grievous  misfortune for the school  for on great occasions  before company  the  superintendent  as tom expressed it  had always made this boy come out  and  spread himself   only the older pupils managed to keep their  tickets and stick to their tedious work long enough to get a bible  and  so the delivery of one of these prizes was a rare and noteworthy  circumstance  the successful pupil was so great and conspicuous for  that day that on the spot every scholar s heart was fired with a fresh  ambition that often lasted a couple of weeks  it is possible that tom s  mental stomach had never really hungered for one of those prizes  but  unquestionably his entire being had for many a day longed for the glory  and the eclat that came with it     in due course the superintendent stood up in front of the pulpit  with  a closed hymn book in his hand and his forefinger inserted between its  leaves  and commanded attention  when a sunday school superintendent  makes his customary little speech  a hymn book in the hand is as  necessary as is the inevitable sheet of music in the hand of a singer  who stands forward on the platform and sings a solo at a concert    though why  is a mystery  for neither the hymn book nor the sheet of  music is ever referred to by the sufferer  this superintendent was a  slim creature of thirty five  with a sandy goatee and short sandy hair   he wore a stiff standing collar whose upper edge almost reached his  ears and whose sharp points curved forward abreast the corners of his  mouth  a fence that compelled a straight lookout ahead  and a turning  of the whole body when a side view was required  his chin was propped  on a spreading cravat which was as broad and as long as a bank note   and had fringed ends  his boot toes were turned sharply up  in the  fashion of the day  like sleigh runners  an effect patiently and  laboriously produced by the young men by sitting with their toes  pressed against a wall for hours together  mr  walters was very earnest  of mien  and very sincere and honest at heart  and he held sacred  things and places in such reverence  and so separated them from worldly  matters  that unconsciously to himself his sunday school voice had  acquired a peculiar intonation which was wholly absent on week days  he  began after this fashion      now  children  i want you all to sit up just as straight and pretty  as you can and give me all your attention for a minute or two  there    that is it  that is the way good little boys and girls should do  i see  one little girl who is looking out of the window  i am afraid she  thinks i am out there somewhere  perhaps up in one of the trees making  a speech to the little birds   applausive titter   i want to tell you  how good it makes me feel to see so many bright  clean little faces  assembled in a place like this  learning to do right and be good   and  so forth and so on  it is not necessary to set down the rest of the  oration  it was of a pattern which does not vary  and so it is familiar  to us all     the latter third of the speech was marred by the resumption of fights  and other recreations among certain of the bad boys  and by fidgetings  and whisperings that extended far and wide  washing even to the bases  of isolated and incorruptible rocks like sid and mary  but now every  sound ceased suddenly  with the subsidence of mr  walters  voice  and  the conclusion of the speech was received with a burst of silent  gratitude     a good part of the whispering had been occasioned by an event which  was more or less rare  the entrance of visitors  lawyer thatcher   accompanied by a very feeble and aged man  a fine  portly  middle aged  gentleman with iron gray hair  and a dignified lady who was doubtless  the latter s wife  the lady was leading a child  tom had been restless  and full of chafings and repinings  conscience smitten  too  he could  not meet amy lawrence s eye  he could not brook her loving gaze  but  when he saw this small new comer his soul was all ablaze with bliss in  a moment  the next moment he was  showing off  with all his might    cuffing boys  pulling hair  making faces  in a word  using every art  that seemed likely to fascinate a girl and win her applause  his  exaltation had but one alloy  the memory of his humiliation in this  angel s garden  and that record in sand was fast washing out  under  the waves of happiness that were sweeping over it now     the visitors were given the highest seat of honor  and as soon as mr   walters  speech was finished  he introduced them to the school  the  middle aged man turned out to be a prodigious personage  no less a one  than the county judge  altogether the most august creation these  children had ever looked upon  and they wondered what kind of material  he was made of  and they half wanted to hear him roar  and were half  afraid he might  too  he was from constantinople  twelve miles away  so  he had travelled  and seen the world  these very eyes had looked upon  the county court house  which was said to have a tin roof  the awe  which these reflections inspired was attested by the impressive silence  and the ranks of staring eyes  this was the great judge thatcher   brother of their own lawyer  jeff thatcher immediately went forward  to  be familiar with the great man and be envied by the school  it would  have been music to his soul to hear the whisperings      look at him  jim  he s a going up there  say  look  he s a going to  shake hands with him  he is shaking hands with him  by jings  don t you  wish you was jeff      mr  walters fell to  showing off   with all sorts of official  bustlings and activities  giving orders  delivering judgments   discharging directions here  there  everywhere that he could find a  target  the librarian  showed off   running hither and thither with his  arms full of books and making a deal of the splutter and fuss that  insect authority delights in  the young lady teachers  showed off     bending sweetly over pupils that were lately being boxed  lifting  pretty warning fingers at bad little boys and patting good ones  lovingly  the young gentlemen teachers  showed off  with small  scoldings and other little displays of authority and fine attention to  discipline  and most of the teachers  of both sexes  found business up  at the library  by the pulpit  and it was business that frequently had  to be done over again two or three times  with much seeming vexation    the little girls  showed off  in various ways  and the little boys   showed off  with such diligence that the air was thick with paper wads  and the murmur of scufflings  and above it all the great man sat and  beamed a majestic judicial smile upon all the house  and warmed himself  in the sun of his own grandeur  for he was  showing off   too     there was only one thing wanting to make mr  walters  ecstasy  complete  and that was a chance to deliver a bible prize and exhibit a  prodigy  several pupils had a few yellow tickets  but none had enough    he had been around among the star pupils inquiring  he would have given  worlds  now  to have that german lad back again with a sound mind     and now at this moment  when hope was dead  tom sawyer came forward  with nine yellow tickets  nine red tickets  and ten blue ones  and  demanded a bible  this was a thunderbolt out of a clear sky  walters  was not expecting an application from this source for the next ten  years  but there was no getting around it  here were the certified  checks  and they were good for their face  tom was therefore elevated  to a place with the judge and the other elect  and the great news was  announced from headquarters  it was the most stunning surprise of the  decade  and so profound was the sensation that it lifted the new hero  up to the judicial one s altitude  and the school had two marvels to  gaze upon in place of one  the boys were all eaten up with envy  but  those that suffered the bitterest pangs were those who perceived too  late that they themselves had contributed to this hated splendor by  trading tickets to tom for the wealth he had amassed in selling  whitewashing privileges  these despised themselves  as being the dupes  of a wily fraud  a guileful snake in the grass     the prize was delivered to tom with as much effusion as the  superintendent could pump up under the circumstances  but it lacked  somewhat of the true gush  for the poor fellow s instinct taught him  that there was a mystery here that could not well bear the light   perhaps  it was simply preposterous that this boy had warehoused two  thousand sheaves of scriptural wisdom on his premises  a dozen would  strain his capacity  without a doubt     amy lawrence was proud and glad  and she tried to make tom see it in  her face  but he wouldn t look  she wondered  then she was just a grain  troubled  next a dim suspicion came and went  came again  she watched   a furtive glance told her worlds  and then her heart broke  and she was  jealous  and angry  and the tears came and she hated everybody  tom  most of all  she thought      tom was introduced to the judge  but his tongue was tied  his breath  would hardly come  his heart quaked  partly because of the awful  greatness of the man  but mainly because he was her parent  he would  have liked to fall down and worship him  if it were in the dark  the  judge put his hand on tom s head and called him a fine little man  and  asked him what his name was  the boy stammered  gasped  and got it out      tom       oh  no  not tom  it is        thomas       ah  that s it  i thought there was more to it  maybe  that s very  well  but you ve another one i daresay  and you ll tell it to me  won t  you       tell the gentleman your other name  thomas   said walters   and say  sir  you mustn t forget your manners       thomas sawyer  sir       that s it  that s a good boy  fine boy  fine  manly little fellow   two thousand verses is a great many  very  very great many  and you  never can be sorry for the trouble you took to learn them  for  knowledge is worth more than anything there is in the world  it s what  makes great men and good men  you ll be a great man and a good man  yourself  some day  thomas  and then you ll look back and say  it s all  owing to the precious sunday school privileges of my boyhood  it s all  owing to my dear teachers that taught me to learn  it s all owing to  the good superintendent  who encouraged me  and watched over me  and  gave me a beautiful bible  a splendid elegant bible  to keep and have  it all for my own  always  it s all owing to right bringing up  that is  what you will say  thomas  and you wouldn t take any money for those  two thousand verses  no indeed you wouldn t  and now you wouldn t mind  telling me and this lady some of the things you ve learned  no  i know  you wouldn t  for we are proud of little boys that learn  now  no  doubt you know the names of all the twelve disciples  won t you tell us  the names of the first two that were appointed      tom was tugging at a button hole and looking sheepish  he blushed   now  and his eyes fell  mr  walters  heart sank within him  he said to  himself  it is not possible that the boy can answer the simplest  question  why did the judge ask him  yet he felt obliged to speak up  and say      answer the gentleman  thomas  don t be afraid      tom still hung fire      now i know you ll tell me   said the lady   the names of the first  two disciples were        david and goliah      let us draw the curtain of charity over the rest of the scene         chapter v    about half past ten the cracked bell of the small church began to  ring  and presently the people began to gather for the morning sermon   the sunday school children distributed themselves about the house and  occupied pews with their parents  so as to be under supervision  aunt  polly came  and tom and sid and mary sat with her  tom being placed  next the aisle  in order that he might be as far away from the open  window and the seductive outside summer scenes as possible  the crowd  filed up the aisles  the aged and needy postmaster  who had seen better  days  the mayor and his wife  for they had a mayor there  among other  unnecessaries  the justice of the peace  the widow douglass  fair   smart  and forty  a generous  good hearted soul and well to do  her  hill mansion the only palace in the town  and the most hospitable and  much the most lavish in the matter of festivities that st  petersburg  could boast  the bent and venerable major and mrs  ward  lawyer  riverson  the new notable from a distance  next the belle of the  village  followed by a troop of lawn clad and ribbon decked young  heart breakers  then all the young clerks in town in a body  for they  had stood in the vestibule sucking their cane heads  a circling wall of  oiled and simpering admirers  till the last girl had run their gantlet   and last of all came the model boy  willie mufferson  taking as heedful  care of his mother as if she were cut glass  he always brought his  mother to church  and was the pride of all the matrons  the boys all  hated him  he was so good  and besides  he had been  thrown up to them   so much  his white handkerchief was hanging out of his pocket behind  as  usual on sundays  accidentally  tom had no handkerchief  and he looked  upon boys who had as snobs     the congregation being fully assembled  now  the bell rang once more   to warn laggards and stragglers  and then a solemn hush fell upon the  church which was only broken by the tittering and whispering of the  choir in the gallery  the choir always tittered and whispered all  through service  there was once a church choir that was not ill bred   but i have forgotten where it was  now  it was a great many years ago   and i can scarcely remember anything about it  but i think it was in  some foreign country     the minister gave out the hymn  and read it through with a relish  in  a peculiar style which was much admired in that part of the country   his voice began on a medium key and climbed steadily up till it reached  a certain point  where it bore with strong emphasis upon the topmost  word and then plunged down as if from a spring board       shall i be car ri ed toe the skies  on flow ry beds of ease       whilst others fight to win the prize  and sail thro  bloody seas     he was regarded as a wonderful reader  at church  sociables  he was  always called upon to read poetry  and when he was through  the ladies  would lift up their hands and let them fall helplessly in their laps   and  wall  their eyes  and shake their heads  as much as to say   words  cannot express it  it is too beautiful  too beautiful for this mortal  earth      after the hymn had been sung  the rev  mr  sprague turned himself into  a bulletin board  and read off  notices  of meetings and societies and  things till it seemed that the list would stretch out to the crack of  doom  a queer custom which is still kept up in america  even in cities   away here in this age of abundant newspapers  often  the less there is  to justify a traditional custom  the harder it is to get rid of it     and now the minister prayed  a good  generous prayer it was  and went  into details  it pleaded for the church  and the little children of the  church  for the other churches of the village  for the village itself   for the county  for the state  for the state officers  for the united  states  for the churches of the united states  for congress  for the  president  for the officers of the government  for poor sailors  tossed  by stormy seas  for the oppressed millions groaning under the heel of  european monarchies and oriental despotisms  for such as have the light  and the good tidings  and yet have not eyes to see nor ears to hear  withal  for the heathen in the far islands of the sea  and closed with  a supplication that the words he was about to speak might find grace  and favor  and be as seed sown in fertile ground  yielding in time a  grateful harvest of good  amen     there was a rustling of dresses  and the standing congregation sat  down  the boy whose history this book relates did not enjoy the prayer   he only endured it  if he even did that much  he was restive all  through it  he kept tally of the details of the prayer  unconsciously    for he was not listening  but he knew the ground of old  and the  clergyman s regular route over it  and when a little trifle of new  matter was interlarded  his ear detected it and his whole nature  resented it  he considered additions unfair  and scoundrelly  in the  midst of the prayer a fly had lit on the back of the pew in front of  him and tortured his spirit by calmly rubbing its hands together   embracing its head with its arms  and polishing it so vigorously that  it seemed to almost part company with the body  and the slender thread  of a neck was exposed to view  scraping its wings with its hind legs  and smoothing them to its body as if they had been coat tails  going  through its whole toilet as tranquilly as if it knew it was perfectly  safe  as indeed it was  for as sorely as tom s hands itched to grab for  it they did not dare  he believed his soul would be instantly destroyed  if he did such a thing while the prayer was going on  but with the  closing sentence his hand began to curve and steal forward  and the  instant the  amen  was out the fly was a prisoner of war  his aunt  detected the act and made him let it go     the minister gave out his text and droned along monotonously through  an argument that was so prosy that many a head by and by began to nod    and yet it was an argument that dealt in limitless fire and brimstone  and thinned the predestined elect down to a company so small as to be  hardly worth the saving  tom counted the pages of the sermon  after  church he always knew how many pages there had been  but he seldom knew  anything else about the discourse  however  this time he was really  interested for a little while  the minister made a grand and moving  picture of the assembling together of the world s hosts at the  millennium when the lion and the lamb should lie down together and a  little child should lead them  but the pathos  the lesson  the moral of  the great spectacle were lost upon the boy  he only thought of the  conspicuousness of the principal character before the on looking  nations  his face lit with the thought  and he said to himself that he  wished he could be that child  if it was a tame lion     now he lapsed into suffering again  as the dry argument was resumed   presently he bethought him of a treasure he had and got it out  it was  a large black beetle with formidable jaws  a  pinchbug   he called it   it was in a percussion cap box  the first thing the beetle did was to  take him by the finger  a natural fillip followed  the beetle went  floundering into the aisle and lit on its back  and the hurt finger  went into the boy s mouth  the beetle lay there working its helpless  legs  unable to turn over  tom eyed it  and longed for it  but it was  safe out of his reach  other people uninterested in the sermon found  relief in the beetle  and they eyed it too  presently a vagrant poodle  dog came idling along  sad at heart  lazy with the summer softness and  the quiet  weary of captivity  sighing for change  he spied the beetle   the drooping tail lifted and wagged  he surveyed the prize  walked  around it  smelt at it from a safe distance  walked around it again   grew bolder  and took a closer smell  then lifted his lip and made a  gingerly snatch at it  just missing it  made another  and another   began to enjoy the diversion  subsided to his stomach with the beetle  between his paws  and continued his experiments  grew weary at last   and then indifferent and absent minded  his head nodded  and little by  little his chin descended and touched the enemy  who seized it  there  was a sharp yelp  a flirt of the poodle s head  and the beetle fell a  couple of yards away  and lit on its back once more  the neighboring  spectators shook with a gentle inward joy  several faces went behind  fans and handkerchiefs  and tom was entirely happy  the dog looked  foolish  and probably felt so  but there was resentment in his heart   too  and a craving for revenge  so he went to the beetle and began a  wary attack on it again  jumping at it from every point of a circle   lighting with his fore paws within an inch of the creature  making even  closer snatches at it with his teeth  and jerking his head till his  ears flapped again  but he grew tired once more  after a while  tried  to amuse himself with a fly but found no relief  followed an ant  around  with his nose close to the floor  and quickly wearied of that   yawned  sighed  forgot the beetle entirely  and sat down on it  then  there was a wild yelp of agony and the poodle went sailing up the  aisle  the yelps continued  and so did the dog  he crossed the house in  front of the altar  he flew down the other aisle  he crossed before the  doors  he clamored up the home stretch  his anguish grew with his  progress  till presently he was but a woolly comet moving in its orbit  with the gleam and the speed of light  at last the frantic sufferer  sheered from its course  and sprang into its master s lap  he flung it  out of the window  and the voice of distress quickly thinned away and  died in the distance     by this time the whole church was red faced and suffocating with  suppressed laughter  and the sermon had come to a dead standstill  the  discourse was resumed presently  but it went lame and halting  all  possibility of impressiveness being at an end  for even the gravest  sentiments were constantly being received with a smothered burst of  unholy mirth  under cover of some remote pew back  as if the poor  parson had said a rarely facetious thing  it was a genuine relief to  the whole congregation when the ordeal was over and the benediction  pronounced     tom sawyer went home quite cheerful  thinking to himself that there  was some satisfaction about divine service when there was a bit of  variety in it  he had but one marring thought  he was willing that the  dog should play with his pinchbug  but he did not think it was upright  in him to carry it off         chapter vi    monday morning found tom sawyer miserable  monday morning always found  him so  because it began another week s slow suffering in school  he  generally began that day with wishing he had had no intervening  holiday  it made the going into captivity and fetters again so much  more odious     tom lay thinking  presently it occurred to him that he wished he was  sick  then he could stay home from school  here was a vague  possibility  he canvassed his system  no ailment was found  and he  investigated again  this time he thought he could detect colicky  symptoms  and he began to encourage them with considerable hope  but  they soon grew feeble  and presently died wholly away  he reflected  further  suddenly he discovered something  one of his upper front teeth  was loose  this was lucky  he was about to begin to groan  as a   starter   as he called it  when it occurred to him that if he came  into court with that argument  his aunt would pull it out  and that  would hurt  so he thought he would hold the tooth in reserve for the  present  and seek further  nothing offered for some little time  and  then he remembered hearing the doctor tell about a certain thing that  laid up a patient for two or three weeks and threatened to make him  lose a finger  so the boy eagerly drew his sore toe from under the  sheet and held it up for inspection  but now he did not know the  necessary symptoms  however  it seemed well worth while to chance it   so he fell to groaning with considerable spirit     but sid slept on unconscious     tom groaned louder  and fancied that he began to feel pain in the toe     no result from sid     tom was panting with his exertions by this time  he took a rest and  then swelled himself up and fetched a succession of admirable groans     sid snored on     tom was aggravated  he said   sid  sid   and shook him  this course  worked well  and tom began to groan again  sid yawned  stretched  then  brought himself up on his elbow with a snort  and began to stare at  tom  tom went on groaning  sid said      tom  say  tom    no response    here  tom  tom  what is the matter   tom   and he shook him and looked in his face anxiously     tom moaned out      oh  don t  sid  don t joggle me       why  what s the matter  tom  i must call auntie       no  never mind  it ll be over by and by  maybe  don t call anybody       but i must  don t groan so  tom  it s awful  how long you been this  way       hours  ouch  oh  don t stir so  sid  you ll kill me       tom  why didn t you wake me sooner  oh  tom  don t  it makes my  flesh crawl to hear you  tom  what is the matter       i forgive you everything  sid   groan   everything you ve ever done  to me  when i m gone        oh  tom  you ain t dying  are you  don t  tom  oh  don t  maybe        i forgive everybody  sid   groan   tell  em so  sid  and sid  you  give my window sash and my cat with one eye to that new girl that s  come to town  and tell her       but sid had snatched his clothes and gone  tom was suffering in  reality  now  so handsomely was his imagination working  and so his  groans had gathered quite a genuine tone     sid flew down stairs and said      oh  aunt polly  come  tom s dying       dying       yes m  don t wait  come quick       rubbage  i don t believe it      but she fled up stairs  nevertheless  with sid and mary at her heels   and her face grew white  too  and her lip trembled  when she reached  the bedside she gasped out      you  tom  tom  what s the matter with you       oh  auntie  i m        what s the matter with you  what is the matter with you  child       oh  auntie  my sore toe s mortified      the old lady sank down into a chair and laughed a little  then cried a  little  then did both together  this restored her and she said      tom  what a turn you did give me  now you shut up that nonsense and  climb out of this      the groans ceased and the pain vanished from the toe  the boy felt a  little foolish  and he said      aunt polly  it seemed mortified  and it hurt so i never minded my  tooth at all       your tooth  indeed  what s the matter with your tooth       one of them s loose  and it aches perfectly awful       there  there  now  don t begin that groaning again  open your mouth   well  your tooth is loose  but you re not going to die about that   mary  get me a silk thread  and a chunk of fire out of the kitchen      tom said      oh  please  auntie  don t pull it out  it don t hurt any more  i wish  i may never stir if it does  please don t  auntie  i don t want to stay  home from school       oh  you don t  don t you  so all this row was because you thought  you d get to stay home from school and go a fishing  tom  tom  i love  you so  and you seem to try every way you can to break my old heart  with your outrageousness   by this time the dental instruments were  ready  the old lady made one end of the silk thread fast to tom s tooth  with a loop and tied the other to the bedpost  then she seized the  chunk of fire and suddenly thrust it almost into the boy s face  the  tooth hung dangling by the bedpost  now     but all trials bring their compensations  as tom wended to school  after breakfast  he was the envy of every boy he met because the gap in  his upper row of teeth enabled him to expectorate in a new and  admirable way  he gathered quite a following of lads interested in the  exhibition  and one that had cut his finger and had been a centre of  fascination and homage up to this time  now found himself suddenly  without an adherent  and shorn of his glory  his heart was heavy  and  he said with a disdain which he did not feel that it wasn t anything to  spit like tom sawyer  but another boy said   sour grapes   and he  wandered away a dismantled hero     shortly tom came upon the juvenile pariah of the village  huckleberry  finn  son of the town drunkard  huckleberry was cordially hated and  dreaded by all the mothers of the town  because he was idle and lawless  and vulgar and bad  and because all their children admired him so  and  delighted in his forbidden society  and wished they dared to be like  him  tom was like the rest of the respectable boys  in that he envied  huckleberry his gaudy outcast condition  and was under strict orders  not to play with him  so he played with him every time he got a chance   huckleberry was always dressed in the cast off clothes of full grown  men  and they were in perennial bloom and fluttering with rags  his hat  was a vast ruin with a wide crescent lopped out of its brim  his coat   when he wore one  hung nearly to his heels and had the rearward buttons  far down the back  but one suspender supported his trousers  the seat  of the trousers bagged low and contained nothing  the fringed legs  dragged in the dirt when not rolled up     huckleberry came and went  at his own free will  he slept on doorsteps  in fine weather and in empty hogsheads in wet  he did not have to go to  school or to church  or call any being master or obey anybody  he could  go fishing or swimming when and where he chose  and stay as long as it  suited him  nobody forbade him to fight  he could sit up as late as he  pleased  he was always the first boy that went barefoot in the spring  and the last to resume leather in the fall  he never had to wash  nor  put on clean clothes  he could swear wonderfully  in a word  everything  that goes to make life precious that boy had  so thought every  harassed  hampered  respectable boy in st  petersburg     tom hailed the romantic outcast      hello  huckleberry       hello yourself  and see how you like it       what s that you got       dead cat       lemme see him  huck  my  he s pretty stiff  where d you get him        bought him off n a boy       what did you give       i give a blue ticket and a bladder that i got at the slaughter house       where d you get the blue ticket       bought it off n ben rogers two weeks ago for a hoop stick       say  what is dead cats good for  huck       good for  cure warts with       no  is that so  i know something that s better       i bet you don t  what is it       why  spunk water       spunk water  i wouldn t give a dern for spunk water       you wouldn t  wouldn t you  d you ever try it       no  i hain t  but bob tanner did       who told you so       why  he told jeff thatcher  and jeff told johnny baker  and johnny  told jim hollis  and jim told ben rogers  and ben told a nigger  and  the nigger told me  there now       well  what of it  they ll all lie  leastways all but the nigger  i  don t know him  but i never see a nigger that wouldn t lie  shucks  now  you tell me how bob tanner done it  huck       why  he took and dipped his hand in a rotten stump where the  rain water was       in the daytime       certainly       with his face to the stump       yes  least i reckon so       did he say anything       i don t reckon he did  i don t know       aha  talk about trying to cure warts with spunk water such a blame  fool way as that  why  that ain t a going to do any good  you got to go  all by yourself  to the middle of the woods  where you know there s a  spunk water stump  and just as it s midnight you back up against the  stump and jam your hand in and say        barley corn  barley corn  injun meal shorts      spunk water  spunk water  swaller these warts      and then walk away quick  eleven steps  with your eyes shut  and then  turn around three times and walk home without speaking to anybody   because if you speak the charm s busted       well  that sounds like a good way  but that ain t the way bob tanner  done       no  sir  you can bet he didn t  becuz he s the wartiest boy in this  town  and he wouldn t have a wart on him if he d knowed how to work  spunk water  i ve took off thousands of warts off of my hands that way   huck  i play with frogs so much that i ve always got considerable many  warts  sometimes i take  em off with a bean       yes  bean s good  i ve done that       have you  what s your way       you take and split the bean  and cut the wart so as to get some  blood  and then you put the blood on one piece of the bean and take and  dig a hole and bury it  bout midnight at the crossroads in the dark of  the moon  and then you burn up the rest of the bean  you see that piece  that s got the blood on it will keep drawing and drawing  trying to  fetch the other piece to it  and so that helps the blood to draw the  wart  and pretty soon off she comes       yes  that s it  huck  that s it  though when you re burying it if you  say  down bean  off wart  come no more to bother me   it s better   that s the way joe harper does  and he s been nearly to coonville and  most everywheres  but say  how do you cure  em with dead cats       why  you take your cat and go and get in the graveyard  long about  midnight when somebody that was wicked has been buried  and when it s  midnight a devil will come  or maybe two or three  but you can t see   em  you can only hear something like the wind  or maybe hear  em talk   and when they re taking that feller away  you heave your cat after  em  and say   devil follow corpse  cat follow devil  warts follow cat  i m  done with ye   that ll fetch any wart       sounds right  d you ever try it  huck       no  but old mother

first one i ve seen this year       say  huck  i ll give you my tooth for him       less see it      tom got out a bit of paper and carefully unrolled it  huckleberry  viewed it wistfully  the temptation was very strong  at last he said      is it genuwyne      tom lifted his lip and showed the vacancy      well  all right   said huckleberry   it s a trade      tom enclosed the tick in the percussion cap box that had lately been  the pinchbug s prison  and the boys separated  each feeling wealthier  than before     when tom reached the little isolated frame schoolhouse  he strode in  briskly  with the manner of one who had come with all honest speed   he hung his hat on a peg and flung himself into his seat with  business like alacrity  the master  throned on high in his great  splint bottom arm chair  was dozing  lulled by the drowsy hum of study   the interruption roused him      thomas sawyer      tom knew that when his name was pronounced in full  it meant trouble      sir       come up here  now  sir  why are you late again  as usual      tom was about to take refuge in a lie  when he saw two long tails of  yellow hair hanging down a back that he recognized by the electric  sympathy of love  and by that form was the only vacant place on the  girls  side of the schoolhouse  he instantly said      i stopped to talk with huckleberry finn      the master s pulse stood still  and he stared helplessly  the buzz of  study ceased  the pupils wondered if this foolhardy boy had lost his  mind  the master said      you  you did what       stopped to talk with huckleberry finn      there was no mistaking the words      thomas sawyer  this is the most astounding confession i have ever  listened to  no mere ferule will answer for this offence  take off your  jacket      the master s arm performed until it was tired and the stock of  switches notably diminished  then the order followed      now  sir  go and sit with the girls  and let this be a warning to you      the titter that rippled around the room appeared to abash the boy  but  in reality that result was caused rather more by his worshipful awe of  his unknown idol and the dread pleasure that lay in his high good  fortune  he sat down upon the end of the pine bench and the girl  hitched herself away from him with a toss of her head  nudges and winks  and whispers traversed the room  but tom sat still  with his arms upon  the long  low desk before him  and seemed to study his book     by and by attention ceased from him  and the accustomed school murmur  rose upon the dull air once more  presently the boy began to steal  furtive glances at the girl  she observed it   made a mouth  at him and  gave him the back of her head for the space of a minute  when she  cautiously faced around again  a peach lay before her  she thrust it  away  tom gently put it back  she thrust it away again  but with less  animosity  tom patiently returned it to its place  then she let it  remain  tom scrawled on his slate   please take it  i got more   the  girl glanced at the words  but made no sign  now the boy began to draw  something on the slate  hiding his work with his left hand  for a time  the girl refused to notice  but her human curiosity presently began to  manifest itself by hardly perceptible signs  the boy worked on   apparently unconscious  the girl made a sort of noncommittal attempt to  see  but the boy did not betray that he was aware of it  at last she  gave in and hesitatingly whispered      let me see it      tom partly uncovered a dismal caricature of a house with two gable  ends to it and a corkscrew of smoke issuing from the chimney  then the  girl s interest began to fasten itself upon the work and she forgot  everything else  when it was finished  she gazed a moment  then  whispered      it s nice  make a man      the artist erected a man in the front yard  that resembled a derrick   he could have stepped over the house  but the girl was not  hypercritical  she was satisfied with the monster  and whispered      it s a beautiful man  now make me coming along      tom drew an hour glass with a full moon and straw limbs to it and  armed the spreading fingers with a portentous fan  the girl said      it s ever so nice  i wish i could draw       it s easy   whispered tom   i ll learn you       oh  will you  when       at noon  do you go home to dinner       i ll stay if you will       good  that s a whack  what s your name       becky thatcher  what s yours  oh  i know  it s thomas sawyer       that s the name they lick me by  i m tom when i m good  you call me  tom  will you       yes      now tom began to scrawl something on the slate  hiding the words from  the girl  but she was not backward this time  she begged to see  tom  said      oh  it ain t anything       yes it is       no it ain t  you don t want to see       yes i do  indeed i do  please let me       you ll tell       no i won t  deed and deed and double deed won t       you won t tell anybody at all  ever  as long as you live       no  i won t ever tell anybody  now let me       oh  you don t want to see       now that you treat me so  i will see   and she put her small hand  upon his and a little scuffle ensued  tom pretending to resist in  earnest but letting his hand slip by degrees till these words were  revealed   i love you       oh  you bad thing   and she hit his hand a smart rap  but reddened  and looked pleased  nevertheless     just at this juncture the boy felt a slow  fateful grip closing on his  ear  and a steady lifting impulse  in that vise he was borne across the  house and deposited in his own seat  under a peppering fire of giggles  from the whole school  then the master stood over him during a few  awful moments  and finally moved away to his throne without saying a  word  but although tom s ear tingled  his heart was jubilant     as the school quieted down tom made an honest effort to study  but the  turmoil within him was too great  in turn he took his place in the  reading class and made a botch of it  then in the geography class and  turned lakes into mountains  mountains into rivers  and rivers into  continents  till chaos was come again  then in the spelling class  and  got  turned down   by a succession of mere baby words  till he brought  up at the foot and yielded up the pewter medal which he had worn with  ostentation for months         chapter vii    the harder tom tried to fasten his mind on his book  the more his  ideas wandered  so at last  with a sigh and a yawn  he gave it up  it  seemed to him that the noon recess would never come  the air was  utterly dead  there was not a breath stirring  it was the sleepiest of  sleepy days  the drowsing murmur of the five and twenty studying  scholars soothed the soul like the spell that is in the murmur of bees   away off in the flaming sunshine  cardiff hill lifted its soft green  sides through a shimmering veil of heat  tinted with the purple of  distance  a few birds floated on lazy wing high in the air  no other  living thing was visible but some cows  and they were asleep  tom s  heart ached to be free  or else to have something of interest to do to  pass the dreary time  his hand wandered into his pocket and his face  lit up with a glow of gratitude that was prayer  though he did not know  it  then furtively the percussion cap box came out  he released the  tick and put him on the long flat desk  the creature probably glowed  with a gratitude that amounted to prayer  too  at this moment  but it  was premature  for when he started thankfully to travel off  tom turned  him aside with a pin and made him take a new direction     tom s bosom friend sat next him  suffering just as tom had been  and  now he was deeply and gratefully interested in this entertainment in an  instant  this bosom friend was joe harper  the two boys were sworn  friends all the week  and embattled enemies on saturdays  joe took a  pin out of his lapel and began to assist in exercising the prisoner   the sport grew in interest momently  soon tom said that they were  interfering with each other  and neither getting the fullest benefit of  the tick  so he put joe s slate on the desk and drew a line down the  middle of it from top to bottom      now   said he   as long as he is on your side you can stir him up and  i ll let him alone  but if you let him get away and get on my side   you re to leave him alone as long as i can keep him from crossing over       all right  go ahead  start him up      the tick escaped from tom  presently  and crossed the equator  joe  harassed him awhile  and then he got away and crossed back again  this  change of base occurred often  while one boy was worrying the tick with  absorbing interest  the other would look on with interest as strong   the two heads bowed together over the slate  and the two souls dead to  all things else  at last luck seemed to settle and abide with joe  the  tick tried this  that  and the other course  and got as excited and as  anxious as the boys themselves  but time and again just as he would  have victory in his very grasp  so to speak  and tom s fingers would be  twitching to begin  joe s pin would deftly head him off  and keep  possession  at last tom could stand it no longer  the temptation was  too strong  so he reached out and lent a hand with his pin  joe was  angry in a moment  said he      tom  you let him alone       i only just want to stir him up a little  joe       no  sir  it ain t fair  you just let him alone       blame it  i ain t going to stir him much       let him alone  i tell you       i won t       you shall  he s on my side of the line       look here  joe harper  whose is that tick       i don t care whose tick he is  he s on my side of the line  and you  sha n t touch him       well  i ll just bet i will  though  he s my tick and i ll do what i  blame please with him  or die      a tremendous whack came down on tom s shoulders  and its duplicate on  joe s  and for the space of two minutes the dust continued to fly from  the two jackets and the whole school to enjoy it  the boys had been too  absorbed to notice the hush that had stolen upon the school awhile  before when the master came tiptoeing down the room and stood over  them  he had contemplated a good part of the performance before he  contributed his bit of variety to it     when school broke up at noon  tom flew to becky thatcher  and  whispered in her ear      put on your bonnet and let on you re going home  and when you get to  the corner  give the rest of  em the slip  and turn down through the  lane and come back  i ll go the other way and come it over  em the same  way      so the one went off with one group of scholars  and the other with  another  in a little while the two met at the bottom of the lane  and  when they reached the school they had it all to themselves  then they  sat together  with a slate before them  and tom gave becky the pencil  and held her hand in his  guiding it  and so created another surprising  house  when the interest in art began to wane  the two fell to talking   tom was swimming in bliss  he said      do you love rats       no  i hate them       well  i do  too  live ones  but i mean dead ones  to swing round your  head with a string       no  i don t care for rats much  anyway  what i like is chewing gum       oh  i should say so  i wish i had some now       do you  i ve got some  i ll let you chew it awhile  but you must give  it back to me      that was agreeable  so they chewed it turn about  and dangled their  legs against the bench in excess of contentment      was you ever at a circus   said tom      yes  and my pa s going to take me again some time  if i m good       i been to the circus three or four times  lots of times  church ain t  shucks to a circus  there s things going on at a circus all the time   i m going to be a clown in a circus when i grow up       oh  are you  that will be nice  they re so lovely  all spotted up       yes  that s so  and they get slathers of money  most a dollar a day   ben rogers says  say  becky  was you ever engaged       what s that       why  engaged to be married       no       would you like to       i reckon so  i don t know  what is it like       like  why it ain t like anything  you only just tell a boy you won t  ever have anybody but him  ever ever ever  and then you kiss and that s  all  anybody can do it       kiss  what do you kiss for       why  that  you know  is to  well  they always do that       everybody       why  yes  everybody that s in love with each other  do you remember  what i wrote on the slate       ye  yes       what was it       i sha n t tell you       shall i tell you       ye  yes  but some other time       no  now       no  not now  to morrow       oh  no  now  please  becky  i ll whisper it  i ll whisper it ever so  easy      becky hesitating  tom took silence for consent  and passed his arm  about her waist and whispered the tale ever so softly  with his mouth  close to her ear  and then he added      now you whisper it to me  just the same      she resisted  for a while  and then said      you turn your face away so you can t see  and then i will  but you  mustn t ever tell anybody  will you  tom  now you won t  will you       no  indeed  indeed i won t  now  becky      he turned his face away  she bent timidly around till her breath  stirred his curls and whispered   i  love  you      then she sprang away and ran around and around the desks and benches   with tom after her  and took refuge in a corner at last  with her  little white apron to her face  tom clasped her about her neck and  pleaded      now  becky  it s all done  all over but the kiss  don t you be afraid  of that  it ain t anything at all  please  becky   and he tugged at her  apron and the hands     by and by she gave up  and let her hands drop  her face  all glowing  with the struggle  came up and submitted  tom kissed the red lips and  said      now it s all done  becky  and always after this  you know  you ain t  ever to love anybody but me  and you ain t ever to marry anybody but  me  ever never and forever  will you       no  i ll never love anybody but you  tom  and i ll never marry  anybody but you  and you ain t to ever marry anybody but me  either       certainly  of course  that s part of it  and always coming to school  or when we re going home  you re to walk with me  when there ain t  anybody looking  and you choose me and i choose you at parties  because  that s the way you do when you re engaged       it s so nice  i never heard of it before       oh  it s ever so gay  why  me and amy lawrence       the big eyes told tom his blunder and he stopped  confused      oh  tom  then i ain t the first you ve ever been engaged to      the child began to cry  tom said      oh  don t cry  becky  i don t care for her any more       yes  you do  tom  you know you do      tom tried to put his arm about her neck  but she pushed him away and  turned her face to the wall  and went on crying  tom tried again  with  soothing words in his mouth  and was repulsed again  then his pride was  up  and he strode away and went outside  he stood about  restless and  uneasy  for a while  glancing at the door  every now and then  hoping  she would repent and come to find him  but she did not  then he began  to feel badly and fear that he was in the wrong  it was a hard struggle  with him to make new advances  now  but he nerved himself to it and  entered  she was still standing back there in the corner  sobbing  with  her face to the wall  tom s heart smote him  he went to her and stood a  moment  not knowing exactly how to proceed  then he said hesitatingly      becky  i  i don t care for anybody but you      no reply  but sobs      becky   pleadingly   becky  won t you say something      more sobs     tom got out his chiefest jewel  a brass knob from the top of an  andiron  and passed it around her so that she could see it  and said      please  becky  won t you take it      she struck it to the floor  then tom marched out of the house and over  the hills and far away  to return to school no more that day  presently  becky began to suspect  she ran to the door  he was not in sight  she  flew around to the play yard  he was not there  then she called      tom  come back  tom      she listened intently  but there was no answer  she had no companions  but silence and loneliness  so she sat down to cry again and upbraid  herself  and by this time the scholars began to gather again  and she  had to hide her griefs and still her broken heart and take up the cross  of a long  dreary  aching afternoon  with none among the strangers  about her to exchange sorrows with             wager he s a rhodes scholar          kathleen   i put her at seventeen  and  as whitney says  she s a  darling  she s at school still  she s adorably sane  she doesn t care  for joe s yowling poetry  probably he writes verlaine kind of stuff   or free verse  or some blither of that sort   she has younger brothers    the boys   and she helps her mother run the house  i think she likes  joe better than she cares to admit  see the touch of coquettishness  where she says  it  will  be precious  won t it   and how adorably she  teases him in those four crosses marked  these are from fred   gad  i m  jealous of joe already          fred   i think he s the older brother  probably recently left the   varsity  a friend of joe s  perhaps          charlie  is one of the younger brothers  he goes to some kind of  night school or gymnasium  probably an ugly little beggar  why doesn t  he get his food for himself          the mother   don t know anything about her except that she went to  birmingham with kathleen          the father   has lumbago       one thing you don t mention   said graham   it s an easy run from here  to wolverhampton on a motor bike       rather a sell if joe should turn out a boxing blue  and mash us all  into pulp for bagging his letter   said whitney  there was a general  laugh at this  whitney was over six feet  rowed number   in the balliol  boat  and was nicknamed the iron duke for his muscular strength      go on with your chapter  priapus   said the goblin           ii      when forbes had finished there was general laughter and applause  the  whimsical idea of building a tale around the persons of the letter was  one which his playful mind was competent to develop  and he had written  a deft and amusing introduction  taking  joe  as his subject he had  sketched that gentleman s character with a touch of irony  he had made  him a rhodes scholar from indiana  evoking good natured protest from  minters  and had carried him on a vacation to guilford house  a small  hotel in london much frequented by rhodes scholars  there he had made  him meet kathleen who  with her mother  was staying in london for a few  days  forbes had a taste for brunettes  and in his description of the  imagined kathleen he had indulged himself heartily  he found her to be  seventeen  slender  with that strong slimness that only an english girl  achieves  with a straight brown gaze and abundant dark chestnut hair   she was captain of her school hockey team  it seemed  she was good at  tennis and swimming and geometry  she had small patience with poetry and  sentiment  but within the athletic and straightforward flapper forbes  thought he saw the fluttering of deeper womanhood  the maiden soul  erecting a barrier of abrupt common sense about itself to conceal the  shy and sensitive feelings that were beginning to blossom  such at any  rate was kenneth forbes s psycho analysis  and he developed his chapter  toward a climax where kathleen and joe were left walking in regent s  park  and the next author would find some difficulty in knowing how to  proceed with the second instalment      well done indeed   cried blair  as forbes laid down his manuscript and  reached for his pipe  there was a general murmur of assent as the men  got up to stretch and talk  someone punched the coals into flame  and  the bowl of fruit was passed round      who s to write the next chapter   asked graham      let falstaff do it   cried blair   he s the sentimentalist  but go easy  on poor joe  you know all rhodes scholars don t come from indiana  have  a heart       do whatever you like to joe   cried forbes   but be careful with  kathleen  she s adorable  i m going to write a ballade to her and mail  it to her anonymously       i wish there was some way of getting hold of her picture   said keith      her picture   said graham   nonsense  why not see the flapper herself   i m going to bike over there on my rudge  erb round till i find the  street  and then skid like hell right on to her doorstep  i shall lie  there in mute agony until i m carried indoors       i say  now  that s no fair   cried forbes   i discovered her  just  because you ve got a motor bike you mustn t take an advantage       look here   said the goblin  mildly  speaking from a blue cloud of  murray s mixture   we must all sign a protocol  or a mandamus or a  lagniappe or whatever you law men call it  not to steal a march  i think  we d all like to meet the real kathleen  but we must give a bond to  start fair and square  and nobody do anything that isn t authorized by  the whole club       right o   cried several voices      all right  then   said the goblin   fill glasses everyone  and we ll  solemnize the oath  brother scorpions  i do you to wit that we all   jointly and severally  promise not to take any steps toward making the  acquaintance of said kathleen until so authorized by the whole society   so help me god      they all drank to this  with some chuckles      what a lark if we could get kathleen down for eights week   said  someone      very likely joe will have her here   said whitney   you seem to forget  that he s been rowing this course for some time      they all scowled      i wonder how many members of the  varsity are called joe   keith asked      about three hundred  i dare say   said falstaff      i tell you what we might do   said forbes   when the yarn s finished we  can send it to her  explain just how the whole thing happened  and ask  permission to call  she s got a sense of humour  i ll swear       balmy   retorted falstaff   she d probably be frightfully fed because  you bagged her letter   s a hell of a thing to do  crib a lady s  letter       it s a hell of a thing to do to leave it lying around   cried forbes   impenitent   no quarter for joebags  let the punishment fit the crime       well  you chaps  i ve got to sheer off   said whitney   it s nearly  eleven and i ve got an essay on the stocks  cheer o priapus  i ve had a  ripping time        arf a mo    cried forbes   who s to do the next chapter  and where do  we meet next week       falstaff   cried several voices      why not do two chapters a week   said carter   i ll do one  and goblin  can do another  let s meet in my rooms      this was agreed to  and after much scuffling with greatcoats and scarves  the guests tramped off down the stairs and out into the rainy quad   forbes could hear them  a minute later  thundering with their heels on  the huge iron studded college gate as they waited for the porter to let  them out  the room was foul with smoke  and he opened a window over  the gardens letting in a gush of chill sweet air and rain  through the  darkness he could hear many chimes  counting eleven  he looked wearily  at the scribbled notes for his essay on danton and robespierre  then  shrugged his shoulders and went to bed           iii      by the time that carter and king had written their chapters and read  them aloud  the scorpions were all frankly adorers of kathleen  by  midterm she had become an obsession  eric twiston and bob graham   doing  a cornstalk   as walking on cornmarket street is elegantly termed  were  wont to dub any really delightful girl they saw as  a kathleen sort of  person   at the annual dinner of the club  which took place in a private  dining room at the  clarry   the clarendon hotel  in february  forbes  was called upon to respond to the toast  the real kathleen   his voice   tremulous with emotion and absinthe frappe  nearly failed him  but  he managed to stammer a few phrases which  thought at the time to be  extemporaneous  called forth loud applause  but it was found later  that he had jotted them down on the tablecloth during the soup and fish  courses   fellow scorpers   he said   i mean you chaps  look here  i m  not much at this dispatch box business  but  hem  i want to say that i  regard kathleen with feelings of iridescent emotion  i feel sure that  she is a pronounced brunette and that the blue flapper we all used to  see at the east ocker is nowhere  i ve been playing lackers  lacrosse   this term and i give you my word that when i ve been bloody well done  in and had an absolute needle of funk i had only to think of kathleen to  buck me up  hem  now gentlemen  you may think i m drunk  loud cries of   no    but i want to say in truth and soberness that any man who thinks  he s got kathleen for bondwoman  hem  has me to reckon with      the applause at this speech was so immoderate that a party of boston  ladies dining with a chautauqua lecturer in the clarendon s main dining  room  shuddered and began looking up time tables to stratford     by this time the serial story had grown to the length of seven or eight  chapters  and the scorpions became so engrossed in the fortunes of the  kenyons  so  for convenience  they had dubbed kathleen s family  that at  the dinner a separate health was drunk to each character in the story   and one of the members was called upon to reply  falstaff carter  responded to the toast to  joe   and recounted his secret investigations  into the number of members of the university who bore that name   he claimed to have tabulated from the university almanac     men so  christened  and offered to go into the life history of any or all of  them  he said that he was happy to say that the only joseph who seemed  at all likely to be a poet was a scrubby little man at teddy hall  who  wore spectacles and a ragged exhibitioner s gown and did not seem to  threaten a serious rivalry to any scorpion bent on supplanting him   i  also find   he added   that the master of the new college and magdalen  beagles is called joe  he is a member of the bullingdon  and if he is  the cheese it s distinctly mooters whether any of the scorpers have a  ghostly show  but i vote  gentlemen  that we don t crock at this stage  of the game      it was decided at the dinner that during the ensuing easter vacation the  scorpions should make a trip to wolverhampton  en masse  for the purpose  of picketing bancroft road and finding out what kathleen was really  like  and then  after singing  langers and godders   auld lang syne and  god save the king  the meeting broke up and the members dispersed darkly  in various directions to avoid the proctors           iv      friday the fifteenth of march was the last day of term  the scorpions   busy in their various ways with the hundred details that have to be  attended to before  going down   were all pleasantly excited by the  anticipation of their quest  which was to begin on the morrow  carter   shaking hands with the warden of new college in the college hall   a pleasant little formality performed at the end of each term   absent mindedly replied  wolverhampton  when the warden asked him where  he was going to spend the vacation  he was then hard put to it to avoid  a letter of introduction to the vicar of st  philip s in that city  an  old pupil of the warden  king  bicycling rapidly down the greasy turl  with an armful of books  collided vigorously with another cyclist at the  corner of the high  they both sprawled on the curb  bikes interlocked    my god  sir   cried the goblin   why not watch where you re going    then he saw it was johnny blair   sorry  goblin   said the latter   i  i  was thinking about kathleen    so was i   said king  picking up  his books  and in defiance of the university statute of       still  unrepealed  which warns students against  frequenting dicing houses   taverns  or booths where the nicotian herb is sold   they went into  hedderly s together to buy tobacco     after breakfast the next morning they were all in cabs on their way to  the great western station  it was a mild and sunny day  with puffs of  spring in the air  who can ever forget the saturday morning at the end  of term when the men  go down   long lines of hansoms spinning briskly  toward the station  with bulging portmanteaus on the roof  the wide  sunny sweep of the broad with the  bus trundling past trinity gates   a knot of tall youths in the  varsity uniform of gray  bags  and brown  tweed norfolk  smoking and talking at the balliol lodge  and over it all  the clang of a hundred chimes  the gray fingers of a thousand spires  and pinnacles  the moist blue sky of england     ah  it is the palace of  youth  or it was once     the scorpions met on the dingy north bound platform  graham  keith   and twiston had been obliged to scratch owing to other more imperative  plans  but five members boarded the    o clock train in high spirits   forbes  carter  king  blair  and whitney  they filled a third class  smoker with tobacco and jest      now  goblin   cried falstaff  as the train ran past the port meadow   and the radcliffe dome dropped from view   open those sealed orders  you  promised to draw up the rules of the game      king pulled a paper from his pocket      i jotted down some points   he said   this is the time to discuss  them        rules to be observed by the scorpions on the great kathleen excursion         the headquarters of the expedition will be the blue boar inn at  wolverhampton   i ve written to them to engage rooms          the kriegspiel will begin to day at   p m   and manoeuvres will  continue without intermission until someone is declared the winner  or  until time is called         the object of the contest is to make the acquaintance of kathleen   to engage her in friendly conversation  to win her confidence  and to  induce her to accept an invitation to commem  or eights week         any deception  strategy  or tactics which are not calculated to give  intolerable distress or embarrassment to kathleen and her family  are  allowable         if by noon on tuesday no one shall have succeeded in making friends  with kathleen  the game shall be declared off       suppose she s not at home   said whitney      we ll have to chance that       what time do we get there       i ve ordered lunch at the blue boar at one o clock  this train gets to  wolvers at            it was a merry ride  the story of kathleen as they had written it was  discussed pro and con   the usual protests were launched at carter  for having in his chapter lowered the theme to the level of burlesque   praise was accorded to the goblin for the dexterity with which he had  rescued the plot  blair s chapter had been full of american slang which  had to be explained to the others   joe   the rhodes scholar hero  had  shown a vein of fine gold under blair s hands  he bade fair to win the  charming kathleen  although the story had not been finished owing to  the examinations which had fallen upon the brotherhood toward the end of  term  the game  begun in pure jest  had taken on something of romantic  earnest  there was not one of these young men who did not see in  kathleen his own ideal of slender  bright cheeked girlhood  and when  the train pulled into wolverhampton  they tumbled out of their smoking  carriage with keen expectation           v      perhaps the best way to pursue the next episodes in the quest is in the  words of johnny blair  the rhodes scholar  who jotted down some notes in  a journal he kept     we got to wolverhampton        ingersoll time  had a jolly trip on  the train  all the scorps laying bets as to who would be first to meet  kathleen  i lay low  but did some planning  didn t want to let these  english blighters get ahead of me  especially after all the ragging  indiana joe got in the story     train stopped at birmingham at noon  my tobacco pouch had run empty  and  i hopped out to buy some murray s at the newsstand  saw the prettiest  flapper of my life on the platform  the real english type  tweed suit   dark hair  gray eyes  and cheeks like almond blossoms  she had on a  blue tam o  shanter  loveliest figure i ever saw  perfect ankle  but  the usual heavy brogues on her feet  why do english girls always wear  woollen stockings  was so taken with her i almost missed the train  she  got into a third class compartment farther up the train  the others were  all bickering in the smoking carriage  so they didn t see her     i scored over the rest of the crowd when we got to wolvers  they had all  brought heavy portmanteaus  containing all their vacation baggage  my  idea was  go light when chasing the grail  had only my rucksack  left  rest of my stuff at coll   to be forwarded later  while the other chaps  were getting their stuff out of the goods van i spotted miss flapper  getting off the train  she got into a hansom  just by dumb luck i was  standing near  i heard her say to cabby        bancroft road   lord  was  i tickled  i kept mum     most of the fellows took cabs  on account of their luggage  but goblin  and i hoofed it  wolverhampton seems a dingy place for kathleen to live   fine old church  though  and lovely market place  we kept our eyes open  for bancroft road  but saw no sign     when we got to the blue boar  lunch was all ready for us in the coffee  room  landlord tickled to death at our arrival  wonderful cheddar  cheese  and archdeacon ale  we made quite a ceremony of it  all drank  kathleen s health  and on the stroke of two we got up from the table     all the others beat it off immediately in different directions  looking  for bancroft road  i expect  i had an idea that more finesse would be  needed  i started off with the others  then pretended i had left  my pipe  and came back to the boar  i was going to look up the town  directory  to find kathleen s name  knowing the address  that would be  easy  but there was goblin doing the same thing  we both laughed and  looked it up together  the name at      bancroft road was kent  philip  kent  f s a   fellow of the society of antiquaries  i suppose  the book  put him down as an  antiquarian   kathleen s father  evidently     goblin disappeared in that noiseless way of his  and i lit a pipe and  pondered     the fellows had been full of wild suggestions as to what they would do  when they got to      bancroft road  one was going to be a book agent  and get into the house that way  another said he would be the grocer s  man and make friends with the cook  someone else suggested dressing up  as a plumber or gas man  and going there to fix some imaginary leak   knowing that the kents were not fools  i imagined it wouldn t be long  before they d get wise to the fact that that bunch of dreadnoughts  was picketing the house  probably they d put the police on them  also   there s nobody harder to disguise than an english  varsity man  he gives  himself away at every turn  if  fred  was around he d be sure to smell a  rat  one of those chaps would be likely to fake himself up as a plumber   and get in the house on some pretext or other  still wearing his  wrist watch     i thought it wouldn t be a bad idea to stay away from bancroft road for  a while and try to pull wires from a distance     the blue boar inn  a very nice old house  by the way  looks out over  the old wolverhampton market place  in one corner of the square i had  noticed a little post office  you can send a telegram from any post  office in england  and i thought that would be my best entering wedge   the word  antiquarian  in the directory had given me a notion  on a  blank i composed the following message  after some revisions       miss kathleen kent          bancroft road     wolverhampton     my friend john blair of trinity now in wolverhampton for historical  study staying at blue boar nice chap american may he call on you if so  send him a line sorry can t write hurt hand playing soccer love to all     joe       this was taking a long chance  but was the best move i could think of  i  asked the lady behind the counter to mark the telegram as though it  came from oxford  she said she could not do so  but i happened to have a  five bob piece in my pocket and that persuaded her  i convinced her that  it was a harmless joke     i didn t see that there was anything further to be done immediately  if  the telegram brought no word i should have to think up something else   in the meantime  if i was to pose as an antiquarian investigator i had  better get up some dope on the history of wolverhampton  i poked about  until i found a bookshop  where i bought a little pamphlet about the  town  and studied a map  bancroft road was out toward the northern  suburbs  a little talk with the bookseller brought me the information  that mr  kent was one of his best customers  a pleasant and  simple minded gentleman of sixty whose only hobby was the history of the  region  he had written a book called  memorials of old staffordshire    but unfortunately i couldn t get a copy  the bookseller said it was out  of print     then i went to have a look at st  philip s church  a fine old norman  pile with some lovely brasses and crusaders  tombs  here i had a piece  of luck  fell in with the vicar  one of the jolly old port wine and  knicker bocker sort  an old oxford man  as it happened  i pumped him a  little about the history of the church  and in his delight at finding an  american who cared for such matters he talked freely   why   he kept on  saying  with a kind of pathetic enthusiasm   i thought all you americans  were interested in was standard oil and tinned beef   finally he invited  me over to the vicarage for tea  as i sat by his fire and ate toasted  muffins i couldn t help chuckling to think how different this was from  the other scorpions  plan of attack  they were probably all biting  their nails up and down bancroft road trying to carry the fort by direct  assault  it s amazing how things turn out  just as i was wondering how  to give the conversation a twist in the right direction  the vicar said      if you re really interested in the history of this region you should  certainly have a talk with old mr  kent  he s our leading antiquarian   and knows more about the stour valley than any one else  he says there  was a skirmish fought here in      that all the books have overlooked   the battle of wolverhampton  he calls it  he wrote a little pamphlet  about it once      i assured the good parson that my eagerness to know more about the  battle of wolverhampton was unbounded  i nearly spilled my tea in my  excitement      is that mr  kent of      bancroft road   i asked      yes   answered the vicar   how did you know       they told me about him at the bookshop      i explained that i was in wolverhampton for a day or so only  and  finally the excellent man came across with the suggestion i was panting  for      well   he said   as it happens  i have one or two calls to make in that  direction this evening  if you care to have me do so  i ll speak to  mr  kent about you  and he can make an appointment  you said you were  stopping at the blue boar      i thanked him with such warmth that his eyes twinkled      my dear fellow   he said   your enthusiasm does you great credit  i  wish you all success in your thesis      i got back to the boar feeling that i had done a very good afternoon s  work indeed           vi      the scorpions  continues blair s diary  were all very merry at dinner  that night  particularly at my expense  i was the only one who had not  been out to bancroft road to look over the ground  apparently they had  had a very cheery time      well  falstaff  what luck   i asked carter      splendid   he replied   the local butcher has given me a job and i m  going to call there for a meat order tomorrow morning       what   shouted someone   on sunday  not likely      i knew mighty well that carter would not concoct anything as crude as  that  and wondered what deviltry he had devised      i noticed that two telegrams were delivered at the house this  afternoon   said forbes  in a quiet  non committal kind of way      perhaps joe is on his way here   said i   if so  good night   as i  spoke  i wondered rather anxiously what the  other  telegram could be      well  we saw her  anyway   said whitney   and she s marvellous  she  wears a blue tam o  shanter and has an ankle like a fairy tale  we saw  her walk down the street       that s nothing   i retorted   i saw her hours ago  she was on the train  with us from birmingham this morning      this started a furious wrangle  they said i hadn t played fair  as the  contest didn t begin until two o clock  my point was that i had not  transgressed the rules as i had done nothing to profit by my accident in  seeing her first      i couldn t help seeing her  could i   i asked   you could have  too   if you hadn t been all frowsting over  tit bits  in the train  and after  all  i didn t  know  it was kathleen  i only suspected it      i changed the conversation by asking where the goblin was     no one had noticed before that he hadn t turned up  this was a bit  disconcerting  i secretly thought him the most dangerous competitor   he has a quiet  impish twinkle in his eye  and an unobtrusive way of  getting what he wants  however  the others scoffed at my fears     although they all talked a great deal about the amusing time they had  had  i could not gather that they had really accomplished much  forbes  claimed to have seen fred  and said he looked like a rotter  we drank  kathleen s health a couple of times  and then the other three sat down  to dummy bridge  i slipped away to the public library  partly to get  some more of my antiquarian information about wolverhampton  and partly  because i knew my absence would disquiet them     i found the library after some difficulty  in the large reading room i  hunted up some books of reference  but to my disappointment mr  kent s  volume was out  looking round for a place to sit  the first person i saw  was the goblin  bent very busily over a book and making notes on a pad  of paper  i leaned over him      hello  goblin   i whispered   getting ready for a first      he started  and tried to cover his volume with a newspaper  but i had  seen it  it was a cook book      that s a queer kind of fiction you re mulling over   i remarked      i m looking up a recipe for stuffed eggs   said the goblin  without a  quiver   our common room steward does them so poorly       well  don t let me interrupt you   i said  i sat down in a corner of  the room with a volume of the britannica  when i next looked up the  goblin was gone     as usual  i wasted my time with the encyclopedia  i got interested in  the articles on wages  warts  weather  wordsworth  and worms  by the  time i got to wolverhampton it was closing time  i did just seize the  information that the town was founded in     by wulfruna  widow of the  earl of northampton  then i had to leave     i got back to the boar about ten thirty  the coffee room was empty  the  landlord said that whitney and forbes were out  but that mr  carter had  gone upstairs     falstaff and i were rooming together  and when i went up i found him  reading in bed      hello  wulfruna   he said  as i came in     evidently he  too  had been reading up some history  just as i got into  bed he fell asleep and his book dropped to the floor with a thump  i  crept quietly across the room and picked it up  it was  memorials of old  staffordshire   by philip kent  f s a   the very copy that i had looked  for at the library  i skimmed over it and then put it carefully back  by falstaff s bedside  was he on the antiquarian trail  too  i began to  realize that these rivals of mine would take some beating     the next morning  sunday  i found a note waiting for me on the breakfast  table  three indignant scorpions were weighing it  studying the  handwriting  and examining the stationery like three broken hearted  detectives      it s not kathleen s hand  but i ll swear it s the same notepaper    forbes was saying     under a venomous gaze from all three i took the letter out of the room  before opening it  forbes was right  it was the well known bancroft road  notepaper  it ran thus            bancroft road     wolverhampton    saturday evening     dear mr  blair     mr  dunton  the vicar of s  philip s  has just told me of your visit to  him  i am so glad to know that you take an antiquarian interest in this  region  curiously enough  only this afternoon we had two wires from our  cousin joe in oxford  one of which mentioned your being here  that gives  us additional reason for looking forward to making your acquaintance     mrs  kent wants you to come to lunch with us to morrow  at one o clock   unfortunately i myself am laid up with rheumatism  but some of the  family will be delighted to take you to see the quite surprising relics  in this vicinity  joe has probably told you all about fred  who  is really quite one of the family  the poor fellow needs exercise  dreadfully  you must take him with you if you go tramping  charlie and  oliver  my boys  are away at school     don t attempt to reply to this  but just turn up at one o clock     sincerely yours     philip kent       this gave me several reasons for thought  and disregarding the appeals  from the coffee room to come in and tell them all about it  i walked  into the courtyard of the inn to consider     first  what was the  other  wire from joe  heavens  was he on his way  from oxford to wolverhampton  if my fake telegram were discovered too  soon i should be in a very embarrassing position  second  joe was a  cousin  was he  one of those annoying second cousins  probably  who are  close enough to the family to be a familiar figure  and yet far enough  away in blood to marry the daughter  and then there was this sinister  person  fred  who was  really quite one of the family   another cousin   perhaps  what was the matter with the devil  anyway  if he needed  exercise why didn t he go and get it  certainly i didn t want to spend  an afternoon antiquarianizing with him  how was i to get him out of the  way  so that i could get a tete a tete with k      i could see that if this game was to be played through successfully it  must be played with some daring   toujours de l audace   i thought  and  let breakfast go hang  moreover  my sudden disappearance would help  to demoralize my rivals  i stuck my head into the breakfast room where  priapus was just dishing out the bacon and eggs  in that instant it  struck me again that the goblin was not there  i cried  ye gods   in a  loud voice  and slammed the door behind me  as i ran out of the front  door i laughed at the picture of their disconcerted faces     my idea was to lure fred away from bancroft road at all hazards  this  could only be done by another telegram  and as it was sunday  the  railway station was the only place to send one from  it was a beautiful   clear morning  and i hurried through the streets with exultation  but  also with a good deal of nervousness as to the outcome of this shameless  hoaxing  at any rate  i thought  i may as well live up to my privileges  as an irresponsible american  the great kathleen excursion was beginning  to take on in my mind the character of an international joust or  tourney     at the station  or at the depot as one would say at home   i sent the  following message       frederick kent          bancroft road     wolverhampton     unavoidably detained oxford hurt leg playing soccer wish you could join  me at once urgent     joe       i got back to the boar in time for a cold breakfast  none of the others  was there  i ate with my antiquarian notes on wolverhampton propped  against the coffee pot  i was determined that mr  kent should find me as  intelligent as possible     there was nothing to be done before lunch time  i read mr  kent s letter  over several times  and i must confess that the mention of that other  wire from joe worried me a good deal  just how far the telegram i had  just sent might conflict with the facts as known to the kents  i could  not surmise  i could only trust to luck and pray for the best  i learned  from the chambermaid that the goblin had come in very late the night  before  and had gone out at six a m  that bothered me almost more than  anything else     finally  after hanging round the empty coffee room for a while  i got  nervous  and determined to go to morning service at st  philip s  there  would be plenty of time to get out to bancroft road afterward  and  perhaps kathleen would be at church and i could get a distant view of  her  i walked round to the church  service had begun  but i went in  and sat down at the back  during a hymn i took a good look round  to  my horror i saw in a pew a few feet in front of me a young person whose  robust outline seemed familiar  i looked again  it was falstaff carter  in the get up of a curate  trembling with indignation  i crept out of  the church  i hardly dared speculate on what low device he had planned  for winning his way into the sanctum     at any rate  i thought  i am fixed for lunch  once i get there  i  guess i can gain ground as fast as any pseudo curate  i ran over my  antiquarian data another time     it was half past twelve  and i was just brushing my hair for the third  time  preparatory to starting for bancroft road  when the chambermaid  came to the bedroom door   this note was just left for you  sir   i tore  it open       bancroft road     sunday morning     my dear mr  blair     i am afraid you will think it very strange  but  owing to a sudden  domestic disarrangement  will you come to  supper   this evening   instead of to luncheon  i am exceedingly embarrassed to have to make  this change  but  to be quite frank  one of our maids has been taken  ill  and our luncheon to day will have to be a haphazard affair  we are  also rather distressed by strange news from our cousin at oxford     but we shall be very happy to see you at supper time  seven o clock     cordially yours     philip kent       it came over me that this was pretty dirty work we were putting up on  the poor gentleman  and i suddenly felt thoroughly ashamed of myself  i  don t know whether any of the others came back to the boar for lunch  or  not  i put on my cap and went for a long walk in the country  out toward  tettenhall wood  i didn t come back until tea time           vii      as johnny blair approached number      bancroft road  a little before  seven o clock that bland march evening  he bore within his hardy breast  certain delicacies  remorses  doubts  and revulsions  but all these were  transcended by his overmastering determination to see this superb and  long worshipped maiden near at hand     bancroft road proved to be a docile suburban thoroughfare  lined with  comfortable villas and double houses  each standing a little back from  the street with a small garden in front  a primrose coloured afterglow  lingered in the sky  and the gas lights along the pavement still burned  pale and white  just as the rhodes scholar passed number     he saw a  feminine figure run down the steps of a house fifty yards farther on   cross the pavement  and drop a letter into the red pillar box standing  there  even at that distance  he distinguished a lively slimness in  the girlish outline that could belong to no other than the incomparable  kathleen  he hastened his step  casting hesitance to the wind  but she  had already run back into the house     it would have added to the problems mr  blair was pondering could he  have read the letter which had just dropped into the post box  perhaps  it will somewhat advance the course of the narrative to give the reader  a glimpse of it            bancroft road     sunday afternoon     dear joe     goodness knows what has happened to this usually placid house   never again will i complain to you that there is no excitement in  wolverhampton     i got home from birmingham yesterday noon and since then everything has  been perfectly absurd  i can only believe you have gone balmy     first comes your wire about mr  blair and your having hurt your arm  playing soccer  what you can have been doing at soccer i can t conceive   i supposed it was a mistake for hockey  or else some kind of a twit   well  i couldn t see what i could do to help a historical student but  i showed dad the wire and the old dear said he would write mr  blair a  line     i had just settled down to help mother with some sewing when along comes  your second wire  addressed to her  mother and i threw up our hands and  screamed  certainly we thought you were off your crumpet  why on earth  should you send us another cook when you know ethel has been here for  so long  i read the wire forward and backward but it could mean nothing  else  it said   have found very good cook out of place am sending her  to you earnestly recommend give her a trial reliable woman but eccentric  name eliza thick will call sunday morning      well  we all had a good laugh over this  and wondered what kind of a  joke you were up to  then  after supper  to our amazement  came a third  wire  not from you  this one  but to dad  and who do you suppose from   the bishop of oxford if you please  dad was so flustered  you know how  telegrams excite him  they offend all his antiquarian instincts    well   the bishop said   am sending my favourite curate to call on you  magnificent young fellow excellent family very worthy chap will be in  wolverhampton a day or two anxious to have him meet your family      well  this rather flabbergasted us  but dad took it rather as a matter  of course  after the first surprise  he used to know the bishop well  in  fact  he dedicated his book to him   quite all right  my dear   dad kept  saying   i dare say the young man has some antiquarian problems to talk  over  too bad i m so crippled with rheumatism      after supper along came mr  dunton  and began to talk about a charming  young american who had been calling on him  and who did it prove to be  but your friend mr  blair  who had been quite put out of our minds by  the later telegrams  so dad sat down right away and wrote a note to mr   blair at the blue boar asking him for luncheon to day  and sent it up by  the gardener s boy     but this morning  when i had just decided not to go to church  you ll  see why in a minute  comes your perfectly mad message to fred  about  hurting your leg at soccer and all the rest of it  this convinced us  that you are quite crazy  how could we send fred all that way alone  and  when did you take up soccer anyway     but we know what a mad creature you are anyway  so we simply suspected  some deep laid twit  now i come to the queerest thing of all     ethel went out last night  for her usual saturday evening off  and  hasn t returned  in all the years she s been with us  mother says  it s  the first time such a thing ever happened  and before breakfast this  morning  turns up this eliza thick person of yours  with a note from  ethel to say that she was sick but that her friend eliza would see us  through for a day or so  well  you surely have a queer eye for picking  out domestics  of all the figures of fun i ever imagined  she is the  strangest  i don t think she s quite right in her head  i ll tell you  all about her when i see you  really  i roar with laughter every time i  look at her     i haven t got time to say more  with this eliza person in the kitchen  goodness knows what may happen  we had to send a note to mr  blair not  to come for luncheon  the house was so upset  we heard a fearful uproar  in the lower regions this afternoon and found eliza engaged in ejecting  some kind of gas man who said he had come to see the meter  on sunday   if you please      everything seems quite topsy turvy  and mr  blair is coming to supper in  a few minutes  and that favourite curate of the bishop s  too  i think  i shall have to stay down in the kitchen to see that eliza thick gets  through with it all right  i can forgive you almost anything except her     never  never say again that nothing happens in bancroft road     yours     kathleen           viii      a ruddy cheeked housemaid in the correct evening uniform admitted blair   and in the drawing room he found mr  kent sitting by a shining fire   points of light twinkled in the polished balls of the brass andirons  as  soon as he entered  blair felt the comely atmosphere of a charming and  well ordered home  books lined the walls  a french window opened on to  the lawn at the far end of the room  a large bowl of blue hyacinths   growing in a bed of pebbles  stood on the reading table  mr  kent was  small  gray haired  with a clear pink complexion and a guileless blue  eye      mr  blair   he said  laying down his paper   i am very glad to meet  you  a friend of joe s is always welcome here  and particularly when  he s an antiquarian  i know you ll excuse our seeming rudeness in  putting you off at luncheon      blair bowed  and made some polite reply      as a matter of fact   said mr  kent   my wife was embarrassed this  morning by strange happenings in the domestic department  our cook   usually very faithful  did not turn up  and sent a substitute who has  caused her  well  mingled annoyance and amusement  i have not seen the  woman myself  my rheumatism has kept me pretty close to the fire this  damp weather  but by all accounts the creature is very extraordinary   well  well  you are not interested in that  of course  it is very  pleasant to meet a fellow antiquarian  how did you happen to visit  wolverhampton  we have a number of quite unusual relics in these parts   but they are not so well known as they should be       to tell the truth  sir   said blair   it was your book  which i came  across in the college library  i was particularly interested in your  account of st  philip s church  and i made up my mind that i ought to  see it  you see  we in america have so little antiquity of our own that  these relics of old england are peculiarly fascinating to us       quite so  quite so   said mr  kent  rubbing his hands with pleasure    magnificent  well  well  it is certainly a delight to hear you say so   after supper we will dismiss the ladies and have a good crack  there  are some really startling things to be learned about wolverhampton in  anglo saxon times  you know the town lay along the frontier that was  much harried by the danes  and edward the elder won a conspicuous  victory over the invaders at tettenhall  which is a village very near  here       yes   said blair   i walked out there this afternoon       did you  indeed  well  that was a proof of your perspicacity  you may  recall that in my book i referred to the battle at tettenhall        that was in      was it not   queried blair  adroitly      precisely  it is mentioned in the anglo saxon chronicle       edward the elder died in      didn t he   asked the ruthless american      about that time  i think  i don t remember exactly  upon my word  mr   blair  you have taken up history with true american efficiency  i do  wish that our young men had the same zeal  i am happy to say  however   that i am expecting a young cleric this evening  a protege of the bishop  of oxford  who is  i believe  also interested in these matters      blair s heart sank  but he had no time to ponder  for at this moment  mrs  kent and kathleen came in      my dear  this is mr  blair  joe s friend from oxford  we are great  cronies already  my wife  mr  blair  and my daughter kathleen      the young oxonian suffered one of the most severe heart contusions  known in the history of the human race  it was a positive vertigo of  admiration  this was indeed the creature he had seen on the railway  platform  a dazzling blend of girl and woman  the grotesque appellation   flapper  fled from his mind  her thick  dark hair was drawn smoothly  across her head and piled at the back in a heavenly coil  her clear gray  eyes  under rich brown brows  were cool  laughing  and self possessed   she was that most adorable of creatures  the tweenie  between girl and  woman  with the magic of both and the weaknesses of neither  blair  could not have said how she was dressed  he saw only the arch face  the  intoxicating clearness of her skin  the steady  friendly gaze      how do you do   he said  and remembering english reticence  hesitated  to put out his hand  then cursed himself for not having done so     kathleen smiled  and murmured   how do you do       i m very glad to see you   said mrs  kent   do tell us what that crazy  joe has been up to  did mr  kent tell you we ve had three telegrams from  her      blair felt the room twirl under his feet  how one little pronoun can  destroy a man  in his agony he saw mrs  kent and kathleen sit down on  the big couch  and painfully found his way to a chair      i  i beg your pardon   he stammered   i didn t just catch        the mad girl has sent us three telegrams   said mrs  kent   in which  there was only one sensible thing  the reference to yourself  her other  remarks  about cooks and soccer and injured limbs  were quite over our  heads      with a dull sense of pain blair felt kathleen s bright eyes on him      yes  mr  blair  is she ragging us  or have the girls at maggie hall  taken up soccer   said a clear voice  every syllable of which seemed so  precious and girlish and quaintly english that he could have clapped his  hands     he blessed her for the clue   maggie hall    in other words  lady  margaret hall  one of the women s colleges at oxford  so  joe  was  in  american parlance  a  co ed       why  er  i believe they  have  been playing a little   he said  desperately   i think he  er  something was said about having  his  hum  her  arm  hurt in a rough game       her leg  too   said mr  kent   in my time  young girls didn t send  telegrams about their legs  in fact  they didn t send telegrams at all       well  we are quite nonplussed   said mrs  kent   kathleen says joe must  have had a rush of humour to the head  she wired for us to send fred  down to her  of course she has sent wires to fred before  as a joke  but  she must have known we couldn t send him so far alone  i suppose joe has  told you all about fred  he s quite one of the family       yes   said the distracted oxonian   he must be a fine fellow  i m very  anxious to meet him      there was a ring at the front door bell  and in a kind of stupor blair  realized that something  he hardly knew what  was about to happen      the reverend mr  carter   announced the maid     blair had a keen desire to scream  but he kept his eyes firmly on the  rug until he had mastered himself  in the general movement that followed  he had presence of mind enough to seize a chair next to kathleen  he  saw falstaff s burly figure enter  habited as the conventional  black  beetle  of the church  and in the sharpened state of his wits noticed  that the unpractised curate had put on his clerical collar the wrong  way round  he rejoiced in carter s look of dismay on finding his  fellow scorpion already on the battlefield      mr  carter   said mr  kent   this is mr  blair  of trinity      the two shook hands gravely     blair determined to make use of his hard won information to set carter  astray      i know mr  carter by reputation   he said   i have heard joe speak of  him in terms of great admiration      the curate looked worried  but tried to play safe      oh  yes  joe   he said   splendid chap      blair made haste to get back to the chair he coveted  he had no idea  what mad schemes might lurk beneath carter s episcopalian frock  and was  determined to gain any headway he could      it seems funny your coming to wolverhampton   said kathleen   so few   varsity men ever get here  but it s certainly a blessing for dad  he ll  talk antiquities with you as long as you like       are you interested in the subject   asked blair      i m afraid not   she laughed   it s too bad dad is so laid up with his  lumbago  he d love to walk you out to tettenhall and boscobel  to see  his burial mounds       how very interesting   said blair   a kind of private family cemetery       oh  dear no   declared kathleen in amazement   antiquities  you know   where the danes buried themselves       of course  of course  how i wish i could see them  are you fond of  walking       yes  when it isn t too muddy  it s been too wet lately to go out with  fred  he loves a good long walk  but he s getting old and his rheumatism  bothers him       i dare say he may have inherited that from your father       it s very common among scotties   said kathleen      oh  is your family scotch   said blair  feverishly trying to be polite      our family   queried kathleen with a smile   heavens  no  i thought you  were talking about fred  you must see him  he s somewhere around       i should love to meet him   said blair     kathleen went to the door and whistled  there was a scampering on the  stairs  and a grizzled skye terrier trotted into the room  blair and  carter looked at each other sheepishly     mr  kent had been referring to his watch several times  and blair began  to suspect that something was wrong  but just then supper was announced   as they passed into the dining room  the american thought he noticed  signs of agitation on the maid s face  he wondered secretly what the  rest of the scorpions were up to           ix       come  mr  blair   said mrs  kent   you sit there  next to mr  kent   where you can talk about archaeology  mr  carter tells me he knows  nothing about such subjects  so he will have to amuse kathleen and me       what errand brings you to wolverhampton  mr  carter   inquired blair   thinking to unmask his opponent s weapons as quickly as possible     carter was a little staggered by this  but his effrontery was up to the  test      the bishop sent me down   he said   to look over the surrounding  parishes with a view to establishing a chapel in the suburbs       how very interesting   exclaimed mr  kent   but surely this does not  lie in the oxford diocese       quite true   said carter   the bishop had to get special permission  from parliament  an old statute of the fourteenth century  i believe       indeed  indeed   cried mr  kent   how absorbing  my dear mr  carter   you must tell me more about that  i take it you are something of a  historical student  after all       i m afraid not  sir   replied carter   my studies in divinity have been  too exacting to leave much opportunity        you must not believe mr  carter s disclaimers   said blair   i have  heard of his papers before the oxford historical society  he has a very  sound antiquarian instinct  i think you would find his ideas of great  interest       we were speaking of the battle with the danes at tettenhall   observed  mr  kent  turning to blair   i think that if kathleen could arrange to  take you out there you would find the burial mounds of unusual interest   my dear  could you walk out there with mr  blair to morrow morning      kathleen assented  but blair noticed that she was not eating her soup   he also noticed that the maid  in the background  was seized with  occasional spasms  which he was at a loss to interpret      did i hear you say tettenhall   ventured carter   that is the very  place the bishop mentioned to me  he was particularly anxious that i  should go there       you must come with us  by all means   said kathleen      bravo   said mr  kent  beaming genially upon the young people   i wish  i could go with you  you know they say wulfruna  the widow of the earl  of northampton  who founded wolverhampton  had a kind of summer place  once near tettenhall  and i claim to have located  by the way  my dear   what do you suppose has happened to this soup       i think that eliza thick has a heavy hand with the condiments   said  mrs  kent   you may take it away now  mary       as i recall  wulfruna founded the town about       observed blair   i  presume it takes its name from her       exactly  wulfruna hampton  really  mr  blair  your historical knowledge  does you honour  i had no idea that americans were such keen students of  the past      blair began to think that he had overplayed his hand  for he noticed  that falstaff was getting in some private conversation with kathleen  he  attempted to catch her eye to ask a question  but mr  kent was now well  launched on his hobby      wulfruna was descended from ethelhild  who was a granddaughter of  alfred the great  you recall that the etheling ethelwold  the son  of alfred s brother ethelred  took sides with the danes  to stem the  invasion  edward and his sister ethelfled        ethel fled  that s just the trouble   interposed mrs  kent   kathleen   my dear  do run downstairs and see what s wrong in the kitchen  i m  afraid eliza is in difficulties again  mr  blair  you and mr  carter  must excuse this irregularity  our substitute cook is a very strange  person      kathleen left the room  and it seemed to blair as though the sparkle had  fled from the glasses  the gleam of candlelight from the silver  across  the cloth he had watched her  girlish  debonair  and with a secret  laughter lurking in her eyes  and yet he had not had a chance to  exchange half a dozen sentences with her     the maid reentered  whispered something to mrs  kent  and began to place  the dishes for the next course      kathleen begs to be excused   said mrs  kent   she thinks she had  better stay in the kitchen to help eliza       oh  i say   cried the curate   that s too bad  do you think i could  help  mrs  kent  i m a very good cook  the bishop himself has praised  my  er  my        your what   asked blair      my ham and eggs   retorted the cleric      perhaps you will let me wash the dishes   suggested blair   i should  be only too happy to assist  i feel very embarrassed at having intruded  upon you at so inconvenient a time       i should not dream of such a thing   said mrs  kent   i believe that  eliza is perfectly capable  but as joe said  she is eccentric       i am quite accustomed to washing dishes   said carter   in fact  the  bishop always used to ask me to do it for him       dear me   remarked mr  kent   surely the bishop has plenty of servants  to help in such matters      blair applied himself to the food on his plate to which he had helped  himself almost unconsciously  he well knew the daring hardihood of  his rival  and feared that the other might find some excuse to follow  kathleen to the kitchen  as he raised his fork to his lips  suddenly his  hand halted  the dish was stuffed eggs  his mind reverted to the public  library the evening before  was it possible that the goblin       he determined that the first thing to be done was to get carter so  firmly engaged with mr  kent that the wolf in cleric s clothing could  not withdraw  then perhaps he himself could frame some excuse for seeing  what was going on downstairs      mr  kent   he said   you should draw out mr  carter concerning his  views on amending the liturgy of the established church  he has some  very advanced ideas on that subject which have attracted much attention  at oxford  one of his interesting suggestions is that radical churchmen  should wear the clerical collar back side foremost  as a kind of symbol  of their inverted opinions      the wretched carter s hand flew to his neck  and he glared across the  table in a very unecclesiastical manner      really   said mr  kent   that is most interesting  i had noticed his  modification of the customary dress  in what other ways  mr  carter   would you amend the ritual      the unfortunate curate was caught      er  hum  well  that is  the bishop and i both think that the service is  too long   he faltered   i am in favour of omitting the sermon       hear  hear   cried mr  kent   it is most refreshing to hear a high  churchman make such a confession  and what else do you propose       why  ah  hum  it has always seemed to me that the  thirty nine articles  might  well  be somewhat condensed       bravo indeed  though i fear the bishop would balk at that   said his  host     the maid  appearing in the dining room again  whispered to mrs  kent      philip   said the latter   that gas man is here again  and says he   must  see the meter  he claims that there is a dangerous leak which  should be fixed at once  perhaps i had better go down to the cellar with  him  your rheumatism        my dear mrs  kent   cried the curate  seeing his chance   do nothing of  the sort  it is the privilege of my cloth to take precedence when there  is danger of any kind  if any one should be overcome by fumes  the  consolations of the church may be needed   and without waiting for  another word  he leaped up and ran from the room     blair fidgeted in his chair  seeing himself outwitted  but there was  nothing he could do      pray go on with your supper  mr  blair   urged kent   you must overlook  anything that seems strange this evening  everything seems to be  widdershins  perhaps because it is st  patrick s day  i do believe that  woman in the kitchen is at the bottom of it all  these stuffed eggs are  positively uneatable  if i were not crippled with this lumbago i would  go down and fire her out of the house       let me do it for you   cried blair  half rising from his seat      nonsense  i m not going to sacrifice our good talk on antiquities so  easily  i want very much to tell you about the battle of wolverhampton   the town was strongly loyalist in the great rebellion  in fact  in       it was the headquarters of prince rupert  while charles the first is  said to have stopped at the blue boar for a drink       at this moment came a ring at the front door  and mr  kent stopped to  listen  they heard a male voice mumbling to the maid  who then came to  her mistress to report      there s a policeman out here  ma am  to see mr  kent       a policeman   queried the antiquarian   what next  i wonder  well   supper is suspended  send him in      and to blair s dismay the gigantic form of whitney  the iron duke   crossed the threshold  in the correct uniform of the wolverhampton  police force     if blair was dismayed  the counterfeit policeman was no less disgusted  to see his fellow scorpion sitting at the dinner table  but they gazed  at each other without any sign of recognition      begging your pardon for interrupting  sir  but the chief sent me around  for a word with you  there s been a gang o  sneak thieves operating   round  ere  sir  and some of  em  as been getting admittance to  ouses  by passin  themselves off as gas inspectors  sir      mrs  kent screamed      i  ad a notion that one o  these birds is along bancroft road to night   sir  an  i wanted to warn you  don t let the maid admit any tradesmen or  agents from the gas company unless they  as the proper badges  sir       heavens  philip   cried mrs  kent   that dreadful man is downstairs  now  eliza threw him out once this afternoon  but he s here again  he  may have murdered mr  carter by this time  oh  inspector  do hurry  down at once and see what s happened  there s a defenceless high church  curate in the cellar with him  mary  show the way downstairs      blair poured out a glass of water for mrs  kent      don t you think i had better go down  too   he asked      oh  please don t go   begged mrs  kent  faintly   stay here  in case he  should escape upstairs  i believe we shall all be murdered in our beds       come  come   said mr  kent   we mustn t let all this spoil mr  blair s  supper  have another glass of wine  the policeman will attend to the  gas man  we don t often get a chance to talk to a genuine antiquarian   i think  mr  blair  that you will be greatly interested in the  architectural restoration of our parish church  it exemplifies the worst  excesses of the mid victorian period  the church itself is one of the  finest examples of the cruciform type  the south transept dates from the  thirteenth century  the nave  clerestory  and north transept from the  fifth  the chancel was restored in       but i must confess that the  treatment of the clerestory seems to me barbarous  now what are your own  ideas as to the proper treatment of a clerestory      the wretched american was non plussed  he had a shrewd suspicion that  matters were moving rapidly downstairs yet he did not see any way of  leaving the dining room to investigate for himself  he had hardly heard  what was said      why  ah  to tell you the truth  mr  kent  i read very little fiction  nowadays  i m rather worried about that gas man downstairs  do you  suppose your daughter can be in any danger  there might be some sort of  explosion  don t you think i had better run down to see if i can help      as they sat listening kathleen s voice was heard from the kitchen   raised in clear and angry tones     blair could contain himself no longer  with an inarticulate apology he  hurried out of the room  leaving the puzzled antiquarian and his wife  alone at the supper table           x      the rhodes scholar was correct in having feared the goblin as a  dangerous competitor in the quest of the grail  king  as we have  intimated before  was a quaint minded and ingenious person  modest in  stature but with a twinkling and roving eye  he was one of the leading  spirits of the ouds  known in full as the oxford university dramatic  society  and his ability to portray females of the lower classes had  been the delight of more than one shakespearean rendering  no one who  saw him as juliet s nurse in a certain private theatrical performance in  the hall of new college can recall the occasion without chuckles     when the goblin left the blue boar on saturday afternoon he also made  his way out to bancroft road  but instead of patrolling the main street  in the vague hope of catching a glimpse of kathleen  as did falstaff   priapus  and the iron duke   he hunted out the hinder regions of the  district  in accordance with a plan he had concocted before leaving  oxford  he carried a little portfolio of  art subjects   of the kind  dear to domestic servants  and with this in hand he approached the door  of the basement back kitchen  where ethel the cook and her assistant   mary  the housemaid  were having a mid afternoon cup of tea  the  windings of the humbler lanes of service  behind the bancroft road  houses  were the proper causeway for tradesmen  and it was easy for him  to reach the back garden gate unseen by those in front     he knocked respectfully at the kitchen door  and mary came to answer      good day  miss   said the supposed pedlar   i  ave some very pretty  pictures  ere which i wish you would let me show you      mary was a simple minded creature  but she knew that her mistress had  strict rules about pedlars      i m sorry   she said   but missus don t let no pedlars in the house       if you please  miss   said the artful goblin   i am no pedlar  but  representing a very respectable photographer  and i would like to show  you some photographs in the  ope of getting your order  i  ave taken  a number of orders at the nicest  ouses along bancroft road  i thought  maybe you would like to  ave a photo of yourself taken  to send to your  young man   and he opened his case  exhibiting a sheaf of appropriate  photos     it was a slender chance  but the pedlar had a wheedling eye and a  genteel demeanour  and mary hesitated  she called the cook  a stout   middle aged person  who came to the door to see what was up  the pedlar  rapidly showed the best items of his collection  which he had selected  with great care in a photographer s studio in oxford  fate hung in the  scales  but the two servants could not resist temptation  they knew that  mrs  kent and miss kathleen were upstairs sewing  and the master was  confined to his study with his rheumatism  they invited the photographer  into the kitchen     it is a psychological fact well known to housekeepers that there is a  vacant hour in the middle of the afternoon when satan sometimes finds  a joint in the protective armour of the domestic servant  after the  luncheon dishes are washed and put away  and before five o clock tea  and toast are served  cook and housemaid enjoy a period of philosophic  contemplation or siesta  even in the most docile and kitchen broken  breast thoughts of roses and romance may linger  dreams of moving  pictures or the coming cotillion of the icemen s social harmony  usually  this critical time is whiled away by the fiction of nat gould or bertha  clay or harold bell wright  and close observers of kitchen comedy will  have noted that it is always at this fallow hour of the afternoon that  pedlars and other satanic emissaries sharpen their arrows and ply their  most plausible seductions     the goblin has never admitted just what honeyed sophistries he employed  to win the hearts of the simple pair in mrs  kent s kitchen  but the  facts may be briefly stated by the chronicler  after getting them  interested in his photos he confessed frankly that he was an old friend  of the family from oxford  he said that he and miss kathleen were  planning an innocent practical joke on the family  and asked if he could  take the place of one of the servants for that sunday  he made plain  that his share in the joke must not be revealed to any one  and then  he played his trump card by showing them the text of the bogus telegram  recommending miss eliza thick  which he had dispatched from a branch  postal office on his way through the town      and is miss josephine in the joke  too   inquired the cook     this question startled the goblin  but he kept his composure and  affirmed that he and miss josephine had concocted the telegram jointly  in oxford  and by a little adroit pumping he learned  joe s  status  in the family  the cook  ethel  admitted that she was to go out that  evening for her saturday night off  at last the goblin  by desperate  cunning and the exhibition of two golden sovereigns  completely won the  hearts of the maids  while they were talking the door bell rang  and  mary  returning from the upper regions  announced that it was  another  telegram from miss joe  missus and miss kathleen laughed fit to kill  when they read it   she said      you see   said the goblin   that s the same telegram i just showed you   it s all right  it s a joke  you don t need to worry  cook  mrs  kent  won t be angry with you  you let me take your place for to morrow  and  write a little note saying you re ill and that your friend eliza thick  will do your work for the day      it was arranged that the goblin should meet ethel at her home that night  to borrow some clothes  the cook showed him the menu for sunday that  mrs  kent had sent down  this rather daunted the candidate for kitchen  honours  but he copied it in his notebook for intensive study  then   as it was close upon tea time  he packed up the photos  distributed his  largesse  and retired  mary  the housemaid  promised to stand by him in  the coming ordeal  both the servants felt secretly flattered that they  should be included in the hoax  the kitchen classes in england have  great reverence for young  varsity men     the goblin was a canny man  and he had brought with him a wig and  certain other properties  he hunted out a little tea shop  where he  meditated over three cups of pekoe and hot buttered toast  then he  made his way to the public library  where he spent several hours over  a cook book  he was complimenting himself on having shaken the other  scorpions off his trail when blair looked over his shoulder and caught  a glimpse of the stuffed eggs recipe to which the goblin was addressing  himself for the fourth time  the meeting was embarrassing  but it could  not be helped  after blair had left him  the cook to be returned to his  memoranda     mrs  kent trusted many things to ethel s judgment  and her instructions  as jotted down on a slip of paper included three possibilities    eggs   stuffed  devilled  or farci    she had written  and the goblin was  endeavouring to decide which of these presented the least distressing  responsibility  he was a student of mathematics  and had attempted to  reduce the problem to a logical syllabus  he read over his memoranda         theorem  stuffed eggs        data   six hard  boiled eggs     minutes         a  cut eggs in halves lengthwise      b  remove yolks  and put whites aside in pairs      c  mash yolks  and add            half the amount of devilled ham             enough melted butter to make of consistency to shape               half  what  amount of devilled ham   thought the            goblin   and where does the devilled ham come from  how            does one devil a ham  what a pity henry james never            wrote a cook book  it would have been lucid compared to            this   to make of consistency to shape   what on earth            does that mean        d  clean and chop two chickens  livers  sprinkle with onion    juice  and saute in butter    no   he cried   that s  eggs    farci   wrong theorem          d  make in balls   make  what  in balls    size of original    yolks   note  remember to measure original yolks before cutting    them lengthwise        e  refill whites   let s see  what did i fill  em with    before        f  form remainder of mixture into a nest    that s a nice    little homely touch        g  arrange eggs in the nest and            pour over one cup white sauce               memo  see p      for white sauce               sprinkle with buttered crumbs               allow plenty of time for buttering those crumbs             that sounds rather ticklish work               bake until crumbs are brown      h  garnish with a border of toast points and a wreath of    parsley       q  e  d        integral calculus is a treat compared to this   he said to himself  as he reviewed the problem   i hope they have plenty of parsley in the  house  that nest may need a little protecting foliage  i don t see how  i can make any kind of proper asylum for those homeless  wandering eggs  out of that mess   so saying  he left the library to call upon ethel at  her home and complete his disguise           xi      mrs  kent was a deal puzzled by the bearing and accoutrements of her  substitute cook  eliza thick appeared on the premises about seven  o clock  and with the aid of the housemaid breakfast went through fairly  smoothly  it was kathleen s query about the coffee that elicited the  truth  mary  with nervous gigglings  announced to her mistress  that ethel was ill and had sent a substitute  the coincidence that  josephine s nominee should turn out to be a friend of ethel struck  mrs  kent as strange  and presently she went down to interview the new  kitcheneer     eliza thick  a medium sized but rather powerfully fashioned female   generously busted and well furnished with rich brown hair  was washing  the dishes  she curtseyed respectfully as mrs  kent entered the kitchen      good morning   said mrs  kent   you are eliza thick       yes  ma am       you brought a note from ethel       yes  ma am   and fumbling in an opulent bosom  eliza drew forth a  crumpled scrap of paper      i had a telegram from my niece in oxford recommending you  how did she  know of you       i worked at lady marg ret  all  ma am  where the young lady is  studyin        why did you leave your place there       if you please  ma am  my dishes was so tasty that it made the young  ladies discontented when they got  ome  their parents complained that  it gave  em too  igh ideas about wittles  the principal said i was  pamperin   em too much  an  offered to release me      mary  who was listening  gave a loud snort of laughter  which she tried  to conceal by rattling some plates      well  eliza   said mrs  kent   that will do  you must get on with the  work as best you can  judging by the coffee this morning  i don t think  your cooking will have the same effect on us that it did on the students  at lady margaret hall  we were expecting a guest for lunch but i will  have to put him off until supper  i have written out the menu for the  day  mary will give you any help she can       if you please  ma am   said eliza      yes       cook gave me a message for miss kathleen  ma am  which she asked me to  deliver in person       a message for miss kathleen       yes  ma am       well  you can tell me  i will tell miss kathleen       cook said i was to give it to her personally   said the persistent  eliza      how very extraordinary   said mrs  kent   what did you say was the  matter with ethel  is it anything contagious       oh  no  ma am  i think it s just a touch of  of nervous debility   ma am  too many white corpuscles  ma am       well  i don t think miss kathleen can come down now  eliza  we have  just had a very strange telegram which has rather upset us       yes  ma am      the new cook sat down to peel potatoes and study the mechanics of  kitchencraft  she found much to baffle her in the array of pots and  pans  and in the workings of the range  from a cupboard she took out  mince meat choppers  potato mashers  cream whippers  egg beaters  and  other utensils  gazing at them in total ignorance of their functions   mrs  kent had indicated jugged hare and mashed potatoes for lunch  and  after some scrutiny of the problem eliza found a hammer in the cabinet  with which she began to belabour the vegetables  mary  who might have  suggested boiling the potatoes first  was then upstairs     by and by kathleen heard the thumping  and came into the kitchen to  investigate      good morning  eliza       good morning  miss   said the delighted cook   oh  i  am  so happy to  see you  miss       thank you  eliza  did you have a message for me from ethel       yes  miss  er  ethel said she hoped you d give me all the help you can   miss  because  er  you see  miss  cooking for a private family is very  different from working in a college where there are so many  miss       i see  well  what on earth are you doing to those potatoes  eliza       mashing  em  miss       what  with a  hammer        i washed the  ammer  miss       surely you didn t mash them that way at maggie hall  eliza       yes  miss  the young ladies got so they couldn t abide them done any  other way      kathleen looked more closely  and examined the badly bruised tubers    good gracious   she exclaimed  with a ripple of laughter   they haven t  been cooked yet      eliza was rather taken aback      well  you see  miss   she said   at the college we used nothing but  fireless cookers  and i don t understand these old fashioned stoves very  well  i wanted to get you to explain it to me       it s perfectly simple   said kathleen   this is the oven  and when you  want to bake anything   phew    she cried  opening the oven door   what   have  you got in here      she took a cloth  and lifted out of the oven a tall china pitcher with a  strange looking object protruding from it     eliza was panic stricken  and for an instant forgot her role      my god  i put the hare in there and forgot all about it  what a bally  sell      kathleen removed the hideous thing  hardly knowing whether to laugh or  cry      look here  eliza   she said   they may jug hares that way at maggie  hall  but i doubt it  now  what  can  you cook  we ve got guests coming  to night  a gentleman from america is going to be here and we must put  our best foot forward      eliza s face was a study in painful emotion      excuse me  miss   she said   but is that american gentleman called mr   blair       yes   said kathleen   really  eliza  you are most extraordinary  how  did you know       i ve heard of him   said eliza   i think i ought to warn you against  him  miss  he s  he s a counterfeiter       nonsense  eliza  what notions you do have  he s an antiquarian  and  he s coming to see my father about archaeology  he s a friend of miss  josephine  from oxford  now i think you d better get on with your  cooking and not worry about counterfeiters       miss kathleen   said eliza   i think i d better be frank with you  i  want to tell you       here mary came into the kitchen  and although eliza thick made frantic  gestures to her to keep away  the housemaid was too dense to understand   the opportunity for confession was lost      now  eliza   said kathleen   mary will help you in anything you re not  certain about  i ll come down again later to see how you re getting on      by supper time that night eliza thick began to think that perhaps she  had made a tactical error by interning herself in the kitchen where  there was but small opportunity for a tete a tete with the bewitching  kathleen  the news that blair was coming to the evening meal was highly  disconcerting  and the worried cook even contemplated the possibility  of doctoring the american s plate of soup with ratsbane or hemlock  once  during the afternoon she ventured a sally upstairs  carrying a scuttle  of coal as a pretext  in the vague hope of finding kathleen somewhere  about the house  unfortunately she met mrs  kent on the stairs  who  promptly ordered her back to her proper domain  here eliza found a  disreputable looking person trying to cozen mary into admitting him to  the house  he claimed to be an agent of the gas company  in search of  a rumoured leak  eliza immediately spotted priapus  and indignantly  ejected him by force of arms  in the scuffle a dish pan and several  chairs were overturned  mary  whose nerves were rather unstrung by the  sustained comedy she was witnessing  uttered an obbligato of piercing  yelps which soon brought kathleen to the scene  eliza received a severe  rating  and so admired the angry sparkle in kathleen s eyes that she  could hardly retort      one other thing  eliza   said kathleen  in conclusion   there are to be  two guests at supper  mr  carter  a curate from oxford  is coming  too   please allow for him in your preparations       if you please  miss   cried the much goaded cook   is that mr  stephen  carter       i believe it is   said kathleen   but what of it  is he a  counterfeiter  too       miss kathleen  i know you think it strange  but i must warn you against  that curate  dear miss kathleen  he is dangerous  he is not what he  seems       eliza  you forget yourself   said kathleen  severely   mr  carter  comes with an introduction from the bishop of oxford  i hope that is  satisfactory to you  in any case  we do not need your approval for our  list of guests  mrs  kent wants you to take great care with the stuffed  eggs  those mashed potatoes made her quite ill       please  miss  i m dreadful worried about those eggs  the book says  to make a nest for  em  and truly i don t know how to go about it  the  young ladies at college never ate their eggs in nests  miss  and when i  gets nervous i can t do myself justice  miss  i never can remember which  is the yolks and which is the whites  miss       now  that will do  eliza   said kathleen   you are a very eccentric  creature  but i don t think you are as stupid as all that  what do  you want  do you expect me to come down here and oversee all your  preparations       oh  if you only would  miss  it would be  so  gratifying      kathleen laughed  a girlish bubbling of pure mirth  which was dreadful  torment to the jealous masquerader  she departed  leaving the cook a  prey to savage resolve   well   thought eliza   if the supper is bad  enough i guess she ll just  have  to come down and help me  thank  goodness blair and carter are  both  coming  they ll cut each other s  throats  and perhaps the stuffed eggs will win after all  as for that  gas man  he won t get into this house unless it s over my dead body            xii      it was a feverish and excited eliza that kathleen found in the kitchen  when she tripped downstairs after the soup course  on a large platter  the cook had built a kind of untidy thicket of parsley and chopped  celery  eked out with lettuce leaves  ambushed in this were lurking  a number of very pallid and bluish looking eggs  with a nondescript  stuffing bulging out of them      i forgot to measure the yolks  miss   wailed eliza   that s why the  stuffing don t fit  shall i throw a dash of rum on board to stiffen  em  up      in spite of her vexation  kathleen could not help laughing   no  no    she said   we ll tidy up the nest a bit and send them upstairs       that s grand   said eliza  watching kathleen s quick fingers    tis  a beautiful comely hand you have  miss  one that it s a pleasure to  admire       now  eliza   said kathleen   you must not shout up the dumb waiter so   i distinctly heard you cry out   this plate s for the parson    as you  sent up one of the dishes of soup       if you please  miss   said eliza   that was because it was the plate i  spilled a spoonful of pepper into  and i thought it had better go to the  cloth than anywhere else  miss kathleen  i have something very urgent to  say to you before them two counterfeiters upstairs commit any affidavits  or sworn statements       you dish out the eggs  eliza   said kathleen   and i ll send them up  the dumb waiter  quick  now  and where s your dessert  is it ready       all doing finely  miss   answered eliza  but as she opened the oven  door her assurance collapsed  she drew out a cottage pudding  blackened  and burnt to carbon      a great success   said the bogus cook  but holding it on the other side  of her apron so that kathleen could not see   here  i ll just shoot it  up the shaft myself before it gets cold   she hurried into the pantry   whisked it into the dumb waiter before kathleen could catch a glimpse   and sent it flying aloft      that smelt a little burnt  cook   said kathleen      just a wee bit crisp on one side  miss      kathleen was in the pantry  with her nose up the dumb waiter shaft   sniffing the trail of the cottage pudding and wondering whether she  ought to recall it for inspection  when eliza  turning toward the back  door  saw the gas man on the threshold  the cook s mind moved rapidly in  this emergency  she knew that if priapus found himself face to face with  kathleen  dangerous exposures would follow at once      mary   she whispered to the maid  who had just come down from upstairs    run tell the mistress the gas man is here again  i ll send him down  the cellar   and while kathleen was still in the pantry and before the  pseudo gas man could demur  eliza seized him by the coat and hurried  him across the kitchen to the cellar door  she opened this and pointed  downstairs  the bewildered gas man disappeared down the steps and eliza  closed the door and turned the key      now  miss   said eliza   i have something very serious to say to you       just at that moment she saw the clerical black of the reverend mr   carter coming down the kitchen stairs        and that is  we d best get this fruit up without delay   and seizing  a large bowl of apples  oranges  and bananas  she passed it to kathleen  and backed her into the pantry again  kathleen unsuspectingly pushed the  fruit up the dumb waiter and meanwhile it took no more than an instant  for eliza to take the curate by the arm  motion him to silence  and push  him toward the cellar door      he s down there   she whispered  and carter innocently followed his  fellow scorpion  again eliza closed the door and turned the key      well  eliza   said kathleen   i don t think you re much of a cook  but  you re a willing worker       miss kathleen   said the cook  who was now more anxious than ever  to cleanse her bosom of much perilous stuff   are you very down on  practical jokes       practical jokes  why  yes  eliza  i think they are the lowest form of  humour  good gracious  i do believe we ve forgotten the coffee  have you  got it ready       yes  miss  yes  miss  right here   said eliza  bustling to the stove    but don t you think  miss  that a frank confession atones for a great  deal       really  eliza  you are the most priceless creature  i don t wonder  joe was taken with you  hush  there s the front door bell  what do you  suppose that is      they both listened  kathleen at the dumb waiter shaft and eliza at the  kitchen door  eliza started to say something  but kathleen waved her  to be quiet  a heavy step sounded on the stair  and the agitated mary  appeared  followed by a huge policeman  eliza  of course  recognized the  iron duke  but the gas light and the disguise prevented the latter from  knowing his fellow venturer      what on earth is the matter   said kathleen      please  miss   said the blue coat   your mother said there s a gas man  down here and i ve been sent by headquarters to take him in charge  i  think he s a sneak thief       there s no such person here  officer   said kathleen     eliza still kept her sovereign wits about her  she advanced to the  policeman  and whispering mysteriously  he s in here   took his sleeve  and led him to the cellar door      he s down there   she repeated   put the cuffs on him  quick   she  opened the door  and the doubtful policeman  hypnotized by her decision   stepped on to the cellar stairs  the door closed behind him  and again  eliza turned the key      what does all this mean   demanded kathleen  angrily   has everybody  gone daft  eliza  ever since you came into the house  there has been  nothing but turmoil  i wish you would explain  why have you sent the  policeman into the cellar       there s three dangerous counterfeiters down there  miss   said eliza    i want to tell you the truth about this  miss kathleen  before that  american gets down here  he s bound to be here soon  he s the worst of  the lot       open that door at once   said kathleen  stamping her foot   i don t  know what on earth you mean by counterfeiters  but if there are any down  there  let s have them up  and see what they have to say      the dining room bell rang  and mary instinctively hurried upstairs  at  the same moment blair ran down  three steps at a time  and bounded into  the kitchen  he started when he saw eliza      are you all right  miss kent   he asked  anxiously   i ve been so  worried about you  is that gas man still here  i think i can smell gas  escaping  can i help in any way       what you smell is a burnt cottage pudding   replied kathleen   there s  a policeman in the cellar  i wish you d call him up  i have a great mind  to ask him to take eliza in charge  i don t think she s quite right      blair looked at eliza closely      i agree with you  miss kathleen   he said   she looks like a bad egg to  me  a devilled egg  in fact  which is the cellar door  cook      eliza saw her chance      right here  sir   she said  taking hold of the door knob  she swung the  door open      looks very dark   said blair   i can t quite see the step  where is  it      eliza  eager to add this last specimen to her anthology in the cellar   stepped forward to point out the stairway  with one lusty push blair  shoved her through the door  and banged it to  he turned the key in the  lock and thrust it into his pocket      miss kent   he said   i m afraid you must think us all crazy  if you  will only let me have five minutes  uninterrupted talk with you  i can  explain these absurd misadventures  please  won t you let me       to tell you the truth   said kathleen   i m hungry  i ve had only  a plate of soup  and that was  counterfeit  i think that mad woman  intended it for the curate  for whom she had conceived a dislike       let s go up and sit in the dining room  and i can talk while you eat      at that moment mrs  kent s voice sounded at the top of the stairs      kathleen  dear  is everything all right       yes  mother   called kathleen in the same silvery soprano that set  blair s heart dancing      your father wants mr  blair to come up to the drawing room and talk to  him  he wants to tell him about the battle of wolverhampton            xiii      blair  nervously playing with a key  stood by the fire in the  drawing room  mrs  kent had excused herself and gone upstairs  in the  dining room  across the hall  he could see kathleen gleaning over the  supper table while the maid cleared away the dishes  in spite of his  peevishness  he smiled to see her pick up one of the stuffed eggs on a  fork  taste it  and lay it down with a grimace  at the other end of the  drawing room mr  kent  leaning on his cane  was rummaging among some  books      here we are   said the antiquarian  hobbling back with several heavy  tomes   here is clarendon s history  now i want to read you what he has  to say about that incident in       then i will read you my manuscript  notes  to show you how they fill up the gaps  kathleen       yes  dad   answered kathleen  coming into the room      will you get me my glasses  dear       yes  indeed   and she ran across the room to fetch them from the  bookcase where he had left them  she seated herself on the arm of her  father s chair  she was a charming and graceful figure  swinging the  slender ankle that the scorpions afterward described with imaginative  fervour as  a psalm    a fairy tale   and  an aurora borealis   they  none of them ever agreed as to the dress she wore that evening  but  eliza thick  who was perhaps the most observant  declared that it looked  like a chintz curtain  i think it must have had small sprigs of flowers  printed on it  her eyes  exclaimed the broken hearted gas man  were like   a twilight with only two stars   perhaps he meant a street with two  lamps lighted      oh  i m so glad you re going to read your notes to mr  blair   she  said  mischievously   they are so fascinating  and there s such a jolly  lot of them       perhaps mr  kent s eyes are tired   said blair  hastily      not a bit  not a bit   said mr  kent   i don t often get such a good  listener  by the way  what happened to that nice young curate  i hope  the gas man didn t injure him      kathleen looked at blair with dancing eyes      he had to go   declared blair   he was awfully sorry  he asked me to  make his apologies       perhaps the bishop sent for him suddenly   said kathleen      well   resumed mr  kent   i shall begin with the battle of naseby   after that memorable struggle  a portion of the royalist forces       the front door bell trilled briskly      oh  dear me   sighed poor mr  kent  looking up from his papers   the  fates are against us  mr  blair      the scotch terrier had been lying by the fire  caressed by the toe  of kathleen s slipper  as she sat on the arm of her father s chair   suddenly he jumped up  wagging his tail  and barked with evident glee   a tall  dark eyed girl  a little older than kathleen  pushed the hall  curtains aside and darted into the room      joe  you darling   cried kathleen   how s your leg       what do you mean   asked joe   which leg  what s wrong with it       well  joe  my dear  this is a jolly surprise   said mr  kent  laying  aside his books   we heard you were laid up  some misunderstanding  somewhere  we ve got a friend of yours here  you see  mr  blair      blair wished he could have sunk through the floor  he would have given  anything to be with the other four in the darkness of the cellar  his  ears and cheeks burned painfully      how do you do  mr  blair   said josephine  cordially   there must be  some mistake  i ve never met mr  blair before       my dear joe   cried kathleen   i do think we have all gone nuts  look  here   she took three sheets of paper from the mantelpiece   did you or  did you not send us those telegrams      joe ran her eye over the messages  reading them aloud         miss kathleen kent        my friend blair of trinity now in wolverhampton for historical study  staying at blue boar nice chap american          here joe raised her eyes and looked appraisingly at blair  whose  confusion was agonizing         may he call on you if so send him a line sorry can t write hurt hand  playing soccer love to all  joe         frederick kent  unavoidably detained oxford hurt leg playing soccer  wish you could join me at once very urgent  joe         she bent down to the terrier which was standing affectionately at her  feet      well  fred  old boy   she said  patting him   did joe send you a  telegram  heh          mrs  philip kent  have found very good cook out of place am sending  her to you earnestly recommend give her a trial reliable woman but  eccentric name eliza thick will call sunday morning  joe          my dear kathleen   said joe   you flatter me  i never sent any of those  messages  do you know any other joes       i beg your pardon  miss kent   said blair   but i must tell you  i sent  two of those telegrams  and i think i can guess who sent the other  miss  eliza thick herself       you   exclaimed mr  kent and both girls in the same breath      yes  mr  kent  i blush to confess it  but you and your family have been  abominably hoaxed  and i can see nothing for it but to admit the truth   painful as it is  i prefer to tell you everything      the two girls settled themselves on the couch and mr  kent  bewildered   sat upright in his chair  the dog  satisfied that everything was serene   jumped on the divan and lay down between joe and kathleen  the unhappy  blair stood awkwardly on the hearth rug      last january   he began   a gentleman by the name of kenneth forbes   an undergraduate of merton college  now studying the gas meter in your  cellar   was in blackwell s book shop  in oxford  browsing about  lying  on a row of books in a corner of the shop he happened to see a letter   without an envelope  he picked it up and glanced at it  it had evidently  been dropped there by some customer      the address engraved on the paper was      bancroft road   wolverhampton  it was dated last october and the letter began   dear  joe  thank you so much for the tie  it is pretty and i do wear ties  sometimes  so i sha n t let the boys have it   in the upper left hand  corner were four crosses  and the words  these are from fred   the  letter was signed  kathleen       the two girls looked at each other      it so happened   continued blair   that the man who found the letter  had promised to write  the very next day  the first chapter of a serial  story for a little literary club to which he belonged  at the time when  he found this letter lying about the bookshop he was racking his brain  for a theme for his opening chapter  a great idea struck him  he put the  letter in his pocket and hurried back to his room      his idea was to build up a story around the characters of the letter   he had no idea whom it came from or to whom it was addressed  the  thought of making these unknown persons of the letter the figures of  the story appealed to him  and with an eager pen he set down the first  chapter  with  kathleen  as heroine and  joe  as hero      a faint line of colour crept up kathleen s girlish cheek      this idea  which suggested itself to forbes when he found the letter  in the bookshop  was taken up enthusiastically by the group of  undergraduates composing the little club  the fabrication of the story  was the chief amusement of the term      it would be unfair to me and to the other men not to say frankly that  the whim was not taken up in any malicious or underhand spirit  given  the idea as it first came to the man in the bookshop  the rest flowed  naturally out of it  urged by high spirits  i must tell you honestly  that the characters of that letter became very real to us  we speculated  endlessly on their personalities  tastes  and ages  we all became  frantic admirers of the lady who had signed the letter  and considered  ourselves jealous rivals of the man  joe   to whom  as we supposed  it  had been written  and when the end of term came  the five members who  had entered most completely into the spirit of the game agreed to come  to wolverhampton for the express purpose of attempting to make the  acquaintance of the kathleen who had so engaged their fancy       really  i think this is dreadfully silly   said kathleen  colouring    joe  are we characters in a serial  or are we real persons       this confession is very painful for me  mr  kent   said blair   because  things don t seem to have turned out at all as we thought  and i m  afraid we have abused your hospitality barbarously  i can only beg  that you will forgive this wild prank  which was actuated by the most  innocent motives       then do i understand   asked mr  kent   that your interest in  wolverhampton history was merely simulated  for the purpose of making  the acquaintance of my daughter       you make me very much ashamed  sir  but that is the truth      mr  kent rose to his feet  leaning on his cane      well  well   he said   i have no wish to seem crabbed  i m sorry to  lose so excellent a listener  i thought it was too good to be true  but  when one has a daughter one must expect her to grow up  and become  the heroine of serial stories  i trust that that story is not to be  published  i can ask that  at least       our intention   said blair   was to give the manuscript to miss kent as  a token of our united admiration       well   said mr  kent   make my apologies to the other conspirators  i  take it that that dreadful eliza thick was one of them  i hope our  cook will be back to morrow  upon my word  those stuffed eggs were  indescribable  joe  my dear  suppose you let me take you up to see  your aunt  i expect these people will want to recriminate each other a  little  and reach some sort of misunderstanding      joe and mr  kent left the room  but a moment later mr  kent reappeared  at the door      mr  blair   he said   please don t think me lacking in sportsmanship  i  was young once myself  i just wanted to say that i think you all staged  it remarkably well  give mr  carter my compliments on that telegram from  the bishop       good heavens   exclaimed blair  as mr  kent vanished behind the  curtains   i forgot  those fellows are still down in the cellar   he  held out the key   i must let them out       wait a minute   said kathleen   i have no desire to see that eliza  thick again  nor that odious curate  not even the enterprising gas man      for the space of fifteen thoughts or so there was silence  kathleen sat  at one end of the big couch  the firelight shimmering round her in a  softening glow  blair stood painfully at the other side of the hearth      miss kathleen   he said   i want to beg you  on behalf of the other  fellows  not to be too severe with them  i guess i m the worst offender   with my bogus telegrams and my deliberate deception of your father  but  i ought to explain that we all came here with a definite intention in  mind  the man who was first able to engage you in friendly conversation  and get you to accept an invitation to come to oxford for eights week   was to be the winner of the competition       i ve already accepted an invitation for eights week   she said  after a  pause     he uttered a dejected silence that was a classic of its kind  a marvel  of accurate registration     kathleen looked up at him for the first time since his confession of the  hoax  their eyes met      is it carter   he asked  woefully      i ve promised to go and stay with joe at maggie hall       look here   he said   i expect to row in the trinity boat  will you  and your mother and  and miss joe  watch the racing from our barge  one  afternoon anyway  then you could come to tea in my rooms afterward  and  i ll ask the other fellows in to meet you       the parson and the policeman and the gas man  and  and  eliza thick       yes  they re all splendid chaps  i know you ll like them       well   she murmured   i dare say eliza thick would be all right in his  proper costume  i shall never forget his nest building genius  now i  understand what he meant by all that talk about counterfeiters       you will come to the trinity barge   he begged     there was a pause  a dropping coal clicked in the grate  and kathleen s  small slipper tapped on the fender      i should think   she said   that a man as persistent as you would make  a good oar  i m glad the others aren t americans  too  it was bad enough  as it was       miss kathleen   he pleaded   i guess i can t make you understand what  i d like to  but if you ll just come punting up the cher  on sunday in  eights week  there are so many things i d like to tell you       yes  i ve always wanted to hear about america  and the difference  between a republican and a democrat       and you  will  come      kathleen rose  laughing      i have already accepted joe s invitation   she said   good night  mr   blair   she gave him her hand     he held it as long as he dared  looking her straight in

to read you those  notes on the battle of wolverhampton      blair looked round the room  the dog  lying by the fire  got up   stretched  and wagged his tail  blair pulled out his watch   giminy   he  said   i d better go down and let those poor devils out of the cellar        the end                          paolo in the subordinate parts  of a few frescoes  especially at luco in the mugnone  fra paolo is  the most known  but chiefly as a far off imitator of fra bartolommeo   without his mellowness of execution  his pictures are mostly from his  master s designs  which were left him as a legacy  and this ensures a  good composition     he was born at pistoja in       his father  bernardino d  antonio del  signoraccio  a second rate artist  taught him the first principles  of art  his knowledge of drawing caused him to be noticed by fra  bartolommeo  when at a very early age he entered the order  he was  removed from prato to san marco  florence  in       and here he found  another friend who assisted his artistic tendencies  this was fra  ambrogio della robbia   footnote  padre marchese  memorie   c   lib  in   chap  ii  p        who taught him to model in clay  a specimen of his  work exists in the church of sta  maddalena in pian di mugnone  where  are two statues of s  domenico and mary magdalen by his hand     his best work is a  crucifixion  at siena  dated       which has been  thought to be fra bartolommeo s  but though that master was asked to go  and paint it as a memorial of a certain messer cherubino ridolfo   his many occupations prevented his accepting the commission  and his  disciples  fra paolo and fra agostino  went in his place   footnote   padre marchese  memorie   c   lib  in  chap  ii  p        possibly the  master supplied the design  which is very harmonious  the virgin and s   john stand on each side of the cross  and saint catherine of siena and  mary magdalen are prostrate before it  one or two of the female saints  are pleasing  but the nude figure of christ is hard  exaggerated  and  faulty in drawing     the artists got thirty five lire for the work  though the record in the  archives allows that it was worth more  there is an  assumption  in the  belle arti of florence  of which the design is fra bartolommeo s  but  the colouring fra paolo s  it was painted for the dominican monks at  santa maria del sasso  near bibbiena  the colouring is hard and weak   the shadows heavy  and not fused well in the half tints  two monks on  the left are tolerably life like  probably they were drawn from living  models  the s  catherine on the right is very inferior     the belle arti also possesses a  deposition from the cross   which fra  bartolommeo had sketched out and left uncoloured at pian di mugnone  in       fra paolo finished it  and it presents the usual disparity between  the composition and colouring  the former being good  the latter weak  and crude  his best known works are a nativity in the palazzo borghese   a  madonna and child with s  john baptist  in the sciarra colonna  also  in rome  a  madonna and child with s  john  in the corsini gallery   florence  and another of the same subject in the antinori palace  he  painted also at san gimignano  pian di mugnone  and pistoja  and died of  sunstroke in          he had as a follower a suor plautilla nelli  born       daughter of a  noble florentine  piero di luca nelli  she took the vows at the age  of fourteen  in the convent of s  caterina di siena  in via larga  now  cavour   florence  her sister  suor petronilla  in the same convent   was a writer  and her life of savonarola is still extant  suor plautilla  taught herself to paint  legend says  that in order to study the nude  for a christ  she drew from the corpse of a nun  which might account for  the weak stiffness of her design  fra paolo  though there is no record  of his having taught her  left her as a legacy the designs and cartoons  of fra bartolommeo  one of which  the  pieta   she has evidently made  use of in the painting in the belle arti  the grouping is that of the   pieta  of fra bartolommeo  now in the pitti  of which she must have  had the original sketch  for she has put in the two saints in the  background  which have been painted out in that of the frate  but we  will give her the entire credit of the colouring  which is extremely  crude  the contrasting blues and yellows are in inharmonious tones  the  shading harsh  and the whole picture wanting in chiaroscuro  the corsini  gallery  florence  has a  virgin and child  by her           part ii       the scholars of mariotto albertinelli were much more important in the  annals of art  the principal ones being bugiardini  francia bigio   visino  and innocenza d  imola     giuliano bugiardini should be called the assistant rather than the  scholar of albertinelli  being older than his master  he was born in       in a suburb outside the via faenza  florence  and was placed in  the shop of domenico ghirlandajo  where his acquaintance with  michelangelo  begun in the medici gardens  ripened into intimacy  and  he was employed by him in the sistine chapel  giuliano had that happily  constructed mind which  with an ineffable content in its own works   will pass through life perfectly happy in the feeling that in reaching  mediocrity it has achieved success  not only wanting talent to produce  better works  he lacked also the faculty of perceiving where his own  were faulty  and having a great aptitude for copying the works of  others  he felt himself as great as the original artists  michelangelo  was always amused with his naive self conceit  and kept up a friendship  with him for many years  he even went so far as to sit to bugiardini for  his likeness  at the request of ottaviano de  medici  giuliano  having  painted and talked nonsense for two hours  at last exclaimed  to his  sitter s great relief   now  michelangelo  come and look at yourself  i  have caught your very expression   but what was michelangelo s horror to  see himself depicted with eyes which were neither straight nor a pair   the worthy artist looked from his work to the original  and declared he  could see no difference between them  on which michelangelo  shrugging  his shoulders  said   it must be a defect of nature   and bade his  friend go on with it  this charming portrait was presented to ottaviano  de  medici  with that of  pope clement vii    copied from sebastian del  piombo  and is now in the louvre  bugiardini s works always take the  style of other masters  there is a  madonna  in the uffizi  and one  in the leipsic museum  both in leonardo s style  with his defects  exaggerated  the former is a sickly woman in a sentimental attitude   the child rather heavy  the colouring is bright and well fused  he has  evidently adopted the method which he had seen albertinelli use in his  studio     during a stay in bologna he painted a  madonna and saints  as an  altar piece for the church of s  francesco  besides a  marriage of s   catherine   now in the bologna pinacoteca  the composition of this is  not without merit  the child jesus seated on his mother s knees  gives  the ring to s  catherine  little s  john stands at the virgin s feet  s   anthony on her left  the colouring is less pleasing  the flesh tints too  red and raw     a round picture in the zambeccari gallery  bologna  shows him in  michelangelo s style  the virgin is reading on a wooded bank  but looks  up to see the infant christ greet the approaching s  john baptist  this  is carefully  if rather hardly  painted  the lights in the saviour s  hair have been touched in with gold  the time of his stay in bologna is  uncertain  but in      he was in florence  and drawing designs for the  ringhiera with andrea del sarto  there is a document in the archives   proving that on october  th       bugiardini was paid twenty florins  in gold for his share of the work  he obtained some rank as a portrait  painter  in spite of his failure in that of michelangelo  and had  commissions from many of the celebrities of florence  it was in original  composition that his powers failed him  messer palla rucellai ordered a  picture from him of the  martyrdom of s  catherine   which he began with  the intention of making it a very fine work indeed  he spent several  years in representing the wheels  the lightnings and fires in a  sufficiently terrible aspect  but had to beg michelangelo s assistance  in drawing the men who were to be killed by those heavenly flames  his  design was to have a row of soldiers in the foreground  all knocked down  in different attitudes  his friend took up the charcoal and sketched  in a splendid group of agonised nude figures  but these were beyond his  power to shade and colour  and tribolo made him a set of models in clay   in the attitudes given by michelangelo  and from these he finished the  work  but the great master s hand was never apparent in it  bugiardini  died at the age of seventy five     of francesco bigi  commonly called francia bigio or franciabigio  so  much is said in the following life of andrea del sarto  that a slight  sketch will suffice here  he was the son of cristofano  and was born in        his early studies were made in the brancacci chapel  and the  papal hall  where he drew from the cartoons in         and the studio  of mariotto albertinelli  from which he passed to his partnership with  andrea del sarto in       thus it is that his first style was marked by  the influence of mariotto and fra bartolommeo  while in his later works  he approximated more to andrea del sarto     two of his early paintings were placed in the church of s  piero  maggiore  one a  virgin and child  of great beauty  the infant clasps  its arms round its mother s neck  a charming attitude  which suggests  a playful effort to hide from the young s  john  who is running towards  him  by nestling closer to the dearer resting place  the picture is now  in the uffizi and has been long known as  raphael s madonna del pozzo     footnote  crowe and cavalcaselle   history of painting   vol  iii   chap  xv  p        no greater testimony to francia bigio s excellence  can be given than the frequency of his works being mistaken for those of  raphael  but the influence of his contemporaries was always strong upon  him  the  annunciation   painted for the same church  is also described  by vasari as a carefully designed work  though somewhat feeble in  manner  the angel is lightly poised in air  the virgin kneeling before a  foreshortened building  the picture was lost sight of in the demolition  of the church  but crowe and cavalcaselle  footnote  crowe and  cavalcaselle   history of painting   vol  iii  p        believe they  have discovered it in a picture at turin  the authorship of which is  avowedly doubtful  they mention  however  a celestial group of the  eternal father in a cherub peopled cloud  sending his blessing in the  form of a dove  with a ray of glory  surely if this be the one described  by vasari  footnote  vasari  vol  iii  p       so minutely  he would not  have omitted a part of the subject so important to the picture     in      we may presumably date the partnership with andrea del sarto   that being about the time when they began to work together in the  scalzo  francia bigio painted some frescoes in the church of s  giobbe   behind the servite monastery  a  visitation  was in a tabernacle at the  corner of the church  and subjects from job s life on a pilaster within  it  these have long ago disappeared  the altar piece of the  madonna  and job   which he painted in oil for the same church  has been more  fortunate  as it still exists in the tuscan school in the uffizi  though  much injured  it shows his earlier style  the  calumny of apelles  in  the same gallery is a curious picture  it is hard and dull in colouring   the prevailing tone being a heavy drab  there are several nude figures   of doubtful forms as to beauty of drawing  the flesh is painted in a  smooth glazed style  without relief or tenderness     francia bigio shines more in fresco than in oil  his hardness is less  apparent  and he gains in freedom and brilliance of colouring in the  more congenial medium  the finest of his frescoes is  unfortunately   spoiled by his own hand  and remains as a memorial of his genius and  hasty temper  i allude to the  sposalizio   a d        in the courtyard  of the servite church  where andrea did his series of frescoes from the  life of filippo benizzi  the composition is grand and carefully thought  out  the colouring bright and pleasing  perhaps in emulating andrea s  luxurious style of drapery he has gone a little too far  and crowded  the folds  the bridegroom is a noble figure  and shows in his face his  gladness in the blossoming rod  a man in the foreground breaks a  stick across his knees  the commentators of vasari have taken this to  emblematize the roman catholic legend of the virgin having given rods to  each of her suitors  and chosen him whose rod blossomed  graceful women  surround the virgin  but there is perhaps a too marked sentimentality  about these which suggests a striving after raphael s style  there is   however  a great touch of nature in a mother with a naughty child  who  sits crying on the ground  much to the mother s distress  francia bigio  commenced this in andrea s absence in france  which so excited his  former comrade s emulation that he did his  visitation  in great haste   to get it uncovered as soon as francia bigio s  in fact  andrea s works  were ready by the date of the annual festa of the servites  and the  monks  being anxious to uncover all the new frescoes for that day  took  upon them to remove the mattings from that of francia bigio as well   without his permission  for he wished to give a few more finishing  touches  so angry was he  on arriving in the cloister  to see a crowd of  people admiring his work in what he felt to be an imperfect condition   that in an excess of rage he mounted on the scaffolding which still  remained  and  seizing a hammer  beat the head of the madonna to pieces   and ruined the nude figure breaking the rod  the monks hastened to the  scene in an uproar of remonstrance  the frantic artist s destructive  hand was stayed by the bystanders  but so deep was his displeasure that  he refused to restore the picture  and no other hand having touched  it  the fresco remains to this day a fine work mutilated  it shows him  artistically in his very best  and morally  at his worst  phase  in        while andrea was in france  the monks of the scalzo employed  francia bigio to fill two compartments in their pretty little cloister   where andrea had commenced his  life of s  john baptist   these are  spoken of more at length in the life of that master  who on his return  took the work again in his own hands  in      bigio competed with andrea  and pontormo  in the medici villa at poggio a cajano  andrea s  caesar  receiving tribute  occupies one wall of the hall  and francia bigio s   triumph of cicero  another  the subjects were selected by the  historian  messer paolo giovio  bishop of nocera  it only remained for  the artists to make the most of the chosen themes  francia bigio filled  his background with a careful architectural perspective  and a crowd of  muscular romans are grouped before it  this also was left unfinished  at the pope s death  and allori completed it in       francia bigio   however  did many of the gilded decorations of the hall     in the dresden gallery is a work  scenes from the life of david  signed  a  s   mdxxiii   and his monogram  a painting very much in the style of  andrea del sarto s  life of joseph   reumont  footnote  life of andrea  del sarto  p      et seq   claims it as the joint work of andrea and  francia bigio  founding his opinion on the letters a  s  before the  date  but the letters mean only  anno salutis   and are used in very  many of francia bigio s signed paintings  he had the commission from gio  maria benintendi in       it is one of those curious pictures which have  many scenes in one  a style which militates greatly against artistic  unity  on the right is david s palace  on the left uriah s  david is at  his door watching bathsheba and her maidens bathing  in the centre  is the siege of rabbah  another well draped group represents david  receiving uriah s homage  in the foreground david gives wine to uriah  at a banquet  there is careful painting and ingenious composition  but  a less finished manner of colouring than in andrea s joseph  which was  painted about the same time for pier borgherini     like ridolfo ghirlandajo  francia bigio fell off in his later style   partly because his ambition failed him  and also because he began to  look on art as a means of livelihood  a motive which is certain death to  high art     he was especially celebrated as a portrait painter  several of his works  having been attributed to raphael  among these are one at the louvre and  one at the pitti palace  both portraits of a youth in tunic and black  cap  with long hair flowing over his shoulders  one in the national  gallery  formerly in mr  fuller maitland s collection  the portrait of a  jeweller  dated a  s   mdxvi  in lord yarborough s gallery  that in the  berlin museum  of a man sitting at a desk  dated       and the likeness  of pier francesco de medici at windsor  all of which bear francia  bigio s monogram  often with the letters a  s    anno salutis   before  the date  he died on january   th                 chapter x     ridolfo ghirlandajo  a d                   ridolfo  di domenico  bigordi  called ghirlandajo   c   was born on the   th of january        although not strictly a scholar  he is one of  fra bartolommeo s principal followers  when quite a child he lost his  father  the famous domenico  who died of fever  on january   th         his mother and uncle benedetto only lived a few years after   and ridolfo  with his three sisters and two brothers  was left to the  guardianship of his uncle davide     ridolfo was the only one who chose the family profession  and he became  the fourth painter of the name of ghirlandajo     davide was not a perfect artist  although a good mosaicist  as his works  in the cathedrals of orvieto  siena  and florence show  but he was  for many years ridolfo s only instructor  as the boy grew up ridolfo  frequented those public schools of art before spoken of  the brancacci  chapel  and the study of the cartoons in the papal hall  here he secured  the friendship not only of granacci and pier di cosimo  but of raphael  himself  with whom he visited fra bartolommeo in his convent     raphael permitted ridolfo to assist him in a madonna for siena  and  tried to persuade him to accompany him to rome  but ridolfo  like a true  florentine  declined to go  beyond sight of the duomo      his first great picture was done in      for the church of san gallo   the subject was  christ searing his cross   his uncle benedetto had  laboured on a similar picture  now in the louvre  but ridolfo s is a  great improvement on this  the composition is well balanced  full  of force and animation  the weeping figures of the maries and the  solicitude of s  veronica are very lifelike  although he has not  entirely abolished his uncle s coarseness in the scowling  low typed  men  the christ and the virgin are  on the contrary  so refined as to  induce the supposition that this force of contrast was intentional  the  landscape is rather hard and crude in tone  the flesh tints smooth  and  the handling similar to that of credi     the original is now in palazzo antinori  florence  but a replica  in  which he was assisted by michele  his favourite pupil and adopted son   is in santo spirito     vasari speaks of a  nativity   painted for the cistercian monks of  cestello  a beautiful composition  in which the madonna adores the holy  child  s  joseph standing near her  s  francis and s  jerome kneel in  adoration  the landscape was sketched from the hills near  la vernia    where s  francis received the stigmata     maselli says the picture was lost when the monastery changed hands  but  messrs  crowe and cavalcaselle  footnote  history of fainting  vol  in   chap  xvi  pp             believe they have found it in the hermitage at  s  petersburg  under granacci s name  it is possible that the favourite  pupil of his father and ridolfo s own friend may have assisted him  the  landscape is raphaelesque  and might mark the time when that master  and fra bartolommeo influenced his style  his best manner approached so  nearly to that of the frate  that had he continued he would have very  nearly rivalled his excellence     his two masterpieces are now in the uffizi  they were painted for  the brotherhood of s  zenobio        to stand one on each side of  albertinelli s  annunciation   one is  s  zenobio   the first bishop and  patron saint of florence   restoring a dead child to life   the other  the  funeral procession of the saint passing the baptistery   where an  elm tree  which had been withered  put forth fresh leaves as the coffin  of the bishop touched it  a marble column  with a bronze tree in relief  on it  stands on the spot as a memorial of this miracle  in these two  works ridolfo ghirlandajo proved the power which was in him  but they  are the culmination of his art  he never surpassed  or indeed equalled  them again  his richness of colouring and deep relief equalled that of  the frate  the animation and expression rivalled andrea del sarto  in  the first picture  the eagerness of the crowd  the intense feeling of  the mother  in whom grief for the dead child seems almost greater  than the hope of his resuscitation  the sturdy  solid character of the  florentines of the republic  are all given with a masterly hand  while a  rich blending of colour fuses the animated crowd in a harmonious unison   in the latter  grandeur and dignity mark the group of ecclesiastics  which surrounds the archbishop s bier  the full solid falls of their  drapery show that he had well studied his father s works     ridolfo s brothers became monks  don bartolommeo lived in the  camaldoline monastery of the angeli  which ridolfo beautified with many  works  paolo uccelli had adorned the loggia with frescoed stories from  the life of s  benedict  ridolfo added two to the series  in one the  saint is at table with two angels  waiting for s  romano to send his  bread from the grotto  but the devil has cut the cord and taken it     another is  s  benedict investing a youth with the habit of the order    in the church of the same monastery he painted a beautiful  madonna and  child  with angels   above the holy water vase  and  s  romualdo with  the camaldolese hermitage in his hand   in a lunette in the cloister   all these were done as a brotherly gift  and after they were finished   the abbot  don andrea dossi  gave him a commission to paint a  last  supper  in the refectory  which he did  placing the portrait of the  abbot in the corner     ridolfo  like his father  regarded art rather as a means of livelihood  than with any aesthetic feelings  and this is probably the reason of his  never attaining true excellence  his  bottega  was really a shop where  any one might order a work of art  or of artisanship  and he gave as  much attention to painting a banner for a procession as to composing an  altar piece  he had a great many assistants  whom he called on for help  in various undertakings  they assisted him to prepare the medici  halls for the reception of pope leo x   and later for the marriages  of giuliano and lorenzo  not disdaining to paint scenes for the dramas  which were then given  he painted banners  and designed costumes for the  processions of the  potenze   a festive company  the origin of which is  uncertain  but dating certainly from the middle ages  each quarter of  the city had an emperor  lords  and dignitaries  each of whom carried  his banner or emblazonment  grand processions  tournaments  and feasts  were held once a year  on s  john s day  by the potenze     having assisted at the triumphs and marriages of the medici princes  he  also furnished the funeral pomp and magnificence on the deaths of the  brothers  that of giuliano occurring in       of lorenzo          lucratively it answered his purpose  the medici gave him great honour   he was well paid by them  and got the commission to decorate the chapel  of the palazzo vecchio  a very good specimen of his fresco painting  in  which he never reached his father s excellence  although in oil he far  surpassed him  the chapel is small  the groined roof is covered with  emblematical designs on a blue ground  a trinity in the midst with  angels bearing symbols of the passions around  the apostles and  evangelists surround this  and the principal wall has a larger fresco of  the  annunciation   a rather conventional rendering     commissions flowed in on him to such a degree  that although he  had fifteen children  he lived to amass money and lands  to see his  daughters well married  and his sons prosperous merchants trading to  distant lands  he died on the  th of june        and lies with his  forefathers in the church of s  maria novella           andrea d agnolo     called andrea del sarto           chapter i     youth and early works  a d                  andrea del sarto is a curious instance of the vital power of art  which   like a flower forcing its way to the light through walls or rocks  will  find expression in spite of obstacles     andrea the painter   senza errori   was an artist in spite of lowering  home influences  of want of encouragement in his patrons  for his  greatest works only brought the smallest remuneration  and even in  spite of his own nature  which was material  wanting in high aims  and  deficient in ideality  yet his name lives for ever as a great master   and his works rank close to those of the leaders of the renaissance     in looking at them one sighs even in the midst of admiration  thinking  that if the hand which produced them had been guided by a spark of  divine genius instead of the finest talent  what glorious works they  would have been  the truth is that andrea s was a receptive  rather  than an original and productive mind  his art was more imitative than  spontaneous  and this forms perhaps the difference between talent and  genius  the art of his time sunk into his mind  and was reproduced   he lived precisely at the time of the culmination of art  when all the  highest masters were bringing forth their grandest works  therefore he  could not do otherwise than to follow the best examples     he gathered the experience of all  the force of michelangelo  the  handling of leonardo  the sentiment of raphael  so blending them as to  form a style seemingly his own  and in execution following closely on  their excellence     in giotto s or masaccio s case the master created the art  in andrea s  it was the art of the age which made the artist     the question of andrea del sarto s birth is a mooted one  biadi dates  it       but the register he quotes is both vague and doubtful  he  also tells a curious story of his flemish origin  signor milanesi has  deduced  from the archives of florence  an authentic pedigree from which  we learn that his remote ancestors were peasants  first at buiano   near fiesole  and later at s  ilario  near montereggi  his grandfather   francesco  being a linen weaver  came to live nearer florence  his  father  agnolo  son of francesco  followed the trade of a tailor  hence  andrea s sobriquet   del sarto   he took a house in via gualfonda  in  florence  about       with his wife constanza  and here andrea was born   he being the eldest of a family of five  three girls and two boys  from  the tax papers of a few years later it is proved that andrea was born  in       his full name is andrea d agnolo di francesco  it is by mistake  that he has been called vannucchi     his parents were young  his father being only twenty seven years of  age at andrea s birth  they lived at that time in val fonda  where  albertinelli had his shop  but in      they removed to the popolo  or  parish  of s  paolo  boys were not allowed to be idle in those days  but  were apprenticed at an early age  thus andrea  like most artists of his  time  was bound to a goldsmith  it would be interesting to investigate  the great influence of the guild of goldsmiths on the art of the  renaissance  the reason why youths who showed a talent for design were  entered in that guild is easy to assign  it was one of the  greater   guilds  that of the painters being a lesser one  and merged in the  arte  degli speziali   at seven years old he left the school where he had  learned to read and write  and entered his very youthful apprenticeship   but he showed so much more aptitude for the designing than for the  executive part of his profession that  giovanni barile   who frequented  the bottega  was induced to counsel his being trained especially as  a painter  offering himself as instructor  if andrea  a contadino by  birth  an artisan by education  was not originally of the most refined  nature  his artistic training did not go far towards refining him   giovanni barile was a coarse painter and a rough man  he had  however   generosity enough to see that the boy was worthy of better teaching  and  got him entered in the bottega of piero di cosimo  who had attained  a good rank as a colourist  his eccentricities possibly adding to his  reputation     accordingly in       andrea being then eleven years of age  a life of  earnest study began  piero di cosimo  odd and misanthropic as he was   had yet a true appreciation of talent  and showed an earnest interest  in his pupil  giving him  with plenty of queer treatment  a thorough  training   he was not allowed to make a line which was not perfect    footnote  rosini   storia della pittura   chap  xvii  p       while  in piero s school  but excellent as his art teaching may have been  the  boy s morale could not have been raised more here than under the rough  but good natured barile  we have seen piero di cosimo in his youth  the  serious  absent young man  who never joked with his juniors in cosimo  roselli s shop  we see him now  with his youthful oddities hardened into  eccentricities  and his reserve deepened to misanthropy  no woman s hand  softened and refined his house  no cleansing broom was allowed within  his door  and no gardener s hand cleared the weeds or pruned the vines  in his garden  he so believed in nature unassisted that he took his  meals without the intervention of a cook  when the fire was lighted to  boil his size or glue he would cook fifty or sixty eggs and set them  apart in a basket  to which he had recourse when the pangs of hunger  compelled him  all this was morally very bad for a boy so young  and  then woe betide the poor little fellow if he whistled  sneezed  or made  any other noise  his nervous master would be out of temper for a day  afterwards  on wet days piero was merrier  for he would watch the drops  splashing into the pools  and laugh as if they were fairies  sometimes  he would take andrea for a walk  and all at once stop and gaze at a heap  of rubbish  or mark of damp on a lichened wall  picturing all kinds of  monsters and weird scenes in its discolourations     no doubt he was literally carrying out leonardo da vinci s advice   headed  in his treatise   a new art of invention    look at some old  wall covered with dirt  or the odd appearance of some old streaked  stones  you may discover several things like landscapes  battles   clouds  humorous faces   c   to furnish the mind with new designs     footnote  leonardo da vinci   treatise on painting    cosimo s mind  being fantastic  the pictures he saw were incomparably grotesque  he  delighted in drawing sea monsters  dragons  wonderful adventures  and  heathen scenes  in fact the boy could have learned neither christian  art nor manners from him  he learned how to use his brush  however  and   leaving piero to his minotaurs and dragons  went off at every spare hour  to study at more congenial shrines  he copied masaccio at the brancacci  chapel  and drew so earnestly from the cartoons in the hall of the pope  that his achievements reached the ears of piero himself  who was not  sorry that his pupil surpassed the rest  and gave him more time for  study away from the bottega  rosini tells us that  fra bartolommeo  taught him the first steps    footnote   storia della pittura   chap   xxvii  p      the influence of the frate may have reached him in two  ways  it is not unlikely that piero di cosimo kept up an interest in his  old fellow pupil  and then again  as andrea lived in val fonda  it is  probable he often visited albertinelli s studio in that street  and the  friendship with francia bigio began before the cartoons of michelangelo  ripened there     the evidence of style goes to show that the works of albertinelli and  fra bartolommeo influenced him more than those of piero  yet though  his sphere was devotional  it was  impelled more by a material sense of  beauty than by the deep religious feeling which inspired the frate      as time went on the youth in strange old piero s studio became more  famous than his master  and felt that he could do greater things away  from the stiff method which cramped him  and the whimsicalities which  annoyed him  his friend  francia bigio  mariotto s pupil  having  just then lost his master  who was giving more attention to his  father in law s business of innkeeper than his own  was willing to enter  into partnership  and the two youths began life together in      or        in a room near the piazza del grano  in the first house in via del  moro  which still remains in its old state     the first bit of patronage recorded is the commission for the frescoes  in the scalzo  that they had work before is proved by the words in  the contract of the barefoot friars   dettero ad andrea pittore   celeberrimo  il dipingere nel chiosto   the  celebrated  presupposes  works already done     the scalzo was a name given to the  compagnia dei disciplinati di s   giovanni battista   because they went barefoot when they carried the  cross in their processions  they lived in a convent in via larga  now  cavour   opposite san marco  a new cloister had been erected there  an  elegant little cortile  thirty eight feet by thirty two  adorned with  lovely corinthian pillars  and the brethren were anxious to fill the  lunettes of the arches with frescoes at the least possible expense   wisely judging that a young artist on his way to fame would be the best  to employ     the frescoes  of which there would be twelve large  and four small ones  in the upright spaces by the doors  were to be done in  terretta   or  brown earth  and to be paid fifty six lire  eight scudi  for the large   and twenty one lire  three scudi  each for the lesser frescoes  the  small ones were four figures of the virtues   faith    hope    justice    and  charity    hope  is exquisitely expressed  and  charity  a charming  group  the children most tenderly drawn  the subjects  though not all  finished till many years later  stand now in the following order  the  second row of figures  with the dates  show the order in which they were  painted           gabriel appearing to zacharias          andrea del sarto                 visitation                              andrea del sarto                 birth of s  john

    herodias receives the head of s  john   andrea del sarto            of these  no    was the first executed  and it is probable that francia  bigio assisted him  for it has not the finished drawing nor careful  handling of any of andrea s other frescoes  possibly this is the cause  of the partners never working together afterwards  each taking his own  subjects and signing his own name  the composition  in the  baptism of  christ   is not original  being very similar to that of verocchio s   especially in the two angels kneeling on the left bank  the landscape  and figures  however  are far in advance of that master     it will be well to speak of the whole set of frescoes in this place  for  although they belong to different times and styles  they are a complete  work  and might be taken almost as an epitome of andrea s career   from the one above mentioned in which piero de cosimo s influence is  apparent  to the nos    and    which very nearly approach michelangelo s  power and freedom     in no    the expression of muteness about the mouth of zacharias  as he  stands by the altar  is wonderfully given  you feel sure he could not  speak if he would  the other figures are superfluous to the motive   though adding grandeur to the work as a whole     in composition andrea differs widely from fra bartolommeo  the latter  delighted in building up a single form  every figure in the whole  picture adding its hue and weight to perfect this pyramid or circle   andrea spreads his figures more widely  he likes a double composition   dividing his pictures into two separate groups  connected by one central  figure  or divided entirely  this is seen in nos        and     which  are all double groupings  the last completely divided in the centre by a  table and an archway behind it  nos    and   are pyramidal compositions   the  preaching of s  john  is one of the best works  and shows his most  forcible style  s  john on a rock stands like a pillar in the centre   the hearers are dressed in the  lucco   a florentine cloak of the   th  century   the grouping following the lines of the landscape  at the  back jesus kneels on a rising ground  vasari says the figures are from  albrecht duerer  whose works had made a great impression on the southern  world of art  but it is more probable that they only show his influence   for the dress and style are florentine     no     the  baptism of the gentiles   is another of his best style   and is  in the drawing of the nude figures  almost michelangelesque  in power  this is one of his favourite  echo  subjects  a group in the  background of  john answering the pharisees  forming an echo to the  principal subject  the muscular life of the spirited crowd of nude  figures is beautifully contrasted by the graceful draped forms in the  background  one of the baptized is the same child whom he had modelled  in the  madonna  of s  francisco     nos    and   are by francia bigio  and were done during andrea s absence  in france  showing that he had so far learned from his friend as almost  to rival him in power  the subjects  although not scriptural  are  conjecturally true     in the  zacharias blessing john before he goes to the desert   the  sitting figure of s  elizabeth and the kneeling one of the child are  very lovely  the action of zacharias is not so well defined  the  great force in the uplifted arm betokens anger more than blessing  the  grouping follows the lines of a flight of steps in the background  and  is triangular     the same form of composition is apparent in the next group  no      only  the lines form an angle receding from the one just mentioned  the virgin  is charmingly posed and draped  the children less pleasing     this elegant little cloister is a true shrine of art  although the  frescoes are all in monochrome  so much were they admired at the time   that an order was issued prohibiting artists to copy them without the  permission of duke cosimo  cardinal carlo de  medici had them covered  with curtains   footnote  richa   delle chiese   but  in spite of care   they are very much injured  the under parts almost lost  the precaution  of covering the cloister with a glass roof has only been taken in modern  times  and too late     andrea s next patrons were the eremite monks of s  agostino  at san  gallo  who ordered of him two pictures for their church  in      he  painted  christ appearing to mary magdalen   and an  annunciation  in        the former is said to have had much softness and delicacy  the  latter is to be seen in the hall of mars at the pitti  and is a very  pleasing picture  the virgin kneels at her prayer desk  s  joseph behind  her  a rather unusual rendering of the subject  her attitude is graceful  and decorous  the angel calm and gentle  floats in mid air  two other  angels stand on the left  the colouring is varied in the extreme  and  the lights well defined     these two pictures  and the  disputa   painted later  were removed to  the church of s  jacopo tra fossi  when the convent was demolished in        they were still there in       when bocchi wrote his  bellezze di  firenze   but the  christ appearing to mary magdalen  is said to be now  in the church of the covoni in the casentino           chapter ii     the servite cloister  a d                  the next great works were the frescoes in the court of s  annunziata  if  indeed they were not carried on simultaneously with those in the scalzo   this famous series of andrea s works was obtained by cunning  and  painted in emulation  while the two partners  who had differed from the  beginning  and had since become rivals  were engaged in the scalzo  a  certain astute fra mariano  the keeper of the wax candle stores at the  servite convent  to which the church of the s  annunziata belonged  had  watched well those two young painters  fra mariano understood human  nature  as priests often do  he had seen the envious rivalship growing  between them  as the friends  who should have worked together  took  separate compartments  and cast jealous criticising glances on each  other s designs and method of work  having ambition of his own  he knew  how to work on that of others to further his own aspirations  which  were  to be considered a patron of art and a benefactor to his convent     reading andrea s heart  he played on all his strongest feelings  placed  before him the glory he would win by covering the lunettes of the arches  in the court of the fine church with frescoes which would carry his  name down to posterity  he said that any other artist would pay much  to obtain leave to paint upon historical walls like those  and how they  would all envy the man who should obtain the coveted honour  then  with  a half whispered hint that for one  francia bigio was dying to get the  commission for nothing  the wily frate went his way victorious  andrea   scorning to make any pecuniary bargain  only stipulated that no one else  should paint in that courtyard  and forthwith began the  stories from  the life of s  filippo benizzi   having only old alesso baldovinetti s   nativity   and cosimo roselli s  miracle of s  filippo   as foils to  his own  these two works were on the walls on each side of the church  door  there were therefore three entire sides of the cloister to cover   excepting only the entrance into the courtyard from the piazza  and  no doubt he felt like ghirlandajo  when  he wished he had the entire  circuit of the city walls to paint      on the   th of june        he began to paint with such vigour that in a  few months the first three were uncovered         s  philip at viterbo with the court  dressing a naked leper in his  own cloak          s  philip going from bologna to modena   he rebukes some gamblers   telling them the vengeance of god is near  a sudden thunderstorm and  lightning destroy them  thus fulfilling the prediction  there is a  great deal of fine action in this composition  the horror and disbelief  struggling in the faces of the men  and the stormy landscape are all  well rendered  a horse leaps away with strong  terrified action  there  is a masterly grasp of his vivid subject  and a rugged strength in the  execution which gives great life to it         s  philip exorcises a girl possessed of a demon   here the  composition is very tender  the mother and father support the sick girl   and form a very pleasing group  the figures of the spectators are full  of life without exaggeration     these works have suffered much from exposure  but the colouring is still  good  the praise that andrea obtained for them was so great that he  followed them up by the two in the next series         a child brought to life by touching the bier of s  philip   this is  a kind of double composition  the child being represented in a twofold  condition in the foreground  first as dead  and then revived at the  touch of the bier  the grouping around the dead saint is very suggestive  of ghirlandajo  and shews a deep study of his frescoes in the sassetti  chapel  the colouring is peculiarly his own  there is the mingling of  a great variety of bright tints of equal intensity  which by some  necromancy are made to relieve each other  instead of being relieved by  the art of chiaroscuro as in the handling of other masters         children healed by the garments of s  philip   which are held by a  priest  standing before an altar  the women and their children kneeling  in front of him  the grouping is symmetrical  the figures lifelike  but  not refined  round cheeked buxom women  and rough  human men s faces   bespeak andrea as the painter of reality rather than ideality  there is  vivid life in every attitude  but the life is not high caste  a fine old  man  leaning on his staff  is a portrait of andrea della robbia  whose  son luca stands near     for all these fra mariano paid only ten scudi each  and andrea  feeling  the remuneration not equal to the merit of the work  would have left off  here  but the frate held him to his bond  two more lunettes yet remained  to finish  but as these were of a later date  we will reserve them for  a future chapter  he also painted in the  orto   or garden  of the  convent  the now perished fresco of the  parable of the vineyard      meanwhile  the rival friends had changed lodgings  they left the piazza  del grano  and took rooms in the sapienza  a street between the piazza  san marco and the s  annunziata  andrea chose this because it was near  his work  and also because his great friends  sansovino and rustici   already lived there  commissions began to pour in on him  which he  fulfilled  while still at work at the servi  judging from the style of  his early manner  we may date at this time a  virgin and child  with  s  john and s  joseph   now in the pitti  it is painted  alla prima     i e   a quick method of giving the effect in the first painting   and  is probably the one spoken of by vasari as painted for andrea santini   it formerly belonged to francesco troschi   footnote   life of andrea  del sarto   vol iii  p           a  s  agnes   in the palace of the prince palatine  at duesseldorf  is  in this early style  he also painted some frescoes at san salvi   ss   giovanni gualberto and benedict resting on clouds   they ornamented the  recess where the  last supper  was placed at a later period     in a narrow alley  behind the church of or san michele  is a tabernacle  on the wall beneath an ancient balcony  here the architect  baccio  d agnolo  commissioned andrea del sarto to paint an  annunciation   it  is so much injured as to be almost indistinguishable now  but was much  admired at the time  though some say it was too laboured  and so wanting  in ease and grace   footnote  biadi      vasari  vol  iii  p       it  is more likely that it was one of his early works  and should be classed  before the frescoes of the scalzo  for it is said that he was living at  the time with his father  whose shop was over the archway  and that  he had adorned the inner walls of the house with two frescoed angels    footnote   firenze antica e moderna  ed  flor        vol  vi  p         these have perished completely           chapter iii     social life and marriage  a d                  this chapter will speak of the  man   and not of the  artist   as it is  now understood that history is not a dry record of battles and laws  but  the story of the inner life of a people  so the biography of a painter  ought not to consist wholly in a list and description of his works  but  a picture of his life and inner mind  that we may know the character  which prompted the works     first  as to personal appearance  there are two portraits of andrea  del sarto in his youth  one in the duke of northumberland s collection  represents him as a young man with long hair  and a black cap  writing  at a table  it is painted in a soft  harmonious style  but not masterly  as regards chiaroscuro  it might be by francia bigio  as it has  something of the manner of his master  albertinelli     another now in the uffizi is a most life like portrait of sombre  colouring  but not highly finished  here we have the same black cap and  long hair  the dress is a painter s blouse of a blue grey  which well  brings out the flesh tints  the face is intelligent  but not refined   the clear dark eyes bespeak the artist spirit  but the full mobile mouth  tells the material nature of the man  in looking at this one can solve  the riddle of the dissonance between his art and his life  as a young  man andrea was full of spirit  he loved lively society  and knew almost  all the young artists who lived very much as students now  they met each  other in the art schools  and dined and feasted together in the wine  shops  sometimes they formed private clubs  meeting in certain rooms for  purposes of youthful merriment     of this kind was the  society of the cauldron    societa del paiuolo     held at the apartment of the eccentric sculptor  rustici  which was in  the same street as that of andrea himself     sansovino  who also lived near  was not a member of this rollicking  club  he was one of andrea s more serious friends  and served as  companion when his most exalted moods were upon him  perhaps rustici s  rooms did not please sansovino  for strange inmates were there  a  hedgehog  an eagle  a talking raven  snakes and reptiles  in a kind  of aquarium  besides all these gruesome familiar spirits  rustici was  addicted to necromancy  the society of the cauldron seems only a natural  outgrowth from such a character  it consisted of twelve members  all  artists  goldsmiths  or musicians  each of whom was allowed to bring  four friends to the supper  and bound to provide a dish  any two members  bringing similar dishes were fined  but the droll part of it was that  the suppers were eaten in a huge cauldron large enough to put table and  chairs into  the handle served as an arched chandelier  the table was  on a lift  and when one course was finished it disappeared from their  midst  and descended to be replenished  as for the viands  the sculptors  displayed their talents in moulding classical subjects in pastry  and  turning boiled fowls into figures of ulysses and laertes  the architects  built up temples and palaces of jellies  cakes  and sausages  the  goldsmith  robetta  produced an anvil and accoutrements made of a  calf s head  the painters treated roast pig to represent a scullery maid  spinning     andrea del sarto built up the model of the baptistery with all kinds of  eatables  with a reading desk of veal  and book with letters inlaid with  truffles  at which the choristers were roast thrushes with open beaks   while the canons were pigeons in red mantles of beetroot  an idea more  droll than reverential     after this  in       another club  called that of the  trowel   was  instituted  of which andrea was not a member  but was chosen as an  associate  the first supper was arranged by giuliano bugiardini  and was  held on the  aja  or threshing floor of s  maria nuova  where the bronze  gates of the baptistery had been cast     in this no two members were allowed to wear the same style of dress  under penalty of a fine  the members were in two ranks  the  lesser  and  the  greater   a parody on the guilds of the city  they were shown the  plan of a building  and the  greater  members  furnished with trowels   were obliged to build it in edibles  the  lesser  acting as hodmen  and  bringing materials  pails of ricotta or goat s milk cheese served for  mortar  grated cheese for sand  sugar plums for gravel  cakes and pastry  for bricks  the basement was of meats  the pillars fowls or sausages     some suppers were classical scenes  others allegorical representations   always in the same edible form  we can imagine the wit which sparkled  round these strange tables  the jokes of the artists  the songs of the  musicians  andrea del sarto is said to have recited an heroi comic poem  in six cantos called the  battle of the frogs and mice   biadi gives it  entire  it seems a kind of satire on rustici s tastes  with perhaps  a hit at the government  and shows no lack of wit of rather unrefined  style  but the authorship is not proved  some say ottaviano de medici  assisted andrea in it     it would have been well for andrea if this innocent jollity had sufficed  for him  but unfortunately he admired a woman whose beauty was greater  than her merits  probably he began by mere artistic appreciation of her  personal charms  for she sat to him for the  madonna of the visitation    which was painted in       two years before their marriage  this  lucrezia della fede was the wife of a hatter who lived in via san gallo   her husband dying after a short illness  andrea del sarto married her   and whatever were her faults  she retained his life long love  biadi and  reumont give the date   th of december        as that of the death of  her husband  but signor milanesi  from more authentic sources  proves it  to have been in          a great deal has been said and written of the evil influence this woman  had on him  and his very house bears an inscription recording his fame  together with  affanni domestici   but it would seem that posterity  has taken for truth more than the facts of the time imply  that she was  proud  haughty  exacting  and not of a high moral nature  that she was  selfish  and begrudged his helping his own family  her every action  proves  that her manners were not conciliating to the pupils is  possible  perhaps their manners savoured too much of familiarity for a  woman who believed in her own charms  but that she was faithless  which  her biographers assert on the strength of vasari s phrase   that andrea  was tormented by jealousy   there is literally nothing to show     in the first place vasari  who was one of the scholars she offended and  put down  gives vent to his private pique in his first edition  and in  the second  which only contains a slight mention of her  omits almost  all he had previously said  now  if the first assertions were true why  should he retract them  secondly  the sixteenth century was an age of  license in writing and speaking  and had any immoralities been laid to  her charge  not a biographer would have scrupled to particularize them   but no  her name is never mentioned  except with her husband s  even by  her greatest enemies  who say she was as haughty as she was beautiful   thirdly  a faithless woman could never have kept her husband s devoted  love  and had she been so  would that affectionate though exaggerated  letter of hers  recalling him from france  have been written  that a  man who thinks his wife the most lovely creature living may be tormented  with jealousy without wrong doing on her part is more than possible     let us then place lucrezia s character where it ought to stand in andrea  del sarto s life  as a powerful influence  lowering his moral nature   weaning him from his duties as a son and brother  by fixing all his care  and affection on herself  she  however  not allowing her own family to  be losers by her marriage  although causing him to slight his own  even  this much spoken of neglect of his own family seems disproved by his  will  which  after a very little more than her own dot left to his wife   makes his brother and niece heirs of all his estate     except that she cared more for her own pleasure than his true  advancement  she was not any great hindrance to his artistic career  he  painted an incredible number of pictures  and she was willing to sit  for him over and over again  indeed if she were his model for all the  madonnas in which her features are recognisable  she must have had  either inexhaustible patience or great love for the artist     in fact she was thoroughly selfish  as long as she reaped the benefit  of his work she furthered his art  where she was left out of his  consideration he must be brought back to her side at any sacrifice to  him  this is not the stuff of which an artist s wife ought to be made   the influence of a strong willed selfish nature on his weak and material  one was not good  and his  morale  became lowered     he felt this deterioration less than his friends felt it for him  even  vasari says that  though he lived in torment  he yet accounted it a high  pleasure   it was one of those unions in which the man gives everything   and the woman receives and allows every sacrifice  her family were kept  at his expense  her daughter loved as his own  and if she were haughty  or exacting  he suffered with a socratic patience  thinking life with  her a privilege     it is to be supposed that a member of the societies of the cauldron  and the trowel would appreciate good living  he was so devoted to  the pleasures of the table that he went to market himself early every  morning and came home laden with delicacies   footnote  biadi   notixie  inedite    c   chap  xix  p       a curious confirmation of this is to  be found in his house  the dining room of which is beautifully frescoed   the arched roof in raphaelesque scrolls and grotesques  while the  lunettes of one wall have two large pictures  one of a woman roasting  birds over a fire  the other of a servant preparing the table for  dinner  this love of good living  however  in the end shortened his  life  according to biadi     after his marketing was over he turned his attention to art  going to  his fresco painting followed by his scholars  or superintending their  work in the  bottega   he was always a kind and thorough master  his  manner just and fatherly     sometimes he and sansovino or other friends lounged away an hour in the  neighbouring shop of nanni unghero  where their mutual friend  niccolo  tribolo  did all the hard work  fetching and carrying blocks and saws  grumblingly  tribolo often begged sansovino to take him as his pupil   which he did afterwards  and he became a famous sculptor  one of  andrea s acquaintances was baccio bandinelli  who  as he thought he  could equal michelangelo in sculpture  imagined that only a knowledge  of andrea del sarto s method of colouring was necessary to enable him  to surpass him in painting  to gain this knowledge he proposed to sit to  andrea for his portrait  his friend  discovering his motive  succeeded  in frustrating it by mixing a quantity of colours in seeming confusion  on his palette  and yet getting from this chaos exactly the tints he  required  so baccio never rivalled his friend in colouring after all   not being able to understand his method           chapter iv     works in florence  a d                  from      to      andrea was employed on the two last frescoes in the  courtyard of the ss  annunziata the  epiphany  and the  nativity of the  virgin   the sum fixed for these was ninety eight lire  but the servite  brothers augmented it by forty two lire more  seeing the work was   veramente maravigliosa   thus these two were paid at the same rate as  the other five of s  filippo  seventy lire or ten scudi each     in the  nativity   one of the finest of his frescoes  we see his  favourite double grouping  the interest in the mother being kept to one  side  that of the child and its attendants to the other a balance of  form united by joachim  a stern  finely moulded figure in the centre   the attitudes are natural  the draperies free and graceful  old vasari  justly remarks  pajono di carne le figure   the woman standing in the  centre of the room is lucrezia della fede  this is the first known  likeness of her  there is a richness of colour without impasto  a  modulation of shade giving full relief without startling contrast  a  clear air below and celestial haze in the angel peopled clouds above     this might well be classed as on the highest level ever reached in  fresco  nearly fifty years after it was painted  while jacopo d empoli  was copying this fresco  an old woman came through the courtyard to  mass  and  stopping to watch the young artist at his work  began to talk  of the days of her youth and beauty when she sat for the likeness of  that natural figure in the midst  no doubt sighing as she looked at  the freshness of the fresco  and thought of her many wrinkles and aged  limbs  she being nearly fourscore at the time     the  epiphany  is also a remarkable work  more lively than the last   it is also less carefully painted  the graceful feminine element  is wanting  there is plenty of activity  a crowded composition   and richness of colour  three figures are especially interesting as  likenesses  that of the musician francesco ajolle  a great composer of  madrigals  who went to france in       and spent the remainder of his  life there  sansovino  on the right of ajolle  and near him andrea  himself  the same face as the portrait in the uffizi already spoken of     the  madonna del sacco   over the door of the entrance to the church  from the cloister  would seem to have been painted in the same year         judging from biadi s extract from the ms  account books of the  servite fathers existing in the archives  where is an entry  giugno         ad andrea del sarto  per resto della madonna del sacco  lire       this term  resto   remainder  would imply a previous payment  the money  was a thank offering from a woman for having been absolved from a vow by  one of the servite priests  like all his other frescoes of this church   andrea only gained ten scudi for this masterpiece  the date of mdxxv   and the words  quem genuit adoravit  on the pilasters of this work have  led most writers to suppose it painted in that year  but it is probable  they were added by a later hand  biadi  footnote  biadi   notizie    c    p     note   says the letters are of the style of nearly two centuries  later  that andrea would have signed it  like all his other and works   with his monogram of the crossed a s  i e  andrea d  agnolo   for  charming soft harmonies of colour  simplicity  and grace of design  this  surpasses all his other frescoes  the madonna has an imposing grandeur  of form  there is a boyish strength and moulding in the limbs of the  child which is very expressive  the dignity of joseph and majesty of the  virgin are not to be surpassed  and yet the whole is given in a space so  cramped that all the figures have to be reclining or sitting      illustration of monogram     after this andrea returned to the scalzo  the barefoot brothers offering  better pay than the servites  here he did the allegory of  justice   and the  sermon of s  john  in monochrome  in these he took a fancy to  retrograde his style  for they have the rugged force and angular form  that recalls the more stern old italian masters  or that titan of  northern art  albrecht duerer     of his works in oil at this era we may class         the  story of joseph   painted for zanobi girolami bracci  which  borghini judges a beautiful picture  the figures were small  but the  painting highly finished  it came afterwards into the possession of the  medici family        a  madonna   with decorations and models surrounding it like a frame   was painted for sansovino s patron  giovanni gaddi  afterwards clerk  of the chamber to ferdinand i  it was existing in the collection of the  gaddi pozzi family in borghini s time         annunciation   for giovanni di paolo merciajo  now in the hall  of saturn in the pitti palace  it is a pretty composition  the virgin  sitting  yet half kneeling  the angel on his knees before her  there is  a yellowish light in the sky between two looped dark green curtains  the  angel s yellow robe takes the light beautifully         madonna and child   in the  hall of the education of jupiter  in the  pitti palace  one of his most pleasing groups  this is supposed by the  commentators of vasari to be the altarpiece painted for giovanni di  paolo merciajo  but biadi traces it through the possession of antonio   son of zanobi bracci  to its present possessors  the mistake arises  from vasari often confusing the names annunciations and assumptions with  madonnas        a  holy family   for andrea santini  which awakened great admiration  in florence  it was in the possession of signer alessandro curti lepri   by whose permission morghen s print was taken        the  head of our saviour   over the altar of the ss  annunziata   ordered by the sacristan of the order  a magnificent head  full of  grandeur and expression  and very clear in the flesh tints  empoli made  several copies of it        the  madonna di san francesco   andrea s masterpiece among easel  pictures  it was a commission from a monk of the order of  minorites of  santa croce   who was intendant of the nuns of s  francesco  and  advised them to employ andrea  in grandiose simplicity this surpasses  albertinelli s  visitation   in soft gradations and rich mellowness  of colour it equals fra bartolommeo at his best  for tenderness in the  attitude of the child it is quite raphaelesque  the madonna is standing  on a pedestal adorned with sculptured harpies  she holds the divine  child in one arm  its little hands are twined tenderly round her neck   and it seems to be climbing closer to her  the two children at her feet  give a suggestive triangular grouping  while the dignified figures of s   francis and s  john the evangelist form supports on each side  and  rear up a pyramid of beauty  rosini s term  soave  just expresses this  picture  so fused and soft  rich yet transparent in the colouring  the  olive brown robe of one saint is balanced by the rich red of the other   in the virgin  a deep blue and mellow orange are combined by a crimson  bodice  the price paid to the painter for this was low because he asked  little  but a century or two later  ferdinando de  medici  son of cosmo  iii   spent        scudi to restore the church  and had a copy of the  picture made in return for a gift of the original  which is now the gem  of the tribune in the uffizi        the  disputa  di s  agostino  is another masterpiece  showing as much  power as the last named work displays of softness  it was painted at the  order of the eremite monks of san gallo for their church of san jacopo  tra fossi  where it was injured by a flood in       and removed later  to the hall of saturn in the pitti palace  the composition is level  the  four disputing saints standing in a row  the two listeners  s  sebastian  and mary magdalen  kneeling in front  s agostino  with fierce vehemence   expounds the mystery of the trinity  s  stephen turns to s  francesco  interrogatively  s  domenico  whom vasari  by the way  calls s  peter  martyr  has a face full of silent eloquence  he seems only waiting his  turn to speak  in s  sebastian we have a good study from the nude  and  in mary magdalen s kneeling figure  a charming portrait of lucrezia  is  concentrated the principal focus of colour         four saints   ss  gio  battista  gio  gualberto  s  michele  and  bernardo cardinale  a beautifully painted picture  once in the hermitage  of vallombrosa  there were originally two little angels in the midst  dividing the saints  as in our illustration  when the picture was  transferred to the gallery of the belle arti  where it now is  the  angels were taken out and the divided saints brought into a more compact  group  the angels are in a frame between two frescoed madonnas of fra  bartolommeo     by this time the fame of andrea del sarto  both as a fresco and oil  painter  had risen to the highest point  michelangelo only echoed the  opinion of others when he said to raphael   there is a little fellow in  florence who will bring the sweat to your brow if ever he is engaged in  great works   his style of composition was important  his figures varied  and life like  his draperies dignified   the main excellence  however   in which andrea stands unique among his contemporaries rests in the  incomparable blending of colour  in the soft flesh tints  in the  exquisite chiaroscuro  in the transparent clearness even of his  deepest shadows  and in his entirely new manner of perfect modelling     footnote   luebke history of art   vol  ii  p        his method  as  shown in an unfinished picture of the  adoration of the magi  in the  guadagni palace  was to paint on a light ground  the sketch was a  black outline  the features and details not defined  but often roughly  indicated  he finished first the sky and background  the flesh tints   draperies   c   were all true in tone from the first laying in    footnote  eastlake s  materials for history of oil fainting    he did  not place shades one over the other  and fuse them together glaze by  glaze as leonardo did  but used an opaque dead colouring which allowed  of correction  the system was rapid  but deficient in depth and  mellowness   the lights are fused and bright   but  the shadows  owing  to their viscous consistency  imperfectly fill the outlines    footnote   crowe and cavalcaselle  vol  in  chap  xvii  p        in a  holy family   in the louvre  s  elizabeth s hand is painted across s  john  and shows  the shadow underneath it  being grey at that part  though more solid   he could not paint light over dark without injuring his brilliance of  colour     albertinelli  on the contrary  when he painted and repainted his   annunciation   washed out the under layer with essential oil before  making his  pentimenti  or corrections  and in this way the thinness was  kept     in andrea s early style this thinness is apparent  especially in the  joseph series  painted for pier francesco borgherini     biadi classes andrea s works in three styles  the first showing the  influence of piero di cosimo  the second  to which the best works in the  servi cloisters belong  is a larger and more natural style  after the  study of michelangelo and leonardo     the third is the natural development in his own practice of a perfect  knowledge of art  and a just appreciation of nature  the  birth of  the baptist  and the  cenacolo   of san salvi  belong to his last and  greatest manner  in      the florentine artists were employed on more  perishable works than frescoes  leo x   the medici pope who had been  elected in       made his triumphal entry into florence on the  rd of  september        on his way to meet francis i  of france at bologna   all the guilds and ranks of florence vied with each other to make his  reception as artistic as possible  he and his suite were obliged to stay  three days in the villa gianfigliazzi at marignolle while the triumphal  preparations were being completed  the churches had temporary  facades   of splendid architecture in fresco  arches were erected at the porta  romana and piazza san felice  covered with historical paintings   giuliano del tasso adorned the ponte santa trinita with statues   antonio san gallo made a temple on the piazza della signoria  and  baccio bandinelli prepared a colossus in the loggia dei lanzi  various  decorations adorned other streets  and andrea del sarto surpassed them  all with a  facade  to the duomo  painted in monochrome on wood  his  friend sansovino designed the architecture  and he painted the sculpture  and adornments with such effect that the pope declared no work in marble  could have been finer     andrea lent his talent to another kind of decorative art  the guild  of merchants were desirous of inaugurating a festa for the day of s   giovanni  and had ten chariots made from the model of the ancient roman  ones  to institute chariot races in the piazza  andrea painted several  of these with historical subjects  but they have long been lost  the  chariot races were revived under the grand dukes  but not with any  success           chapter v     going to france  a d                  meanwhile fate was working andrea del sarto on to what might have been  the culminating point of his fame  had not his weakness rendered it  a blot on his honour  i e  his journey to france  his fame was rising  high  a picture of the  dead christ surrounded by angels   weeping over  the body they support  having been sent to france   footnote  it was  engraved by the venetian  agostino  before it went to france  the  engraving is signed       it did not please andrea  who never allowed  any others to be engraved   the king was so pleased with it that he  wished another work by the same artist  andrea painted a very beautiful   madonna   for which  however  he only obtained a quarter of the price  which the king paid to the merchants  the king was so delighted with it  that he sent the artist an invitation to come to paris in his employ   promising to pay all his expenses  in the pitti palace there is a  portrait of andrea and his wife  in which he has commemorated the  reception of this letter  he is looking very interested over it  while  his wife has the blankest expression possible     in the summer of      he started with his pupil  andrea sguazzella   called nanoccio  such a journey was in those days considered as little  less than a parting for life  it is plain that lucrezia s family  looked on her as almost a widow  for they made him sign a deed of  acknowledgement for the     florins of her  dote   some authors have  taken this document as a proof of their marriage in that year  but it  was merely a precaution against loss by her family  the italian law  being that the husband is obliged to render the portion obtained with  his wife to her family if she dies without issue  and in case of his own  death  the widow is entitled to it     he was well received in paris  and employed immediately on a likeness  of the infant dauphin henri ii   then only a few months old  for this he  obtained     scudi  and a monthly salary was allowed him  what a mine of  gold the french court must have seemed to him after working for years at  large frescoes for ten scudi each     he did no less than fifty works of art while there  most of which have  been engraved by the best french artists  footnote  see  catalogue of  royal pictures in france   by m  lepiscie   the  carita  is signed        and is in andrea s best style  perhaps with a leaning towards  michelangelo  the  s  jerome in penitence   which he painted for the  king s mother  and obtained a large price for  cannot be traced  his  life in paris was a new revelation  and not without its effect on his  character  always alive to substantial pleasure     the king and his courtiers frequented his atelier  and delighted to  watch him paint  vieing with each other in the richness of their gifts   among which were splendid brocade dresses and beautiful ornaments and  jewels  in which he longed to adorn his wife  while he was engaged in  painting the  s  jerome  for the queen mother  a letter from lucrezia  aroused his longings for home to the uttermost  she  the wife who has  been branded by the name of faithless  wrote that she was disconsolate  in his absence  and that if he did not soon return he would find her  dead with grief     vasari  quoting this exaggerated letter  says in his first edition that  she only wanted money to give her friends  but this also he retracts in  the second  whether it expressed her feelings truly or not  the letter  had such an effect on andrea s mind that he decided to return home at  any cost     during andrea s absence the house in via s  sebastiano  behind the  annunziata  was being prepared under her superintendence and with  his sanction  his scholars had decorated the walls and ceilings with  frescoes  and no doubt lucrezia was as anxious for him to see the new  house as he was to adorn her with parisian brocades and jewellery     being able to satisfy her ambitious soul  andrea too readily flung away  all his brilliant prospects to return  and willingly take again the yoke  of the burden of his wife and her family  he made promises that he would  bring her back to paris with him  and the king in all faith allowed  him to depart  confiding to him large sums of money for the purchase of  works of art to be sent to france     sguazzella  wiser than his master  preferred to stay in paris under the  patronage of cardinal de tournon  he painted a great many works  much in  the style of andrea  but with less excellence  it is possible that some  of m  lepiscie s long list are  in fact  the work of the pupil rather  than the master  when benvenuto cellini went to france in      he lodged  in sguazzella s house  with his three servants and three horses  at a  weekly rate of payment   a tanto la settimana       but to return to andrea  this is an episode in his life which we would  gladly pass over if it were possible  for it forms the moral blot on a  great artistic career     returning home he fell once more under the strong will of his wife  but  with his principles weakened by the effect of a luxury and prosperity  which has always a greater deteriorating effect on a nature such as  his than on a finer mind  bringing grand ideas from the palaces of the  french nobles  he not only fell in with lucrezia s plans for beautifying  the new house  but even surpassed her wildest schemes  the staircase was  embellished with rich oaken balustrades  the rooms were all frescoed   cupids hide in the raphaelesque scrolls on the arches  classic  divinities rest on the ceilings  but in the dining room the homely  nature of the man who did his own marketing  creeps out  it is a  charming room  the windows opening on a garden courtyard  where a vine  trellis leads round to what used to be the side door of his studio which  has its entrance in another street     the roof is vaulted and covered with exquisite decorative frescoes  but  in the lunettes of the two largest arches are the domestic scenes of  cooking and laying the cloth  spoken of at page     two or three of the  up stairs rooms are very fine  especially the one in which andrea is  said to have died   footnote  this description is due to the kindness of  the present resident in the house  who kindly showed it to the writer   pointing out all the unrestored portions   it is probable the furniture  matched the style of the rooms  and that much money was spent on  carved chairs and  cassoni   certain it is that the king of france s  commissions were unfulfilled  and his money misappropriated     andrea would have returned to france  but his wife  who had an italian  woman s dread of leaving her own country  put every obstacle in his way   adding entreaties to tears which the uxorious andrea could not resist   as usual he tried to please her  and she only cared to please herself     he fell greatly in the estimation of the king  who was justly angry   albeit the artist salved his own too easy conscience by sending a few  of his own paintings to francis i   one of which  the  sacrifice of  abraham   still remains in france  and another a half length figure of   s  john the baptist   the place of this picture is much disputed  it is  said to be at present in the pitti palace  argenville speaks of it among  the french pictures as if it had returned subsequently to florence   while vasari asserts that it never went there  but was sold to ottaviano  de  medici   footnote   life of andrea  del sarto   vol  in  p         as andrea painted no less than five pictures of this subject  of which  argenville mentions that there were two in france  one of which was sold  to the grand duke of tuscany  it is probable that the pitti one is not  that painted for francis i           chapter vi     andrea and ottaviano de  medici  a d                  the medici  always patrons of art  did not neglect to enrich their  palaces with the works of andrea del sarto  ottaviano de  medici  a  cousin of the reigning branch  was an especial friend of his  from  the time that andrea began the fresco of  caesar receiving tribute of  animals  in the hall of poggio a cajano  the commission came really from  pope leo x   who deputed cardinal giulio  his cousin  to have the hall  of the favourite family villa adorned with frescoes  he in turn handed  over the direction to ottaviano  who was a great amateur of art  it was  designed that andrea del sarto should cover a third of the hall  the  other two thirds being given to pontormo and francia bigio  the payment  of thirty scudi a month was arranged  in this andrea has shown his  genius in a style entirely new  the composition being crowded  the  perspective intricate  the background a building adorned with statues   the subject being allegorical  he has given the reins to his fancy and  produced a wonderful assemblage of strange beasts and stranger human  beings  moors  indians  and dwarfs  there are giraffes  lions  and  all kinds of animals  which he had an opportunity of studying in the  serraglio of florence  the drawing is true and free  the figures and  animals full of life  the colouring as usual well harmonised and bright   the pope died about this time in       and the picture was left to be  finished by allori in          ottaviano de  medici  being a great lover of art  was often a patron  on his own account  for him andrea painted the  holy family  now in the  pitti palace  it is a most charmingly natural group  the virgin seated  on the ground dances the divine child astride on her knee  he is turning  his head to the infant s  john who struggles to escape from his mother s  arms to get to him  the fresh youth of the virgin and the saintly age of  s  elizabeth are well contrasted  by the time this picture was finished  the siege of florence had begun  and when the painter took it to  ottaviano  he  having other claims on his means  excused himself from  buying it  and recommended andrea to offer it elsewhere  but the artist  replied   i have laboured for you  and the work shall be always yours     sell it and get what you can for it   again replied ottaviano  andrea  carried the painting home again and would never sell it to any one  a  few years after  the siege being over  and the medici re instated  he  again took the  holy family  to ottaviano  who was so delighted that he  paid him double the price for it     ottaviano also bought from carlo ginori a  madonna  and  s  job   a nude  half figure  which were by andrea s hand  he it was who commissioned him  to paint the portrait of cardinal giulio  afterwards pope clement vii    and it was also at his instance that the imitation raphael was painted  for the duke of mantua  the duke had set his heart on obtaining the  picture painted by raphael representing  leo x  between the cardinals  giulio and rossi   and got a promise of it as a gift from pope clement   his holiness wrote to ottaviano desiring him to have it sent to mantua   but ottaviano  appreciating the treasure as much as the duke of mantua   determined to secure it to the house of medici  under the pretence of  having a new frame made he gained time  and meanwhile employing andrea  del sarto secretly to make an exact copy of it  he sent that to the duke  instead of the original  so well had andrea imitated the great master s  style that every one in mantua  even giulio romano  raphael s own  scholar  was deceived  and it was only some years later that george  vasari divulged the secret and showed andrea s monogram on the side of  the panel beneath the frame  this copy is now at naples     the fresco at poggio a cajano abandoned  andrea returned to the scalzo   where he painted the  dance of herodias  martyrdom of s  john baptist   presentation of the head  allegory of hope   and the  apparition of the  angel to zacharias   the last was paid for august   nd           about this time there was a great wedding in florence  pier francesco  borgherini espoused margherita accajuoli  and salvi  the bridegroom s  father  determined to prepare for his son s bride a wedding chamber  which should be famous in all ages     baccio d  agnolo had carved wonderful coffers  chairs  and bedsteads  in walnut wood  pontormo painted beautiful cabinets and  cassoni   and  granacci  francesco d  ubertini verdi  called bacchiacca  and andrea  were all employed on the walls  andrea furnished two pictures  the one  tells the story of joseph in canaan  the other gives his life in egypt   the style is that of piero di cosimo  but with greater excellence and  more dignified figures  the landscape is highly finished and minute  and  has a part of the story in every nook of it     the centre group  where joseph leaves his father and mother to go to his  brethren  is very dignified  although fine enough to be a miniature  in  the second pharaoh s palace is  footnote  reumont   life of

are all italian  and as an  instance of andrea s versatility of talent they are very interesting  paintings     during the siege of florence  borgherini was absent  and the picture  dealer  giovanni battista della palla  who prowled like a harpy to carry  off treasures for the king of france  made an effort to obtain these  paintings by inducing the government to confiscate them and sell them to  him  but margherita was equal to the occasion  and meeting the despoiler  at her door  she poured out such a torrent of indignation  exhortation   and defiance as drove the broker away crestfallen     on the medici s return della palla was imprisoned as a traitor  and  beheaded at pisa  the paintings passed into the possession of the  medici  by purchase  during andrea s life   footnote  biadi

andrea obtained a commission through antonio brancacci   to paint some pictures in the convent of s  piero at luco in mugello   where he retired with his wife and her relations  and his pupil  raffaelo  they spent a very pleasant summer  the nuns made much of his  wife and her sisters  and he passed his time in earnest painting  the  fruits of his labour are a  pieta   a  visitation   and a  head of  christ   almost a replica of the one in the ss  annunziata     the  pieta  is full of expression and feeling  but more realistic and  less dignified than that of fra bartolommeo  which now hangs on the same  wall of the hall of apollo at the pitti     in colouring also there is a great contrast between the two  that of  fra bartolommeo being deep  rich  and mellow  while andrea s is more  profuse  diffused  and wanting in depth of shadow     s  john and the virgin raise the dead saviour  the magdalen and s   catherine weep at his feet  s  peter and s  paul at the back express  their grief in the manner natural to their characters  s  peter  in his  vehemence  flings up his arms in a madness of sorrow  s  paul  with more  dignity  is half stupefied with the intensity of woe     if those saints had been left in fra bartolommeo s  pieta   the  two pictures would have had the very same figures  in each  but how  different the composition  feeling  and expression  the frate s group is  a compact triangle  that of andrea a scattered arrangement  the magdalen  of the frate is overwhelmed with the very excess of love and grief  all  of which is expressed intensely  yet her face is hidden  that of andrea  is a mere woman dressed in flying scarf and flowing garments  but with  very little soul in her face     the characteristics of the two painters can be well studied in these  works  so near together  so similar  and yet so different     for the three works painted at luco andrea was paid ninety florins in  gold  the  pieta   was bought in later years by the grand duke leopold   and now adorns the pitti palace     the  visitation  was placed in the church of the convent over a  presepio   footnote  in      it was restored by luigi scotti and sold    biadi gives

the four above mentioned saints only  by  all the italian authors     the tabernacle  at the corner of the convent  outside the porta pinti   florence  was painted about this time  it is now quite destroyed by  age and weather  a good copy by empoli  exists  however  in the western  corridor of the uffizi  it is a charming  holy family  with the infant  s  john    a sweet laughing face  the madonna is a portrait of lucrezia     in the siege when the convent of the ingesuate  at the corner of which  it stood  was razed to the ground  this fresco  although loosened from  the wall  was spared by the soldiers  who had not courage to injure it   the grand duke cosimo was anxious to have it brought to florence  and  often came with engineers and architects  but they never hazarded its  removal   footnote  bocchi   bellezze di firenze   p           the duomo of pisa has five saints painted by andrea  they originally  formed one large picture in five compartments  and were painted for

off the repainting and restored them more  delicately     in      andrea had a commission to draw cartoons for painting the  balustrade of the ringhiera  a kind of wide terrace in front of the  palazzo della signoria  from which speeches were made to the populace   his designs were very beautiful and appropriate  the compartments being  emblematical of the different quarters of the city  besides which were  allegories of mountains  rivers  and virtues  the designs were left  unfinished at his death  and the ringhiera was never painted     in        he worked at the fresco of the  last supper   at s  salvi   which was intended to have been done when he began the four saints  there  in       had not some misunderstanding between the rulers of the  order prevented their continuation   footnote  vasari s  lives   vol   iii  p        even now he worked in a desultory manner  doing it bit by  bit  but in the end producing a marvellous work     the refectory is a long vaulted hall  and

contrast of the two faces being thus emphasized by proximity  s   peter  though old  has all the vehemence and intensity of his character   add to the feeling a brilliancy of colour of which andrea alone had the  secret  for without deep shadows  and keeping up the same intensity of  tone throughout  he yet obtained great harmony and full relief where  others would have produced a clash and flatness  messrs  crowe and  cavalcaselle say with justice   from the contemplation of the  cena   at  milan  we should say that the painter is high bred  looking at that of  s  salvi  that he is accustomed to lowly company    footnote   hist  of  painting   vol  iii  chap  xvii  p        but in some subjects a rugged  strength is more important than a high refinement  and in the group of  humble fishermen who formed the first church this is not out of place   if he could only have spiritualised christ  nothing would be left to be  desired     andrea del sarto was a member of a sacred company called the  fraternita  del nicchio   for which he painted a standard to be carried in their  processions  it is now in the hall of the old masters in the uffizi   and is a charming group of  s  james  with two children dressed in white  surplices   the habit of the company  the saint is caressing one   who kneels at his feet  the other has an open book in his hand   the draperies are especially graceful  and the expressions soft and  pleasing     after finishing a portrait of the intendant of the monks at vallombrosa   which the said monk afterwards placed in an arbour covered with vines   regardless of the injuries of wind and rain  andrea  having some colours  still left on his palette  took up a tile and called his wife to sit for  her portrait  that all might see how well she had kept her good looks  from her youth  but lucrezia not being inclined to sit  he got a mirror  and painted  his own portrait  on the tile instead  it was one of his  later works  and lucrezia kept it till her death  it is now in the room  of portraits in the uffizi  but much blackened by time  probably  also from the tile not having been properly prepared   footnote  this  portrait is given as a frontispiece      the next year or two were taken up in producing a number of large  altar pieces  and in painting pictures for the dealer  giovanni battista  della palla  who was still intent on supplying the king of france with  italian works of art  for him he painted a  sacrifice of abraham   which  vasari thinks one of his most excellent works  the face of the patriarch  is full of faith  and yet self sacrifice  the nude figure of isaac   bronzed in the parts which have been exposed to the sun  most tenderly  expresses a trembling dread  mingled with trust in his father  the  landscape is also very airy and beautiful  and a characteristic group of  a servant and the browsing ass is very effective in the background     he also painted a lovely picture of  charity with three children  for  della palla  both these works were done with great care  for he hoped by  their means to regain the lost favour of the king of france  it was  too late for this  however  and  as it happened  neither of these works  reached its destination  the siege of florence took place about this  time         the dealer  battista della palla  had his head cut off in  his dungeon at pisa  and all hope of his mediation with francis i  was  at an end  the  charity  was sold to domenico conti  the painter  after  andrea s death  and thence passed into the hands of the antinori family   the  sacrifice of abraham  has had more vicissitudes  filippo strozzi  purchased and gave it to the marchese del vasto  who had it in his  castle at ischia many years  later it was sent from florence to modena  in exchange for a correggio  and augustus ii  of saxony becoming its  purchaser  placed it in the dresden gallery     this seems to have been a favourite subject with andrea del sarto  who  repeated it five times        the one done by himself for the king of france        also in france  having been purchased from the grand duke of tuscany    see argenville         the one mentioned above  done for g  b  della palla        a smaller one  painted for paolo da terra rossa  a fine painting  for  which the artist asked so small a price that the purchaser was ashamed  to pay it  paolo sent it to naples        an unfinished painting of  abraham holding isaac by the hand   now in  the possession of the zonadari family  who obtained it from the peruzzi     during the siege  work was found for artists  but of an unpleasant  nature  andrea was commissioned  in       to paint the effigies of  some traitors on the palace of the signoria  he dared not refuse   but remembering that his namesake  andrea del castagno  who had been  similarly employed  gained the name of  andrea degli impiccati   he was  anxious that the same name should not attach to himself  accordingly he  had an enclosed platform made  and giving out that his pupil  bernardino  del buda  was going to paint the effigies  he worked at them himself  secretly  till  on being uncovered  they seemed to be real persons  writhing on the gibbet     no trace of them remains now  but the studies are in the collection of  drawings in the uffizi     a fine half length figure of  s  sebastian   for the brotherhood of that  name  which had its head quarters in the street in which andrea lived   was almost his last work in florence     the siege was now over  but the influx of soldiers from the camp  brought a return of the plague  which awakened great terror in the city   andrea s mode of life and love of good living did not conduce to his  safety  he was taken ill suddenly  and gave himself up for lost  neither  vasari nor biadi says he was entirely deserted by his wife  they only  hint that she came to his room as little as she could  having a great  fear of the plague     it is more than probable that andrea himself kept her away from him  for  his love was always unselfish  and he thought only of her good  however  this be  he died  aged forty two  on the   nd of january        and was  buried very quietly by the  brethren of the scalzo  in the church of the  s  annunziata  his tomb is beneath the pavement of the presbytery  on  the left hand  his older biographers seem to think this unostentatious  funeral a great slight to his merits  but if there were any doubts as  to his illness being the plague  it would only have been a natural  precaution to avoid spreading contagion by making his interment quite  private     that andrea had not wholly neglected his own family is proved by his  will  which left his property  after paying back lucrezia s  dot  of      scudi  and the money for the improvement of the new house in via  crocetta for her and her daughter  to his brother domenico  with  the proviso that after his death half the bequest should be given to  domenico s daughter as  dot   the rest to accrue to the hospital of  the innocenti  foundlings    footnote  ricordanze nel archivio del e   spedate degli innocenti di firenze  biadi   notizie   p           lucrezia lived to a good old age  being nearly ninety when she died   she seems to have lived a very quiet life  and to have kept andrea s  paintings with great care  except a few only which she sold  the house  in via crocetta passed many years afterwards into the possession of  another painter  zuccheri  who embellished the studio front with reliefs  in stone  representing the paraphernalia of an atelier  but it is  andrea s name which lives in the house  as his memory does in the  hearts of the florentine people  and his works in the cloisters of the  florentine churches  the people of the city always seem to claim del  sarto as especially their own  he is always  nostro pittore   or  nostro  maestro  and indeed as a master of fresco he never was surpassed  in  colouring he was in his way unique  in modelling  original and graceful   while the transparent clearness of his shadows and brilliant blending  of tints in the lights render his handling incomparable  a little more  refinement and aesthetic feeling would have placed him on a level with  the great leaders of the renaissance           chapter viii     scholars of andrea del sarto       andrea s scholars were numerous  though only a few rose to any great  eminence  of these  jacopo carrucci   da pontormo   born       died         was by far the most talented  left an orphan at an early age  the  charge of his sister devolved on him  and he placed her with a relation  while he was pursuing his art training  he studied under a diversity of  masters  including leonardo da vinci  albertinelli  piero di cosimo  and  finally  in       he entered andrea del sarto s school  but did not  stay long there either  some say andrea was jealous of his success  he   however  had generosity enough to praise and acknowledge his talent  and  to show his appreciation by giving him important work to do in his own  studio     pontormo did the predella to andrea s altar piece of the  annunciation   for the convent of s  gallo  his hand is to be seen also in several  of his master s works  he drew public attention first by painting two  figures of  faith  and  charity  on the escutcheon of the medici for  andrea di cosimo  who had obtained the commission  but did not feel  equal to executing it  michelangelo  on seeing these figures  prophesied  great things for the youth  who was at that time only nineteen years of  age     the people of pontormo  his native town  were so proud of him  that they  sent for him to emblazon the arms of pope leo over the gate of their  city     he was next employed by one of the festal companies of the age  called  the company of the diamond  to design cars  banners  and costumes for a  triumphal procession in honour of leo x  s elevation to the papal chair   and he organised a very suggestive array of the ages of man  illustrated  historically  he decorated the papal hall for leo x  s entrance  and  later began to be employed on more serious and lasting works     some good frescoes of his existed in the convent of santa caterina  but  were destroyed when the building was reconstructed in          a very charming fresco of the  visitation  still exists in the court  of the ss  annunziata  it shows him as a good pure colourist  the flesh  tints being especially tender  the composition is lively  full  and  effective     in      he painted a fine altar piece for the church of s  michele  visdomini  florence  by commission of francesco pucci  the  madonna    seated  is showing the child jesus to s  joseph  whose face is most  expressive and full of smiling admiration  s  john baptist stands near   at the sides are s  john evangelist  s  james  and s  francis  the  latter kneeling in ecstatic admiration     in some cases he was placed in direct competition with his master   andrea del sarto  being employed by borgherini to paint the coffers and  cabinets in the same room for which andrea did the  history of joseph    and again later at poggio a cajano  where the ends of the great hall  were assigned to him to paint  andrea and francia bigio taking the  larger walls at the sides  on one end he designed an allegory of   vertumnus   with his husbandmen around him busy with their labours  and  on the other  pomona  diana   c   perhaps in these last he has carried  his imitation of andrea del sarto rather too far in the matter of  draperies  which are too profuse and studied  indeed the whole works  are overdone  he was so anxious to rival his master that he forced his  invention  altering and labouring till all spontaneity was taken out of  his work  some of his frescoes were in the cloister of the certosa  but  they are not fair specimens of his best style  as they were done when  the florentine artists were smitten with the mania of imitating albrecht  duerer  and in these he has entirely followed the harder manner of that  artist without obtaining his strength  the frescoes are all scenes from  the  life of christ   and he spent several years over them  after which  he painted an altar piece     giovanni battista della palla commissioned him to paint a picture to be  sent to the king of france  and pontormo returning wisely to his natural  style  painted one of his masterpieces  the  resurrection of lazarus    the pitti palace possesses a curious specimen of his work  the         martyrs crucified in a wood in the persecution under the emperor  diocletian     he rose to renown as a portrait painter  but lost patronage in later  year by his capricious behaviour  refusing to work except for whom and  when he pleased  in company with his favourite pupil  bronzino  he did  the frescoes in the loggie of the medici villa at careggi  one loggia  was soon completed  to the great delight of the duke  but jacopo shut  himself up in the second and allowed no one to see what he was doing  for five years  when at length he uncovered the frescoes general  disappointment was the result  he pursued much the same line of conduct  in the frescoes of the roof of the medici chapel in san lorenzo  he kept  the chapel closed with walls and planks for eleven years  no one seeing  his progress except some young men who removed one of the rosettes from  the ceiling to peep in on him  but he discovered their plan  and closed  the holes more assiduously than ever  the composition is as confused as  it is diffusive  he tried to embody the whole teaching of the bible  but  becoming overwhelmed with the vastness of his subject  fell short even  of the excellence of his own previous works  he died before this work  was completed  of hydropsy  and was buried in the servite church     giorgio vasari  better known as the chronicler of the works of other  artists than for the excellence of his own  was born at arezzo         died at florence        his father was a painter  and the family  was connected by ties of relationship with luca signorelli of cortona   among the many masters under whom he studied was andrea del sarto   he did not remain long under his tuition  having contrived to offend  lucrezia in some way  he painted a great many frescoes at arezzo  where  he lived in his youth with his paternal uncle don antonio  don miniato  pitti  prior of the convent of monte oliveti  near siena  next employed  him to adorn the portico of his church  he had the good fortune to  attract the notice of cardinal ippolito de  medici  who took him to rome  in his suite  where he gained much advantage by the study of the works  of the great masters there  the medici family  especially andrea del  sarto s patron  ottaviano  were his constant friends  and their palaces  are profusely decorated by him  the riccardi palace has a room with  fresco scenes from the life of caesar  while painting these duke  alessandro gave him a salary of six crowns a month with a place at  his table  and board for his servant   c  the palace has several oil  paintings by vasari  amongst which are portraits of the duke and his  sister  after the death of duke alessandro and ottaviano he wandered  from city to city  painting so energetically that there are few of  the principal towns which do not possess some of his works  especially  naples  pisa  bologna  and arezzo  the palazzo san giorgio of the  farnese family  in rome  has a large hall richly frescoed by vasari  but  the best of his works are to be seen on the walls of the great hall of  the palazzo vecchio in florence  where he has illustrated the battles  of the florentines  and in several other rooms of the same palace  he  having continued all the later years of his life in the service of duke  cosimo  by whom the palace was restored and decorated  his works are too  numerous and not sufficiently important to catalogue or describe   his composition is overcrowded and wanting in perspective  there is  generally a superabundance of flesh  muscular limbs in all attitudes  form a great part of his pictures  but as the flesh tints he used were  wanting in mellowness and shadow  and have turned pink with age  they  compare disadvantageously with those of the more solid masters who  preceded him  after all  vasari s name and fame rest principally on  the labours of his pen  not those of his brush  his   lives of the  painters    although not a model of precision in facts or chronology  is  nevertheless the mine from which all subsequent art historians quarry to  obtain their information     one of the most valuable books of the day is probably the new edition  of vasari with corrections and notes taken from the archives by signer  gaetano milanesi     francesco rossi  de  salviati  born at florence        died at borne         was a great friend of vasari  his real name was rossi  his father  being a weaver of velvets  but he obtained the name of salviati from  being the protege of the cardinal of that name  his first master was  raffaello del brescia  but in      he  with his friend nannoccio   entered the school of andrea del sarto  with whom they stayed during  the siege  becoming known by some paintings done for the friars of the  badia  cardinal salviati took him into his house  gave him a stipend of  four crowns a month  and an apartment at the borgo vecchio  he painting  any works the cardinal wished  francesco was not idle  a great number  of frescoes  altar pieces  and portraits   c    c   testifying to his  industry  in his later years he was employed with his friend vasari in  the palazzo vecchio  where he painted the frescoes in the smaller hall  of audience  these are principally scenes from the  life of camillus    the story of the schoolmaster of falerii is very spirited  and the   triumph of camillus  varied and pleasing in colouring  although  melancholy and suspicious  often making enemies and losing patronage by  misunderstandings  rossi and vasari were always faithful to their first  boyish friendship  often working together  but never with any spirit  of rivalry  salviati s style was bold and spirited  he was rich in  invention  but perhaps a little wild in the matter of draperies and  bizarre costumes  his colouring is more pleasing than that of vasari   but is diffusive and wanting in depth     domenico conti never became famous  but in spite of want of genius  he  was andrea s favourite pupil  all his master s designs and cartoons came  into his possession at andrea s death  but he was unfortunately robbed  of them soon afterwards  the inscription to andrea del sarto which once  existed in the church of ss  annunziata was put up by conti     jacopo del conte              who in vasari s time lived in rome  is  chiefly noted for his likenesses of several pontiffs and personages  of the papal court  there are a few altar pieces by him in rome  and a   deposition  in the church of the misericordia in florence  but he was  almost exclusively a portrait painter     andrea sguazzella  called nannoccio  remained in france after having  accompanied andrea del sarto thither  cardinal tournon took him under  his patronage  and he painted a large number of works in the style of  andrea     jacopo  called jacone  was another of andrea s favourite disciples  his  frescoes  of which some existed till of late years on the facade of the  palazzo buondelmonte  in florence  were much in del sarto s manner   he assisted his master in a great many of his works  while of his  independent paintings many were sent to france  no doubt some of these   as well as sguazzella s  figure under the master s name in that list of  fifty works given by argenville  he was too idle and fond of pleasure  to rise to eminence  though he did some good frescoes in the palazzo  capponi at florence  and in the capponi villa at montici  and assisted  jacopo da pontormo in the hall of the medici villa at careggi  he died  in       in great poverty     pier francesco di jacopo di sandro was said to have had some talent  he  and domenico conti were employed among others in decorating the court of  the palazzo vecchio on the occasion of cosimo de  medici s marriage with  leonora di toledo  there are some altar pieces of his in the church of  santo spirito  florence     solosmeo  raffaello  and bernardino del buda were three  garzoni  in  andrea s studio  they were employed in the subordinate work and manual  labour  but were

lit up below by the soft light  while the outline  of the upper part could scarce be made out  eastern as the scene was   the actors were for the most part english  although the crowd that  promenaded the terrace was composed principally of men  of whom the  majority were in uniform of one sort or another  the rest in evening  dress  there were many ladies among them     at the end of one of the terraces a band of the    d bengal infantry  was playing  and when they ceased a band of native musicians  at the  opposite end of the terrace  took up the strains  within  the palace was  brilliantly lighted  and at the tables in one of the large apartments  a few couples were still seated at supper  among his guests moved  the rajah  chatting in fluent english  laughing with the men  paying  compliments to the ladies  a thoroughly good fellow all round  as his  guests agreed  the affair had been a great success  there had first been  a banquet to the officers and civilians at the neighboring station  when  this was over  the ladies began to arrive  and for their amusement there  had been a native nautch upon a grand scale  followed by a fine display  of fireworks  and then by supper  at which the rajah had made a speech  expressive of his deep admiration and affection for the british  this he  had followed up by proposing the health of the ladies in flowery terms   never was there a better fellow than the rajah  he had english tastes   and often dined at one or other of the officers  messes  he was a good  shot  and could fairly hold his own at billiards  he had first rate  english horses in his stables  and his turnout was perfect in all  respects  he kept a few horses for the races  and was present at every  ball and entertainment  at bithoor he kept almost open house  there was  a billiard room and racquet courts  and once or twice a week there were  luncheon parties  at which from twelve to twenty officers were generally  present  in all india there was no rajah with more pronounced english  tastes or greater affection for english people  the one regret of his  life  he often declared  was that his color and his religion prevented  his entertaining the hope of obtaining an english wife  all this  as  everyone said  was the more remarkable and praiseworthy  inasmuch as he  had good grounds of complaint against the british government     with the ladies he was an especial favorite  he was always ready to show  them courtesy  his carriages were at their service  he was ready to  give his aid and assistance to every gathering  his private band played  frequently on the promenade  and handsome presents of shawls and jewelry  were often made to those whom he held in highest favor  at present he  was talking to general wheeler and some other officers      i warn you that i mean to win the cup at the races   he said   i have  just bought the horse that swept the board on the bombay side  i have  set my heart on winning the cup  and so secured this horse  i am ready  to back it if any of you gentlemen are disposed to wager against it       all in good time  rajah   one of the officers laughed   we don t know  what will be entered against it yet  and we must wait to see what the  betting is  but i doubt whether we have anything that will beat the  bombay crack on this side  i fancy you will have to lay odds on       we shall see   the rajah said   i have always been unlucky  but i mean  to win this time       i don t think you take your losses much to heart  rajah   general  wheeler said   yet there is no doubt that your bets are generally  somewhat rash ones       i mean to make a coup this time  that is your word for a big thing   i think  the government has treated me so badly i must try to take  something out of the pockets of its officers       you do pretty well still   the general laughed   after this splendid  entertainment you have given us this evening you can hardly call  yourself a poor man       i know i am rich  i have enough for my little pleasures  i do not know  that i could wish for more  still no one is ever quite content      by this time the party was breaking up  and for the next half hour the  rajah was occupied in bidding goodby to his guests  when the last had  gone he turned and entered the palace  passed through the great halls   and  pushing aside a curtain  entered a small room  the walls and the  columns were of white marble  inlaid with arabesque work of colored  stones  four golden lamps hung from the ceiling  the floor was covered  with costly carpets  and at one end ran a raised platform a foot in  height  piled with soft cushions  he took a turn or two up and down the  room  and then struck a silver bell  an attendant entered      send khoosheal and imambux here      two minutes later the men entered  imambux commanded the rajah s troops   while khoosheal was the master of his household      all has gone off well   the rajah said   i am pleased with you   khoosheal  one more at most  and we shall have done with them  little do  they think what their good friend nana sahib is preparing for them  what  a poor spirited creature they think me to kiss the hand that robbed me   to be friends with those who have deprived me of my rights  but the day  of reckoning is not far off  and then woe to them all  have any of your  messengers returned  imambux       several have come in this evening  my lord  would you see them now  or  wait till morning       i will see them now  i will get the memory of these chattering men and  these women with their bare shoulders out of my mind  send the men in  one by one  i have no further occasion for you tonight  two are better  than three when men talk of matters upon which an empire depends      the two officers bowed and retired  and shortly afterwards the attendant  drew back the curtain again  and a native  in the rags of a mendicant   entered  and bowed till his forehead touched the carpet  then he  remained kneeling  with his arms crossed over his chest  and his head  inclined in the attitude of the deepest humility      where have you been   the rajah asked      my lord s slave has been for three weeks at meerut  i have obeyed  orders  i have distributed chupaties among the native regiments  with  the words   watch  the time is coming   and have then gone before i  could be questioned  then  in another disguise  i have gone through  the bazaar  and said in talk with many that the sepoys were unclean and  outcast  for that they had bitten cartridges anointed with pig s fat   and that the government had purposely greased the cartridges with this  fat in order that the caste of all the sepoys should be destroyed  when  i had set men talking about this i left  it will be sure to come to the  sepoys  ears      the rajah nodded   come again tomorrow at noon  you will have your  reward then and further orders  but see that you keep silence  a single  word  and though you hid in the farthest corner of india you would not  escape my vengeance      man after man entered  some of them  like the first  were in mendicant s  attire  one or two were fakirs  one looked like a well to do merchant   with the exception of the last  all had a similar tale to tell  they  had been visiting the various cantonments of the native army  everywhere  distributing chupaties and whispering tales of the intention of the  government to destroy the caste of the sepoys by greasing the cartridges  with pig s fat  the man dressed like a trader was the last to enter      how goes it  mukdoomee       it is well  my lord  i have traversed all the districts where we dwelt  of old  before the feringhee stamped us out and sent scores to death and  hundreds to prison  most of the latter whom death has spared are free  now  and with many of them have i talked  they are most of them old  and  few would take the road again  but scarce one but has trained up his son  or grandson to the work  not to practice it   the hand of the whites was  too heavy before  and the gains are not large enough to tempt men to run  the risk  but they teach them for the love of the art  to a worshiper of  the goddess there is a joy in a cleverly contrived plan and in casting  the roomal round the neck of the victim  that can never die  often in  my young days  when perhaps twelve of us were on the road in a party  we  made less than we could have done by labor  but none minded      we were sworn brothers  we were working for kali  and so that we sent  her victims we cared little  and even after fifteen or twenty years  spent in the feringhee s prisons  we love it still  none hate the white  man as we do  has he not destroyed our profession  we have two things  to work for  first  for vengeance  second  for the certainty that if the  white man s raj were at an end  once again would the brotherhood follow  their profession  and reap booty for ourselves and victims for  kali  for  assuredly  no native prince would dare to meddle with us   therefore  upon every man who was once a thug  and upon his sons and  grandsons  you may depend  i do not say that they would be useful for  fighting  for we have never been fighters  but the stranglers will be of  use  you can trust them with missions  and send them where you choose   from their fathers  lips they have learnt all about places and roads   they can decoy feringhee travelers  the company s servants or soldiers   into quiet places  and slay them  they can creep into compounds and into  houses  and choose their victims from the sleepers  you can trust them   rajah  for they have learned to hate  and each in his way will  when the  times comes  aid to stir up men to rise  the past had almost become a  dream  but i have roused it into life again  and upon the descendants of  the stranglers throughout india you can count surely       you have not mentioned my name   the rajah said suddenly  looking  closely at the man as he put the question      assuredly not  your highness  i have simply said deliverance is at  hand  the hour foretold for the end of the raj of the men from beyond  the sea will soon strike  and they will disappear from the land like  fallen leaves  then will the glory of kali return  then again will the  brotherhood take to the road and gather in victims  i can promise that  every one of those whose fathers or grandfathers or other kin died by  the hand of the feringhee  or suffered in his prisons  will do his share  of the good work  and be ready to obey to the death the orders which  will reach him       it is good   the rajah said   you and your brethren will have a rich  harvest of victims  and the sacred cord need never be idle  go  it is  well nigh morning  and i would sleep      but not for some time did the rajah close his eyes  his brain was busy  with the schemes which he had long been maturing  but was only now  beginning to put into action      it must succeed   he said to himself   all through india the people  will take up arms when the sepoys give the signal by rising against  their officers  the whites are wholly unsuspicious  they even believe  that i  i whom they have robbed  am their friend  fools  i hold them in  the hollow of my hand  they shall trust me to the last  and then i will  crush them  not one shall escape me  would i were as certain of all the  other stations in india as i am of this  oude  i know  will rise as  one man  the princes of delhi i have sounded  they will be the leaders   though the old king will be the nominal head  but i shall pull the  strings  and as peishwa  shall be an independent sovereign  and next in  dignity to the emperor  only nothing must be done until all is ready   not a movement must be made until i feel sure that every native regiment  from calcutta to the north is ready to rise      and so  until the day had fully broken  the rajah of bithoor thought  over his plans  the man who had a few hours before so sumptuously  entertained the military and civilians of cawnpore  and the man who was  universally regarded as the firm friend of the british and one of the  best fellows going     the days and weeks passed on  messengers came and went  the storm was  slowing brewing  and yet to all men it seemed that india was never more  contented nor the outlook more tranquil and assured         chapter ii       a young man in a suit of brown karkee  with a white puggaree wound  round his pith helmet  was just mounting in front of his bungalow at  deennugghur  some forty miles from cawnpore  when two others came up      which way are you going to ride  bathurst       i am going out to narkeet  there is a dispute between the villagers and  a talookdar as to their limits  i have got to look into the case  why do  you ask  mr  hunter       i thought that you might be going that way  you know we have had  several reports of ravages by a man eater whose headquarters seem to  be that big jungle you pass through on your way to narkeet  he has been  paying visits to several villages in its neighborhood  and has carried  off two mail runners  i should advise you to keep a sharp lookout       yes  i have heard plenty about him  it is unfortunate we have no one at  this station who goes in for tiger hunting  young bloxam was speaking  to me last night  he is very hot about it  but as he knows nothing about  shooting  and has never fired off a rifle in his life  except at the  military target  i told him that it was madness to think of it by  himself  and that he had better ride down to the regiment at cawnpore   and get them to form a party to come up to hunt the beast  i told him  they need not bring elephants with them  i could get as many as were  necessary from some of the talookdars  and there will be no want of  beaters  he said he would write at once  but he doubted whether any of  them would be able to get away at present  the general inspection is  just coming on  however  no doubt they will be able to do so before  long       well  if i were you i would put a pair of pistols into my holster   bathurst  it would be awfully awkward if you came across the beast       i never carry firearms   the young man said shortly  and then more  lightly   i am a peaceful man by profession  as you are  mr  hunter   and i leave firearms to those whose profession it is to use them  i  have hitherto never met with an occasion when i needed them  and am not  likely to do so  i always carry this heavy hunting whip  which i find  useful sometimes  when the village dogs rush out and pretend that they  are going to attack me  and i fancy that even an oude swordsman would  think twice before attacking me when i had it in my hand  but  of  course  there is no fear about the tiger  i generally ride pretty fast   and even if he were lying by the roadside waiting for a meal  i don t  think he would be likely to interfere with me      so saying  he lightly touched the horse s flanks with his spurs and  cantered off      he s a fine young fellow  garnet   mr  hunter said to his companion    full of energy  and  they say  the very best linguist in oude       yes  he is all that   the other agreed   but he is a sort of fellow  one does not quite understand  i like a man who is like other fellows   bathurst isn t  he doesn t shoot  he doesn t ride  i mean he don t care  for pig sticking  he never goes in for any fun there may be on hand  he  just works  nothing else  he does not seem to mix with other people   he is the sort of fellow one would say had got some sort of secret  connected with him       if he has  i am certain it is nothing to his personal disadvantage    mr  hunter said warmly   i have known him for the last six years  i  won t say very well  for i don t think anyone does that  except   perhaps  doctor wade  when there was a wing of the regiment up here  three years ago he and bathurst took to each other very much  perhaps  because they were both different from other people  but  anyhow  from  what i know of bathurst i believe him to be a very fine character   though there is certainly an amount of reserve about him altogether  unusual  at any rate  the service is a gainer by it  i never knew a  fellow work so indefatigably  he will take a very high place in the  service before he has done       i am not so sure of that   the other said   he is a man with opinions  of his own  and all sorts of crotchets and fads  he has been in hot  water with the chief commissioner more than once  when i was over at  lucknow last i was chatting with two or three men  and his name happened  to crop up  and one of them said   bathurst is a sort of knight errant   an official don quixote  perhaps the best officer in the province in  some respects  but hopelessly impracticable        yes  that i can quite understand  garnet  that sort of man is never  popular with the higher official  whose likings go to the man who does  neither too much nor too little  who does his work without questioning   and never thinks of making suggestions  and is a mere official machine   men of bathurst s type  who go to the bottom of things  protest against  what they consider unfair decisions  and send in memorandums showing  that their superiors are hopelessly ignorant and idiotically wrong  are  always cordially disliked  still  they generally work their way to the  front in the long run  well  i must be off      bathurst rode to narkeet without drawing rein  his horse at times  slackened its pace on its own accord  but an almost mechanical motion  from its rider s heel soon started it off again at the rapid pace at  which its rider ordinarily traveled  from the time he left deennugghur  to his arrival at narkeet no thought of the dreaded man eater entered  bathurst s mind  he was deeply meditating on a memorandum he was about  to draw up  respecting a decision that had been arrived at in a case  between a talookdar in his district and the government  and in which  as  it appeared to him  a wholly erroneous and unjust view had been taken  as to the merits of the case  and he only roused himself when the horse  broke into a walk as it entered the village  two or three of the head  men  with many bows and salutations of respect  came out to receive him      my lord sahib has seen nothing of the tiger   the head man said   our  hearts were melted with fear  for the evil beast was heard roaring in  the jungle not far from the road early this morning       i never gave it a thought  one way or the other   bathurst said  as he  dismounted   i fancy the horse would have let me know if the brute had  been anywhere near  see that he is tied up in the shed  and has food and  water  and put a boy to keep the flies from worrying him  and now let us  get to business  first of all  i must go through the village records  and documents  after that i will question four or five of the oldest  inhabitants  and then we must go over the ground  the whole question  turns  you know  upon whether the irrigation ditch mentioned in the  talookdar s grant is the one that runs across at the foot of the rising  ground on his side  or whether it is the one that sweeps round on this  side of the grove with the little temple in it  unfortunately most of  the best land lies between those ditches      for hours bathurst listened to the statements of the old people of the  village  cross questioning them closely  and sparing no efforts to sift  the truth from their confused and often contradictory evidence  then he  spent two hours going over the ground and endeavoring to satisfy himself  which of the two ditches was the one named in the village records  he  had two days before taken equal pains in sifting the evidence on the  other side      i trust that my lord sees there can be no doubt as to the justice of  our claim   the head man said humbly  as he prepared to mount again      according to your point of view  there is no doubt about it  childee   but then there is equally no doubt the other way  according to the  statements they put forward  but that is generally the way in all these  land disputes  for good hard swearing your hindoo cultivator can be  matched against the world  unfortunately there is nothing either in your  grant or in your neighbors  that specifies unmistakably which of these  ancient ditches is the one referred to  my present impression is that it  is essentially a case for a compromise  but you know the final decision  does not rest on me  i shall be out here again next week  and i shall  write to the talookdar to meet me here  and we will go over the ground  together again  and see if we cannot arrange some line that will be fair  to both parties  if we can do that  the matter would be settled without  expense and trouble  whereas  if it goes up to lucknow it may all have  to be gone into again  and if the decision is given against you  and as  far as i can see it is just as likely to be one way as another  it will  be a serious thing for the village       we are in my lord s hands   the native said   he is the protector of  the poor  and will do us justice       i will do you justice  childee  but i must do justice to the other side  too  of course  neither of you will be satisfied  but that cannot be  helped      his perfect knowledge of their language  the pains he took to sift all  matters brought before him to the bottom  had rendered the young officer  very popular among the natives  they knew they could get justice from  him direct  there was no necessity to bribe underlings  he had the  knack of extracting the truth from the mass of lying evidence always  forthcoming in native cases  and even the defeated party admired the  manner in which the fabric of falsehood was pulled to pieces  but the  main reason of his popularity was his sympathy  the real interest which  he showed in their cases  and the patience with which he listened to  their stories     bathurst himself  as he rode homewards  was still thinking of the  case  of course there had been lying on both sides  but to that he was  accustomed  it was a question of importance  of greater importance  no  doubt  to the villagers than to their opponent  but still important  to him  for this tract of land was a valuable one  and of considerable  extent  and there was really nothing in the documents produced on either  side to show which ditch was intended by the original grants  evidently   at the time they were made  very many years before  one ditch or the  other was not in existence  but there was no proof as to which was the  more recent  although both sides professed that all traditions handed  down to them asserted the ditch on their side to be the more recent     he was riding along the road through the great jungle  at his horse s  own pace  which happened for the moment to be a gentle trot  when  a piercing cry rang through the air a hundred yards ahead  bathurst  started from his reverie  and spurred his horse sharply  the animal  dashed forward at a gallop  at a turn in the road he saw  twenty yards  ahead of him  a tiger  standing with a foot upon a prostrate figure   while a man in front of it was gesticulating wildly  the tiger stood as  if hesitating whether to strike down the figure in front or to content  itself with that already in its power     the wild shouts of the man had apparently drowned the sound of the  horse s feet upon the soft road  for the animal drew back half a pace as  it suddenly came into view     the horse swerved at the sight  and reared high in the air as bathurst  drove his spurs into it  as its feet touched the ground again  bathurst  sprang off and rushed at the tiger  and brought down the heavy lash  of his whip with all his force across its head  with a fierce snarl it  sprang back two paces  but again and again the whip descended upon it   and bewildered and amazed at the attack it turned swiftly and sprang  through the bushes     bathurst  knowing that there was no fear of its returning  turned at  once to the figure on the road  it was  as in even the momentary glance  he had noticed  a woman  or rather a girl of some fourteen or fifteen  years of age  the man had dropped on his knees beside her  moaning and  muttering incoherent words      i see no blood   bathurst said  and stooping  lifted the light figure    her heart beats  man  i think she has only fainted  the tiger must have  knocked her down in its spring without striking her  so far as i can see  she is unhurt      he carried her to the horse  which stood trembling a few yards away   took a flask from the holster  and poured a little brandy and water  between her lips     presently there was a faint sigh   she is coming round   he said to the  man  who was still kneeling  looking on with vacant eyes  as though he  had neither heard nor comprehended what bathurst was doing  presently  the girl moved slightly and opened her eyes  at first there was no  expression in them  then a vague wonder stole into them at the white  face looking down upon her     she closed them again  and then reopened them  and then there was a  slight struggle to free herself  he allowed her to slip through his arms  until her feet touched the ground  then her eyes fell on the kneeling  figure      father   she exclaimed  with a cry the man leaped to his feet  sprang  to her and seized her in his arms  and poured out words of endearment   then suddenly he released her and threw himself on the ground before  bathurst  with ejaculations of gratitude and thankfulness      get up  man  get up   the latter said   your daughter can scarce stand  alone  and the sooner we get away from this place the better  that  savage beast is not likely to return  but he may do so  let us be off      he mounted his horse again  brought it up to the side of the girl  and  then  leaning over  took her and swung her into the saddle in front of  him  the man took up a large box that was lying in the road and hoisted  it onto his shoulders  and then  at a foot s pace  they proceeded on  their way  bathurst keeping a close watch on the jungle at the side on  which the tiger had entered it      how came you to travel along this road alone   he asked the man   the  natives only venture through in large parties  because of this tiger       i am a stranger   the man answered   i heard at the village where we  slept last night that there was a tiger in this jungle  but i thought  we should be through it before nightfall  and therefore there was no  danger  if one heeded all they say about tigers one would never travel  at all  i am a juggler  and we are on our way down the country through  cawnpore and allahabad  had it not been for the valor of my lord sahib   we should never have got there  for had i lost my rabda  the light of  my heart  i should have gone no further  but should have waited for the  tiger to take me also       there was no particular valor about it   bathurst said shortly   i saw  the beast with its foot on your daughter  and dismounted to beat it off  just as if it had been a dog  without thinking whether there was any  danger in it or not  men do it with savage beasts in menageries every  day  they are cowardly brutes after all  and can t stand the lash  he  was taken altogether by surprise  too       my lord has saved my daughter s life  and mine is at his service  henceforth   the man said   the mouse is a small beast  but he may  warn the lion  the white sahibs are brave and strong  would one of my  countrymen have ventured his life to attack a tiger  armed only with a  whip  for the sake of the life of a poor wayfarer       yes  i think there are many who would have done so   bathurst replied    you do your countrymen injustice  there are plenty of brave men among  them  and i have heard before now of villagers  armed only with sticks   attacking a tiger who has carried off a victim from among them  you  yourself were standing boldly before it when i came up       my child was under its feet  besides  i never thought of myself  if  i had had a weapon i should not have drawn it  i had no thought of the  tiger  i only thought that my child was dead  she works with me  sahib   since her mother died  five years ago  we have traveled together over  the country  she plays while i conjure  she takes round the saucer for  the money  and she acts with me in the tricks that require two persons   it is she who disappears from the basket  we are everything to each  other  sahib  but what is my lord s name  will he tell his servant  that  he and rabda may think of him and talk of him as they tramp the roads  together       my name is ralph bathurst  i am district officer at deennugghur  how  far are you going this evening       we shall sleep at the first village we come to  sahib  we have walked  many hours today  and this box  though its contents are not weighty   is heavy to bear  we thought of going down tomorrow to deennugghur  and  showing our performances to the sahib logue there       very well  but there is one thing  what is your name       rujub       well  rujub  if you go on to deennugghur tomorrow say nothing to anyone  there about this affair with the tiger  it is nothing to talk about  i  am not a shikari  but a hard working official  and i don t want to be  talked about       the sahib s wish shall be obeyed   the man said      you can come round to my bungalow and ask for me  i shall be glad to  hear whether your daughter is any the worse for her scare  how do you  feel  rabda       i feel as one in a dream  sahib  i saw a great yellow beast springing  through the air  and i cried out  and knew nothing more till i saw the  sahib s face  and now i have heard him and my father talking  but their  voices sound to me as if far away  though i know that you are holding  me       you will be all the better after a night s rest  child  no wonder you  feel strange and shaken  another quarter of an hour and we shall be at  the village  i suppose  rujub  you were born a conjurer       yes  sahib  it is always so  it goes down from father to son  as soon  as i was able to walk  i began to work with my father  and as i grew  up he initiated me in the secrets of our craft  which we may never  divulge       no  i know they are a mystery  many of your tricks can be done by our  conjurers at home  but there are some that have never been solved       i have been offered  more than once  large sums by english sahibs to  tell them how some of the feats were done  but i could not  we are bound  by terrible oaths  and  in no case has a juggler proved false to them   were one to do so he would be slain without mercy  and his fate in the  next world would be terrible  forever and forever his soul would pass  through the bodies of the foulest and lowest creatures  and there would  be no forgiveness for him  i would give my life for the sahib  but even  to him i would not divulge our mysteries      in a few minutes they came to the first village beyond the jungle  as  they approached it bathurst checked his horse and lifted the girl down   she took his hand and pressed her forehead to it      i shall see you tomorrow  then  rujub   he said  and shaking the reins   went on at a canter      that is a new character for me to come out in   he said bitterly   i do  not know myself  i  of all men  but there was no bravery in it  it never  occurred to me to be afraid  i just thrashed him off as i should beat  off a dog who was killing a lamb  there was no noise  and it is noise  that frightens me  if the brute had roared i should assuredly have run   i know it would have been so  i could not have helped it to have saved  my life  it is an awful curse that i am not as other men  and that i  tremble and shake like a girl at the sound of firearms  it would have  been better if i had been killed by the first shot fired in the punjaub  eight years ago  or if i had blown my brains out at the end of the day   good heavens  what have i suffered since  but i will not think of it   thank god  i have got my work  and as long as i keep my thoughts on that  there is no room for that other   and then  by a great effort of will   ralph bathurst put the past behind him  and concentrated his thoughts on  the work on which he had been that day engaged     the juggler did not arrive on the following evening as he had expected   but late in the afternoon a native boy brought in a message from him   saying that his daughter was too shaken and ill to travel  but that they  would come when she recovered     a week later  on returning from a long day s work  bathurst was told  that a juggler was in the veranda waiting to see him      i told him  sahib   the servant said   that you cared not for such  entertainments  and that he had better go elsewhere  but he insisted  that you yourself had told him to come  and so i let him wait       has he a girl with him  jafur       yes  sahib      bathurst strolled round to the other side of the bungalow  where rujub  was sitting patiently  with rabda wrapped in her blue cloth beside him   they rose to their feet      i am glad to see your daughter is better again  rujub       she is better  sahib  she has had fever  but is restored       i cannot see your juggling tonight  rujub  i have had a heavy day s  work  and am worn out  and have still much to do  you had better go  round to some of the other bungalows  though i don t think you will do  much this evening  for there is a dinner party at the collector s  and  almost everyone will be there  my servants will give you food  and i  shall be off at seven o clock in the morning  but shall be glad to see  you before i start  are you in want of money   and he put his hand in  his pocket      no  sahib   the juggler said   we have money sufficient for all our  wants  we are not thinking of performing tonight  for rabda is not  equal to it  before sunrise we shall be on our way again  i must be at  cawnpore  and we have delayed too long already  could you give us but  half an hour tonight  sahib  we will come at any hour you like  i would  show you things that few englishmen have seen  not mere common tricks   sahib  but mysteries such as are known to few even of us  do not say no   sahib       well  if you wish it  rujub  i will give you half an hour   and  bathurst looked at his watch   it is seven now  and i have to dine  i  have work to do that will take me three hours at least  but at eleven i  shall have finished  you will see a light in my room  come straight to  the open window       we will be there  sahib   and with a salaam the juggler walked off   followed by his daughter     a few minutes before the appointed time bathurst threw down his pen with  a little sigh of satisfaction     the memo he had just finished was a most conclusive one  it seemed  to him unanswerable  and that the department would have trouble in  disputing his facts and figures  he had not since he sat down to his  work given another thought to the juggler  and he almost started as a  figure appeared in the veranda at the open window      ah  rujub  is it you  i have just finished my work  come in  is rabda  with you       she will remain outside until i want her   the juggler said as he  entered and squatted himself on the floor   i am not going to juggle   sahib  with us there are two sorts of feats  there are those that are  performed by sleight of hand or by means of assistance  these are the  juggler s tricks we show in the verandas and compounds of the white  sahibs  and in the streets of the cities  there are others that are  known only to the higher order among us  that we show only on rare  occasions  they have come to us from the oldest times  and it is said  they were brought by wise men from egypt  but that i know not       i have always been interested in juggling  and have seen many things  that i cannot understand   bathurst said   i have seen the basket trick  done on the road in front of the veranda  as well as in other places   and i cannot in any way account for it      the juggler took from his basket a piece of wood about two feet in  length and some four inches in diameter      you see this   he said     bathurst took it in his hand   it looks like a bit sawn off a telegraph  pole   he said      will you come outside  sahib      the night was very dark  but the lamp on the table threw its light  through the window onto the drive in front of the veranda  rujub took  with him a piece of wood about nine inches square  with a soft pad on  the top  he went out in the drive and placed the piece of pole upright   and laid the wood with the cushion on the top      now will you stand in the veranda a while      bathurst stood back by the side of the window so as not to interfere  with the passage of the light  rabda stole forward and sat down upon the  cushion      now watch  sahib      bathurst looked  and saw the block of wood apparently growing  gradually  it rose until rabda passed up beyond the light in the room      you may come out   the juggler said   but do not touch the pole  if you  do  it will cause a fall  which would be fatal to my child      bathurst stepped out and looked up  he could but just make out the  figure of rabda  seemingly already higher than the top of the bungalow   gradually it became more and more indistinct      you are there  rabda   her father said      i am here  father   and the voice seemed to come from a considerable  distance     again and again the question was asked  and the answer became fainter  and fainter  although it sounded as if it was a distant cry in response  to rujub s shout rather than spoken in an ordinary voice     at last no response was heard      now it shall descend   the juggler said     two or three minutes passed  and then bathurst  who was staring up into  the darkness  could make out the end of the pole with the seat upon  it  but rabda was no longer there  rapidly it sank  until it stood its  original height on the ground      where is rabda   bathurst exclaimed      she is here  my lord   and as he spoke rabda rose from a sitting  position on the balcony close to bathurst      it is marvelous   the latter exclaimed   i have heard of that feat  before  but have never seen it  may i take up that piece of wood       assuredly  sahib      bathurst took it up and carried it to the light  it was undoubtedly   as he had before supposed  a piece of solid wood  the juggler had not  touched it  or he would have supposed he might have substituted for the  piece he first examined a sort of telescope of thin sheets of steel  but  even that would not have accounted for rabda s disappearance      i will show you one other feat  my lord      he took a brass dish  placed a few pieces of wood and charcoal in it   struck a match  and set the wood on fire  and then fanned it until the  wood had burned out  and the charcoal was in a glow  then he sprinkled  some powder upon it  and a dense white smoke rose      now turn out the lamp  sahib      bathurst did so  the glow of the charcoal enabled him still to see the  light smoke  this seemed to him to become clearer and clearer      now for the past   rujub said  the smoke grew brighter and brighter   and mixed with flashes of color  presently bathurst saw clearly an  indian scene  a village stood on a crest  jets of smoke darted up  from between the houses  and then a line of troops in scarlet uniform  advanced against the village  firing as they went  they paused for a  moment  and then with a rush went at the village and disappeared in the  smoke over the crest      good heavens   bathurst muttered   it is the battle of chillianwalla       the future   rujub said  and the colors on the smoke changed  bathurst  saw a wall surrounding a courtyard  on one side was a house  it had  evidently been besieged  for in the upper part were many ragged holes   and two of the windows were knocked into one  on the roof were men  firing  and there were one or two women among them  he could see their  faces and features distinctly  in the courtyard wall there was a gap   and through this a crowd of sepoys were making their way  while a  handful of whites were defending a breastwork  among them he recognized  his own figure  he saw himself club his rifle and leap down into the  middle of the sepoys  fighting furiously there  the colors faded away   and the room was in darkness again  there was the crack of a match  and  then rujub said quietly   if you will lift off the globe again  i will  light the lamp  sahib      bathurst almost mechanically did as he was told      well  sahib  what do you think of the pictures       the first was true   bathurst said quietly   though  how you knew i was  with the regiment that stormed the village at chillianwalla i know not   the second is certainly not true       you can never know what the future will be  sahib   the juggler said  gravely      that is so   bathurst said   but i know enough of myself to say that  it cannot be true  i do not say that the sepoys can never be fighting  against whites  improbable as it seems  but that i was doing what that  figure did is  i know  impossible       time will show  sahib   the juggler said   the pictures never lie   shall i show you other things       no  rujub  you have shown me enough  you have astounded me  i want to  see no more tonight       then farewell  sahib  we shall meet again  i doubt not  and mayhap i  may be able to repay the debt i owe you   and rujub  lifting his basket   went out through the window without another word         chapter iii       some seven or eight officers were sitting round the table in the  messroom of the    d bengal infantry at cawnpore  it had been a guest  night  but the strangers had left  the lights had been turned out in the  billiard room overhead  the whist party had broken up  and the players  had rejoined three officers who had remained at table smoking and  talking quietly     outside  through the open french windows  the ground looked as if  sprinkled with snow beneath the white light of the full moon  two or  three of the mess servants were squatting in the veranda  talking in low  voices  a sentry walked backwards and forwards by the gate leading into  the mess house compound  beyond  the maidan stretched away flat and  level to the low huts of the native lines on the other side      so the doctor comes back tomorrow  major   the adjutant  who had been  one of the whist party  said   i shall be very glad to have him back   in the first place  he is a capital fellow  and keeps us all alive   secondly  he is a good deal better doctor than the station surgeon who  has been looking after the men since we have been here  and lastly  if  i had got anything the matter with me myself  i would rather be in his  hands than those of anyone else i know       yes  i agree with you  prothero  the doctor is as good a fellow as ever  stepped  there is no doubt about his talent in his profession  and there  are a good many of us who owed our lives to him when we were down with  cholera  in that bad attack three years ago  he is good all round  he  is just as keen a shikari as he was when he joined the regiment   twenty years ago  he is a good billiard player  and one of the best  storytellers i ever came across  but his best point is that he is such a  thoroughly good fellow  always ready to do a good turn to anyone  and to  help a lame dog over a stile  i could name a dozen men in india who  owe their commissions to him  i don t know what the regiment would do  without him       he went home on leave just after i joined   one of the subalterns said    of course  i know  from all i have heard of him  that he is an awfully  good fellow  but from the little i saw of him myself  he seemed always  growling and snapping      there was a general laugh from the others      yes  that is his way  thompson   the major said   he believes himself  to be one of the most cynical and morose of men       he was married  wasn t he  major       yes  it was a sad business  it was only just after i joined  he is  three years senior to me in the regiment  he was appointed to it a month  or two after the colonel joined  well  as i say  a month or two after i  came to it  he went away on leave down to calcutta  where he was to meet  a young lady who had been engaged to him before he left home  they were  married  and he brought her up country  before she had been with us a  month we had one of those outbreaks of cholera  it wasn t a very severe  one  i think we only lost eight or ten men  and no officer  but the  doctor s young wife was attacked  and in three or four hours she was  carried off  it regularly broke him down  however  he got over it  as  we all do  i suppose  and now i think he is married to the regiment  he  could have had staff appointments a score of times  but he has always  refused them  his time is up next year  and he could go home on full  pay  but i don t suppose he will       and your niece arrives with him tomorrow  major   the adjutant said      yes  i am going to try petticoat government  prothero  i don t know how  the experiment will succeed  but i am tired of an empty bungalow  and i  have been looking forward for some years to her being old enough to come  out and take charge  it is ten years since i was home  and she was a  little chit of eight years old at that time       i think a vote of thanks ought to be passed to you  major  we have only  married ladies in the regiment  and it will wake us up and do us good to  have miss hannay among us       there are the colonel s daughters   the major said  with a smile      yes  there are  major  but they hardly count  they are scarcely  conscious of the existence of poor creatures like us  nothing short of a  resident or  at any rate  of a full blown collector  will find favor in  their eyes       well  i warn you all fairly   the major said   that i shall set my  face against all sorts of philandering and love making  i am bringing my  niece out here as my housekeeper and companion  and not as a prospective  wife for any of you youngsters  i hope she will turn out to be as plain  as a pikestaff  and then i may have some hopes of keeping her with me  for a time  the doctor  in his letter from calcutta  says nothing as to  what she is like  though he was good enough to remark that she seemed to  have a fair share of common sense  and has given him no more trouble  on the voyage than was to be expected under the circumstances  and now   lads  it is nearly two o clock  and as there is early parade tomorrow   it is high time for you to be all in your beds  what a blessing it would  be if the sun would forget to shine for a bit on this portion of the  world  and we could have an arctic night of seven or eight months with a  full moon the whole time      a few minutes later the messroom was empty  the lights turned out  and  the servants wrapped up in their blankets had disposed themselves for  sleep in the veranda     as soon as morning parade was over major hannay went back to his  bungalow  looked round to see that his bachelor quarters were as bright  and tidy as possible  then got into a light suit and went down to the  post house  a quarter of an hour later a cloud of dust along the road  betokened the approach of the dak gharry  and two or three minutes later  it dashed up at full gallop amid a loud and continuous cracking of the  driver s whip  the wiry little horses were drawn up with a sudden jerk     the major opened the door  a little man sprang out and grasped him by  the hand      glad to see you  major  thoroughly glad to be back again  here is your  niece  i deliver her safe and sound into your hands   and between them  they helped a girl to alight from the vehicle      i am heartily glad to see you  my dear   the major said  as he kissed  her   though i don t think i should have known you again       i should think not  uncle   the girl said   in the first place  i was  a little girl in short frocks when i saw you last  and in the second  place  i am so covered with the dust that you can hardly see what i  am like  i think i should have known you  your visit made a great  impression upon us  though i can remember now how disappointed we were  when you first arrived that you hadn t a red coat and a sword  as we had  expected       well  we may as well be off at once  isobel  it is only five minutes   walk to the bungalow  my man will see to your luggage being brought up   come along  doctor  of course you will put up with me until you can look  round and fix upon quarters  i told rumzan to bring your things round  with my niece s  you have had a very pleasant voyage out  i hope   isobel   he went on  as they started      very pleasant  uncle  though i got rather tired of it at last       that is generally the way  everyone is pleasant and agreeable at first   but before they get to the end they take to quarreling like cats and  dogs       we were not quite as bad as that   the girl laughed   but we certainly  weren t as amiable the last month or so as we were during the first  part of the voyage  still  it was very pleasant all along  and nobody  quarreled with me       present company are always excepted   the doctor said   i stood in loco  parentis  major  and the result has been that i shall feel in future  more charitable towards mothers of marriageable daughters  still  i am  bound to say that miss hannay has given me as little trouble as could be  expected       you frighten me  doctor  if you found her so onerous only for a voyage   what have i to look forward to       well  you can t say that i didn t warn you  major  when you wrote home  and asked me to take charge of your niece on the way out  i told you  frankly that my opinion of your good sense was shaken       yes  you did express yourself with some strength   the major laughed    but then one is so accustomed to that  that i did not take it to heart  as i might otherwise have done       that was before you knew me  dr  wade  otherwise i should feel very  hurt   the girl put in      yes  it was   the doctor said dryly      don t mind him  my dear   her uncle said   we all know the doctor of  old  this is my bungalow       it is pretty  with all these flowers and shrubs round it   she said  admiringly      yes  we have been doing a good deal of watering the last few weeks  so  as to get it to look its best  this is your special attendant  she will  take you up to your room  by the time you have had a bath  your boxes  will be here  i told them to have a cup of tea ready for you upstairs   breakfast will be on the table by the time you are ready       well  old friend   he said to the doctor  when the girl had gone  upstairs   no complications  i hope  on the voyage       no  i think not   the doctor said   of course  there were lots of young  puppies on board  and as she was out and out the best looking girl in  the ship half of them were dancing attendance upon her all the voyage   but i am bound to say that she acted like a sensible young woman   and though she was pleasant with them all  she didn t get into any  flirtation with one more than another  i did my best to look after her   but  of course  that would have been of no good if she had been disposed  to go her own way  i fancy about half of them proposed to her  not that  she ever said as much to me  but whenever i observed one looking sulky  and giving himself airs i could guess pretty well what had happened   these young puppies are all alike  and we are not without experience of  the species out here      seriously  major  i think you are to be congratulated  i consider that  you ran a tremendous risk in asking a young woman  of whom you knew  nothing  to come out to you  still it has turned out well  if she had  been a frivolous  giggling thing  like most of them  i had made up my  mind to do you a good turn by helping to get her engaged on the voyage   and should have seen her married offhand at calcutta  and have come up  and told you that you were well out of the scrape  as  contrary to my  expectations  she turned out to be a sensible young woman  i did my best  the other way  it is likely enough you may have her on your hands some  little time  for i don t think she is likely to be caught by the first  comer  well  i must go and have my bath  the dust has been awful coming  up from allahabad  that is one advantage  and the only one as far as  i can see  that they have got in england  they don t know what dust is  there      when the bell for breakfast rang  and isobel made her appearance   looking fresh and cool  in a light dress  the major said   you must  take the head of the table  my dear  and assume the reins of government  forthwith       then i should say  uncle  that if any guidance is required  there will  be an upset in a very short time  no  that won t do at all  you must go  on just as you were before  and i shall look on and learn  as far as i  can see  everything is perfect just as it is  this is a charming room   and i am sure there is no fault to be found with the arrangement of  these flowers on the table  as for the cooking  everything looks very  nice  and anyhow  if you have not been able to get them to cook to your  taste  it is of no use my attempting anything in that way  besides  i  suppose i must learn something of the language before i can attempt to  do anything  no  uncle  i will sit in this chair if you like  and  make tea and pour it out  but that is the beginning and the end of my  assumption of the head of the establishment at present       well  isobel  i hardly expected that you were going to run the  establishment just at first  indeed  as far as that goes  one s butler   if he is a good man  has pretty well a free hand  he is generally  responsible  and is in fact what we should call at home housekeeper  he  and the cook between them arrange everything  i say to him   three  gentlemen are coming to tiffen   he nods and says  atcha  sahib   which  means  all right  sir   and then i know it will be all right  if i have  a fancy for any special thing  of course i say so  otherwise  i leave it  to them  and if the result is not satisfactory  i blow up  nothing can  be more simple       but how about bills  uncle       well  my dear  the butler gives them to me  and i pay them  he has been  with me a good many years  and will not let the others  that is to  say  the cook and the syce  the washerman  and so on  cheat me beyond a  reasonable amount  do you  rumzan      rumzan  who was standing behind the major s chair  in a white turban and  dress  with a red and white sash round his waist  smiled      rumzan not let anyone rob his master       not to any great extent  you know  rumzan  one doesn t expect more than  that       it is just the same here  miss hannay  as it is everywhere else    said the doctor   only in big establishments in england they rob you of  pounds  while here they rob you of annas  which  as i have explained to  you  are two pence halfpennies  the person who undertakes to put down  little peculations enters upon a war in which he is sure to get the  worst of it  he wastes his time  spoils his temper  makes himself and  everyone around him uncomfortable  and after all he is robbed  life is  too short for it  especially in a climate like this  of course  in time  you get to understand the language  if you see anything in the bills  that strikes you as showing waste you can go into the thing  but as a  rule you trust entirely to your butler  if you cannot trust him  get  another one  rumzan has been with your uncle ten years  so you are  fortunate  if the major had gone home instead of me  and if you had  had an entirely fresh establishment of servants to look after  the case  would have been different  as it is  you will have no trouble that way       then what are my duties to be  uncle       your chief duties  my dear  are to look pleasant  which will evidently  be no trouble to you  to amuse me and keep me in a good temper as far  as possible  to keep on as good terms as may be with the other ladies of  the station  and  what will perhaps be the most difficult part of your  work  to snub and keep in order the young officers of our own and other  corps      isobel laughed   that doesn t sound a very difficult programme  uncle   except the last item  i have already had a little experience that way   haven t i  doctor  i hope i shall have the benefit of your assistance in  the future  as i had aboard the ship       i will do my best   the doctor said grimly   but the british subaltern  is pretty well impervious to snubs  he belongs to the pachydermatous  family of animals  his armor of self conceit renders him invulnerable  against the milder forms of raillery  however  i think you can be  trusted to hold your own with him  miss hannay  without much assistance  from the major or myself  your real difficulty will lie rather in your  struggle against the united female forces of the station       but why shall i have to struggle with them   isobel asked  in surprise   while her uncle broke into a laugh      don t frighten her  doctor       she is not so easily frightened  major  it is just as well that she  should be prepared  well  my dear miss hannay  indian society has this  peculiarity  that the women never grow old  at least   he continued   in reply to the girl s look of surprise   they are never conscious  of growing old  at home a woman s family grows up about her  and are  constant reminders that she is becoming a matron  here the children are  sent away when they get four or five years old  and do not appear on the  scene again until they are grown up  then  too  ladies are greatly in  the minority  and they are accustomed to be made vastly more of than  they are at home  and the consequence is that the amount of envy   hatred  jealousy  and all uncharitableness is appalling       no  no  doctor  not as bad as that   the major remonstrated      every bit as bad as that   the doctor said stoutly   i am not a woman  hater  far from it  but i have felt sometimes that if john company   in its beneficence  would pass a decree absolutely excluding the  importation of white women into india it would be an unmixed blessing       for shame  doctor   isobel hannay said   and to think that i should  have such a high opinion of you up to now       i can t help it  my dear  my experience is that for ninety nine out of  every hundred unpleasantnesses that take place out here  women are in  one way or another responsible  they get up sets and cliques  and break  up what might be otherwise pleasant society into sections  talk about  caste amongst natives  it is nothing to the caste among women out  here  the wife of a civilian of high rank looks down upon the wives of  military men  the general s wife looks down upon a captain s  and so  right through from the top to the bottom      it is not so among the men  or at any rate to a very much smaller  extent  of course  some men are pompous fools  but  as a rule  if two  men meet  and both are gentlemen  they care nothing as to what their  respective ranks may be  a man may be a lord or a doctor  a millionaire  or a struggling barrister  but they meet on equal terms in society  but  out here it is certainly not so among the women  they stand upon  their husband s dignity in a way that would be pitiable if it were not  exasperating  of course  there are plenty of good women among them  as  there are everywhere  women whom even india can t spoil  but what with  exclusiveness  and with the amount of admiration and adulation they get   and what with the want of occupation for their thoughts and minds  it is  very hard for them to avoid getting spoilt       well  i hope i shan t get spoilt  doctor  and i hope  if you see that i  am getting spoilt  you will make a point of telling me so at once      the doctor grunted   theoretically  people are always ready to receive  good advice  miss hannay  practically they are always offended by  it  however  in your case i will risk it  and i am bound to say that  hitherto you have proved yourself more amenable in that way than most  young women i have come across       and now  if we have done  we will go out on the veranda   the major  said   i am sure the doctor must be dying for a cheroot       the doctor has smoked pretty continuously since we left allahabad    isobel said   he wanted to sit up with the driver  but  of course  i  would not have that  i had got pretty well accustomed to smoke coming  out  and even if i had not been i would much rather have been almost  suffocated than have been in there by myself  i thought a dozen times  the vehicle was going to upset  and what with the bumping and the  shouting and the cracking of the whip  especially when the horses  wouldn t start  which was generally the case at first  i should have  been frightened out of my life had i been alone  it seemed to me that  something dreadful was always going to happen       you can take it easy this morning  isobel   the major said  when they  were comfortably seated in the bamboo lounges in the veranda   you want  have any callers today  as it will be known you traveled all night   people will imagine that you want a quiet day before you are on show       what a horrid expression  uncle       well  my dear  it represents the truth  the arrival of a fresh lady  from england  especially of a  spin   which is short for spinster or  unmarried woman  is an event of some importance in an indian station   not  of course  so much in a place like this  because this is the center  of a large district  but in a small station it is an event of the first  importance  the men are anxious to see what a newcomer is like for  herself  the women  to look at her dresses and see the latest fashions  from home  and also to ascertain whether she is likely to turn out a  formidable rival  however  today you can enjoy quiet  tomorrow you  must attire yourself in your most becoming costume  and i will trot you  round       trot me round  uncle       yes  my dear  in india the order of procedure is reversed  and  newcomers call in the first place upon residents       what a very unpleasant custom  uncle  especially as some of the  residents may not want to know them       well  everyone must know everyone else in a station  my dear  though  they may not wish to be intimate  so  about half past one tomorrow we  will start       what  in the heat of the day  uncle       yes  my dear  that is another of the inscrutable freaks of indian  fashion  the hours for calling are from about half past twelve to half  past two  just in the hottest hours  i don t pretend to account for it       how many ladies are there in the regiment       there is the colonel s wife  mrs  cromarty  she has two grown up red  headed girls   replied the doctor   she is a distant relation  a second  cousin  of some scotch lord or other  and  on the strength of that and  her husband s colonelcy  gives herself prodigious airs  three of the  captains are married  mrs  doolan is a merry little irish woman  you  will like her  she has two or three children  she is a general favorite  in the regiment      mrs  rintoul  i suppose she is here still  major  and unchanged  ah  i  thought so  she is a washed out woman  without a spark of energy in her  composition    she believes that she is a chronic invalid  and sends  for me on an average once a week  but there is nothing really the matter  with her  if she would but only believe it  mrs  roberts        don t be ill natured  doctor   the major broke in   mrs  roberts  my  dear  is a good looking woman  and a general flirt  i don t think there  is any harm in her whatever  mrs  prothero  the adjutant s wife  has  only been out here eighteen months  and is a pretty little woman  and in  all respects nice  there is only one other  mrs  scarsdale  she came out  six months ago  she is a quiet young woman  with  i should say  plenty  of common sense  i should think you will like her  that completes the  regimental list       well  that is not so very formidable  anyhow  it is a  comfort that we  shall have no one here today       you will have the whole regiment here in a few minutes  isobel  but  they will be coming to see the doctor  not you  if it hadn t been that  they knew you were under his charge everyone would have come down to  meet him when he arrived  but if you feel tired  as i am sure you must  be after your journey  there is no reason why you shouldn t go and lie  down quietly for a few hours       i will stop here  uncle  it will be much less embarrassing to see them  all for the first time when they come to see dr  wade and i am quite a  secondary consideration  than if they had to come specially to call on  me       well  i agree with you there  my dear  ah  here come doolan and  prothero      a light trap drove into the inclosure and drew up in front of the  veranda  and two officers jumped down  whilst the syce  who had been  standing on a step behind  ran to the horse s head  they hailed the  doctor  as he stepped out from the veranda  with a shout      glad to see you back  doctor  the regiment has not seemed like itself  without you       we have been just pining without you  doctor   captain doolan said    and the ladies would have got up a deputation to meet you on your  arrival  only i told them that it would be too much for your modesty       well  it is a good thing that someone has a little of that quality in  the regiment  doolan   the doctor said  as he shook hands heartily with  them both   it is very little of it that fell to the share of ireland  when it was served out      as they dropped the doctor s hand the major said   now  gentlemen  let  me introduce you to my niece   the introductions were made  and the  whole party took chairs on the veranda      do you object to smoking  miss hannay  perhaps you have not got  accustomed to it yet  i see the doctor is smoking  but then he is a  privileged person  altogether beyond rule       i rather like it in the open air   isobel said   no doubt i shall get  accustomed to it indoors before long      in a few minutes four or five more of the officers arrived  and isobel  sat an amused listener to the talk  taking but little part in it  herself  but gathering a good deal of information as to the people at  the station from the answers given to the doctor s inquiries  it was  very much like the conversation on board ship  except that the topics of  conversation were wider and more numerous  and there was a community  of interest wanting on board a ship  in half an hour  however  the  increasing warmth and her sleepless night began to tell upon her  and  her uncle  seeing that she was beginning to look fagged  said   the best  thing that you can do  isobel  is to go indoors for a bit  and have a  good nap  at five o clock i will take you round for a drive  and show  you the sights of cawnpore       i do feel sleepy   she said   though it sounds rude to say so       not at all   the doctor put in   if any of these young fellows had made  the journey out from allahabad in that wretched gharry  they would have  turned into bed as soon as they arrived  and would not have got up till  the first mess bugle sounded  and very likely would have slept on until  next morning      now   he went on  when isobel had disappeared   we will adjourn with  you to the mess house  that young lady would have very small chance of  getting to sleep with all this racket here  doolan s voice alone would  banish sleep anywhere within a distance of a hundred yards       i will join you there later  doctor   the major said   i have got a  couple of hours  work in the orderly room  rumzan  don t let my niece be  disturbed  but if she wakes and rings the bell send up a message by the  woman that i shall not be back until four      the major walked across to the orderly room  while the rest  mounting  their buggies  drove to the mess house  which was a quarter of a mile  away      i should think miss hannay will prove a valuable addition to our  circle  doctor   the adjutant said   i don t know why  but i gathered  from what the major said that his niece was very young  he spoke of her  as if she were quite a child       she is a very nice  sensible young woman   the doctor said   clever and  bright  and  as you can see for your selves  pretty  and yet no nonsense  about her  i only hope that she won t get spoilt here  nineteen out of  twenty young women do get spoilt within six months of their arrival in  india  but i think she will be one of the exceptions       i should have liked to have seen the doctor doing chaperon   captain  doolan laughed   he would have been a brave man who would have attempted  even the faintest flirtation with anyone under his charge       that is your opinion  is it  doolan   the doctor said sharply   i  should have thought that even your common sense would have told you that  anyone who has had the misfortune to see as much of womankind as i have  would have been aware that any endeavor to check a flirtation for which  they are inclined would be of all others the way to induce them to go in  for it headlong  you are a married man yourself  and ought to know that   a woman is a good deal like a spirited horse  let her have her head   and  though she may for a time make the pace pretty fast  she will go  straight  and settle down to her collar in time  whereas if you keep a  tight curb she will fret and fidget  and as likely as not make a  bolt for it  i can assure you that my duties were of the most nominal  description  there were the usual number of hollow pated lads on board   who buzzed in their usual feeble way round miss hannay  and were one  after another duly snubbed  miss hannay has plenty of spirits  and a  considerable sense of humor  and i think that she enjoyed the voyage  thoroughly  and now let us talk of something else      after an hour s chat the doctor started on his round of calls upon the  ladies  the major had not come in from the orderly room  and  after the  doctor left  isobel hannay was again the topic of conversation      she is out and out the prettiest girl in the station   the adjutant  said to some of the officers who had not seen her   she will make quite  a sensation  and there are five or six ladies in the station  whose  names i need hardly mention  who will not be very pleased at her coming   she is thoroughly in good form  too  nothing in the slightest degree  fast or noisy about her  she is quiet and self possessed  i fancy she  will be able to hold her own against any of them  clever  i should say   certainly   but  of course  that is from her face rather than from  anything she said  i expect half the unmarried men in the station will  be going wild over her  you need not look so interested  wilson  the  matter is of no more personal interest to you than if i were describing  a new comet  nothing less than a big civilian is likely to carry off  such a prize  so i warn you beforehand you had better not be losing your  heart to her       well  you know  prothero  subalterns do manage to get wives sometimes      there was a laugh      that is true enough  wilson  but then  you see  i married at home   besides  i am adjutant  which sounds a lot better than subaltern       that may go for a good deal in the regiment   wilson retorted   but  i doubt if there are many women that know the difference between  an adjutant and a quartermaster  they know about colonels  majors   captains  and even subalterns  but if you were to say that you were an  adjutant they would be simply mystified  though they might understand if  you said bandmaster  but i fancy sergeant major would sound ever so much  more imposing       wilson  if you are disrespectful  i shall discover tomorrow  on parade   that no    company wants a couple of hours  extra drill badly  and then  you will feel how grievous a mistake it is to cheek an adjutant      the report of those who had called at the major s was so favorable that  curiosity was quite roused as to the new comer  and when the major drove  round with her the next day everyone was at home  and the verdict on  the part of the ladies was generally favorable  but was by no means so  unqualified as that of the gentlemen     mrs  cromarty admitted that she was nice looking  but was critical as  to her carriage and manner  she would be admired by young officers  no  doubt  but there was too much life and animation about her  and although  she would not exactly say that she stooped  she was likely to do so in  time      she will be nothing remarkable when her freshness has worn off a  little      in this opinion the misses cromarty thoroughly assented  they had never  been accused of stooping  and  indeed  were almost painfully upright   and were certainly not particularly admired by subalterns     mrs  doolan was charmed with her  and told her she hoped that they would  be great friends      this is a very pleasant life out here  my dear   she said   if one does  but take it in the right way  there is a great deal of tittle tattle in  the indian stations  and some quarreling  but  you know  it takes two to  make a quarrel  and i make it a point never to quarrel with anyone  it  is too hot for it  then  you see  i have the advantage of being irish   and  for some reason or other that i don t understand we can say pretty  nearly what we like  people don t take us seriously  you know  so i keep  in with them all      mrs  rintoul received her visitors on the sofa   it is quite refreshing  to see a face straight from england  miss hannay  i only hope that you  may keep your bright color and healthy looks  some people do  not their  color  but their health  unfortunately i am not one of them  i do not  know what it is to have a day s health  the climate completely oppresses  me  and i am fit for nothing  you would hardly believe that i was as  strong and healthy as you are when i first came out  you came out with  dr  wade  a clever man  i have a very high opinion of his talent  but my  case is beyond him  it is a sad annoyance to him that it is so  and  he is continually trying to make me believe that there is nothing the  matter with me  as if my looks did not speak for themselves      mrs  rintoul afterwards told her husband she could hardly say that she  liked miss hannay      she is distressingly brisk and healthy  and i should say  my dear  not  of a sympathetic nature  which is always a pity in a young woman      after this somewhat depressing visit  the call upon mrs  roberts was a  refreshing one  she received her very cordially      i like you  miss hannay   she said  when  after a quarter of an hour s  lively talk  the major and his niece got up to go   i always say what i  think  and it is very good natured of me to say so  for i don t disguise  from myself that you will put my nose out of joint       i don t want to put anyone s nose out of joint   isobel laughed      you will do it  whether you want to or not   mrs  roberts said   my  husband as much as told me so last night  and i was prepared not to like  you  but i see that i shall not be able to help doing so  major hannay   you have dealt me a heavy blow  but i forgive you      when the round of visits was finished the major said   well  isobel   what do you think of the ladies of the regiment       i think they are all very nice  uncle  i fancy i shall like mrs   doolan and mrs  scarsdale best  i won t give any opinion yet about mrs   cromarty          chapter iv       the life of isobel hannay had not  up to the time when she left england  to join her uncle  been a very bright one  at the death of her father   her mother had been left with an income that enabled her to live  as she  said  genteelly  at brighton  she had three children  the eldest a  girl of twelve  isobel  who was eight  and a boy of five  who was sadly  deformed  the result of a fall from the arms of a careless nurse when  he was an infant  it was at that time that major hannay had come home on  leave  having been left trustee and executor  and seen to all the money  arrangements  and had established his brother s widow at brighton  the  work had not been altogether pleasant  for mrs  hannay was a selfish and  querulous woman  very difficult to satisfy even in little matters  and  with a chronic suspicion that everyone with whom she came in contact  was trying to get the best of her  her eldest girl was likely  captain  hannay thought  to take after her mother  whose pet she was  while  isobel took after her father  he had suggested that both should be sent  to school  but mrs  hannay would not hear of parting from helena  but  was willing enough that isobel should be sent to a boarding school at  her uncle s expense     as the years went by  helena grew up  as mrs  hannay proudly said  the  image of what she herself had been at her age  tall and fair  indolent  and selfish  fond of dress and gayety  discontented because their means  would not permit them to indulge in either to the fullest extent  there  was nothing in common between her and her sister  who  when at home  for the holidays  spent her time almost entirely with her brother  who  received but slight attention from anyone else  his deformity being  considered as a personal injury and affliction by his mother and elder  sister      you could not care less for him   isobel once said  in a fit of  passion   if he were a dog  i don t think you notice him more  not one  bit  he wanders about the house without anybody to give a thought to  him  i call it cruel  downright cruel       you are a wicked girl  isobel   her mother said angrily   a wicked   violent girl  and i don t know what will become of you  it is abominable  of you to talk so  even if you are wicked enough to get into a passion   what can we do for him that we don t do  what is the use of talking to  him when he never pays attention to what we say  and is always moping  i  am sure we get everything that we think will please him  and he goes out  for a walk with us every day  what could possibly be done more for him       a great deal more might be done for him   isobel burst out   you might  love him  and that would be everything to him  i don t believe you and  helena love him  not one bit  not one tiny scrap       go up to your room  isobel  and remain there for the rest of the day   you are a very bad girl  i shall write to miss virtue about you  there  must be something very wrong in her management of you  or you would  never be so passionate and insolent as you are      but isobel had not stopped to hear the last part of the sentence  the  door had slammed behind her  she was not many minutes alone upstairs   for robert soon followed her up  for when she was at home he rarely left  her side  watching her every look and gesture with eyes as loving as  those of a dog  and happy to sit on the ground beside her  with his head  leaning against her  for hours together     mrs  hannay kept her word and wrote to miss virtue  and the evening  after she returned to school isobel was summoned to her room      i am sorry to say  i have a very bad account of you from your mother   she says you are a passionate and wicked girl  how is it  dear  you are  not passionate here  and i certainly do not think you are wicked       i can t help it when i am at home  miss virtue  i am sure i try to  be good  but they won t let me  they don t like me because i can t be  always tidy and what they call prettily behaved  and because i hate  walking on the parade and being stuck up and unnatural  and they don t  like me because i am not pretty  and because i am thin and don t look   as mamma says  a credit to her  but it is not that so much as because  of robert  you know he is deformed  miss virtue  and they don t care for  him  and he has no one to love him but me  and it makes me mad to see  him treated so  that is what it was she wrote about  i told her they  treated him like a dog and so they do   and she burst into tears      but that was very naughty  isobel   miss virtue said gravely   you are  only eleven years old  and too young to be a judge of these matters   and even if it were as you say  it is not for a child to speak so to her  mother       i know that  miss virtue  but how can i help it  i could cry out with  pain when i see robert looking from one to the other just for a kind  word  which he never gets  it is no use  miss virtue  if it was not for  him i would much rather never go home at all  but stop here through  the holidays  only what would he do if i didn t go home  i am the only  pleasure he has  when i am there he will sit for hours on my knee  and  lay his head on my shoulder  and stroke my face  it makes me feel as if  my heart would break       well  my dear   miss virtue said  somewhat puzzled   it is sad  if it  is as you say  but that does not excuse your being disrespectful to your  mother  it is not for you to judge her       but cannot something be done for robert  miss virtue  surely they must  do something for children like him       there are people  my dear  who take a few afflicted children and give  them special training  children of that kind have sometimes shown a  great deal of unusual talent  and  if so  it is cultivated  and they are  put in a way of earning a livelihood       are there   isobel exclaimed  with eager eyes   then i know what i  will do  miss virtue  i will write off at once to uncle tom  he is  our guardian  i know if i were to speak to mamma about robert going to  school it would be of no use  but if uncle writes i dare say it would be  done  i am sure she and helena would be glad enough  i don t suppose she  ever thought of it  it would be a relief to them to get him out of their  sight      miss virtue shook her head   you must not talk so  isobel  it is not  right or dutiful  and you are a great deal too young to judge your  elders  even if they were not related to you  and  pray  if you write to  your uncle do not write in that spirit  it would shock him greatly  and  he would form a very bad opinion of you      and so isobel wrote  she was in the habit of writing once every half  year to her uncle  who had told her that he wished her to do so  and  that people out abroad had great pleasure in letters from england   hitherto she had only written about her school life  and this letter  caused her a great deal of trouble     it answered its purpose  captain hannay had no liking either for his  sister in law or his eldest niece  and had  when he was with them  been  struck with the neglect with which the little boy was treated  isobel  had taken great pains not to say anything that would show she considered  that robert was harshly treated  but had simply said that she heard  there were schools where little boys like him could be taught  and that  it would be such a great thing for him  as it was very dull for him  having nothing to do all day  but captain hannay read through the lines   and felt that it was a protest against her brother s treatment  and that  she would not have written to him had she not felt that so only would  anything be done for him  accordingly he wrote home to his sister in  law  saying he thought it was quite time now that the boy should be  placed with some gentleman who took a few lads unfitted for the rough  life of an ordinary school  he should take the charges upon himself  and  had written to his agent in london to find out such an establishment   to make arrangements for robert to go there  and to send down one of his  clerks to take charge of him on the journey  he also wrote to isobel   telling her what he had done  and blaming himself for not having thought  of it before  winding up by saying   i have not mentioned to your mother  that i heard from you about it  that is a little secret just as well to  keep to ourselves      the next five years were much happier to isobel  for the thought of her  brother at home without her had before been constantly on her mind  it  was a delight to her now to go home and to see the steady improvement  that took place in robert  he was brighter in every respect  and  expressed himself as most happy where he was     as years went on he grew into a bright and intelligent boy  though his  health was by no means good  and he looked frail and delicate  he was as  passionately attached to her as ever  and during the holidays they  were never separated  they stood quite alone  their mother and sister  interesting themselves but little in their doings  and they were allowed  to take long walks together  and to sit in a room by themselves  where  they talked  drew  painted  and read     mrs  hannay disapproved of isobel as much as ever   she is a most  headstrong girl   she would lament to her friends   and is really quite  beyond my control  i do not at all approve of the school she is at  but  unfortunately my brother in law  who is her guardian  has  under the  will of my poor husband  absolute control in the matter  i am sure poor  john never intended that he should be able to override my wishes  but  though i have written to him several times about it  he says that he  sees no valid reason for any change  and that from isobel s letters to  him she seems very happy there  and to be getting on well  she is so  very unlike dear helena  and even when at home i see but little of her   she is completely wrapped up in her unfortunate brother  of course i  don t blame her for that  but it is not natural that a girl her age  should care nothing for pleasures or going out or the things natural to  young people  yes  she is certainly improving in appearance  and if she  would but take some little pains about her dress would be really very  presentable      but her mother s indifference disturbed isobel but little  she was  perfectly happy with her brother when at home  and very happy at school   where she was a general favorite  she was impulsive  high spirited   and occasionally gave miss virtue some trouble  but her disposition  was frank and generous  there was not a tinge of selfishness in her  disposition  and while she was greatly liked by girls of her own age   she was quite adored by little ones  the future that she always pictured  to herself was a little cottage with a bright garden in the suburbs of  london  where she and robert could live together  she would go out as a  daily governess  robert  who was learning to play the organ  would   she hoped  get a post as organist  not  of course  for the sake of the  salary  for her earnings  and the interest of the thousand pounds that  would be hers when she came of age  would be sufficient for them both   but as an amusement for him  and to give him a sense of independence     but when she was just seventeen  and was looking forward to the time  when she would begin to carry her plan into effect  a terrible blow  came  she heard from her mother that robert was dead      it is a sad blow for us all   mrs  hannay wrote   but  as you know  he  has never been strong  still  we had no idea that anything serious ailed  him until we heard a fortnight since he was suffering from a violent  cough and had lost strength rapidly  a week later we heard that the  doctors were of opinion it was a case of sudden consumption  and that  the end was rapidly approaching  i went up to town to see him  and found  him even worse than i expected  and was in no way surprised when this  morning i received a letter saying that he had gone  great as is the  blow  one cannot but feel that  terribly afflicted as he was  his death  is  as far as he is concerned  a happy release  i trust you will now  abandon your wild scheme of teaching and come home      but home was less home than ever to isobel now  and she remained another  six months at school  when she received an important letter from her  uncle      my dear isobel  when you first wrote to me and told me that what you  were most looking forward to was to make a home for your brother  i own  that it was a blow to me  for i had long had plans of my own about you   however  i thought your desire to help your brother was so natural  and  would give you such happiness in carrying it into effect  that i at once  fell in with it and put aside my own plan  but the case is altered now   and i can see no reason why i cannot have my own way  when i was in  england i made up my mind that unless i married  which was a most  improbable contingency  i would  when you were old enough  have you  out to keep house for me  i foresaw  even then  that your brother might  prove an obstacle to this plan  even in the short time i was with you  it was easy enough to see that the charge of him would fall on your  shoulders  and that it would be a labor of love to you      if he lived  then  i felt you would not leave him  and that you would  be right in not doing so  but even then it seemed likely to me that  he would not grow up to manhood  from time to time i have been in  correspondence with the clergyman he was with  and learned that the  doctor who attended them thought but poorly of him  i had him taken  to two first class physicians in london  they pronounced him to be  constitutionally weak  and said that beyond strengthening medicines and  that sort of thing they could do nothing for him      therefore  dear  it was no surprise to me when i received first your  mother s letter with the news  and then your own written a few days  later  when i answered that letter i thought it as well not to say  anything of my plan  but by the time you receive this  it will be six  months since your great loss  and you will be able to look at it in a  fairer light than you could have done then  and i do hope you will agree  to come out to me  life here has its advantages and disadvantages  but i  think that  especially for young people  it is a pleasant one      i am getting very tired of a bachelor s establishment  and it will be a  very great pleasure indeed to have you here  ever since i was in england  i made up my mind to adopt you as my own child  you are very like my  brother john  and your letters and all i have heard of you show that you  have grown up just as he would have wished you to do  your sister helena  is your mother s child  and  without wishing to hurt your feelings  your  mother and i have nothing in common  i regard you as the only relation  i have in the world  and whether you come out or whether you do not   whatever i leave behind me will be yours  i do hope that you will at any  rate come out for a time  later on  if you don t like the life here  you  can fall back upon your own plan      if you decide to come  write to my agent  i inclose envelope addressed  to him  tell him when you can be ready  he will put you in the way of  the people you had better go to for your outfit  will pay all bills   take your passage  and so on      whatever you do  do not stint yourself  the people you go to will know  a great deal better than you can do what is necessary for a lady out  here  all you will have to do will be to get measured and to give them  an idea of your likes and fancies as to colors and so on  they will have  instructions from my agent to furnish you with a complete outfit  and  will know exactly how many dozens of everything are required      i can see no reason why you should not start within a month after the  receipt of this letter  and i shall look most anxiously for a letter  from you saying that you will come  and that you will start by a sailing  ship in a month at latest from the date of your writing      isobel did not hesitate  as her faith in her uncle was unbounded  next  to her meetings with her brother  his letters had been her greatest  pleasures  he had always taken her part  it was he who  at her request   had robert placed at school  and he had kept her at miss virtue s  in spite of her mother s complaints  at home she had never felt  comfortable  it had always seemed to her that she was in the way   her mother disapproved of her  while from helena she had never had a  sisterly word  to go out to india to see the wonders she had read of   and to be her uncle s companion  seemed a perfectly delightful prospect   her answer to her uncle was sent off the day after she received his  letter  and that day month she stepped on board an indiaman in the  london docks     the intervening time had not been a pleasant one  mrs  hannay had heard  from the major of his wishes and intentions regarding isobel  and she  was greatly displeased thereat      why should he have chosen you instead of helena   she said angrily to  isobel  on the first day of her arrival home      i suppose because he thought i should suit him better  mamma  i really  don t see why you should be upset about it  i don t suppose helena would  have liked to go  and i am sure you would not have liked to have had  me with you instead of her  i should have thought you would have been  pleased i was off your hands altogether  it doesn t seem to me that you  have ever been really glad to have me about you       that has been entirely your own fault   mrs  hannay said   you have  always been headstrong and determined to go your own way  you have never  been fit to be seen when anyone came  you have thwarted me in every  way       i am very sorry  mamma  i think i might have been better if you had had  a little more patience with me  but even now if you really wish me to  stay at home i will do so  i can write again to uncle and tell him that  i have changed my mind       certainly not   mrs  hannay said   naturally i should wish to have my  children with me  but i doubt whether your being here would be for the  happiness of any of us  and besides  i do not wish your uncle s money  to go out of the family  he might take it into his head to leave it to  a hospital for black women  still  it would have been only right and  proper that he should at any rate have given helena the first choice   as for your instant acceptance of his offer  without even consulting me   nothing can surprise me in that way after your general conduct towards  me      however  although mrs  hannay declined to take any interest in isobel s  preparations  and continued to behave as an injured person  neither she  nor helena were sorry at heart for the arrangement that had been  made  they objected very strongly to isobel s plan of going out as a  governess  but upon the other hand  her presence at home would in many  ways have been an inconvenience  two can make a better appearance on  a fixed income than three can  and her presence at home would have  necessitated many small economies  she was  too  a disturbing element   the others understood each other perfectly  and both felt that they in  no way understood isobel  altogether  it was much better that she should  go     as to the heirship  captain hannay had spoken freely as to his monetary  affairs when he had been in england after his brother s death      my pay is amply sufficient for all my wants   he said   but everything  is expensive out there  and i have had no occasion to save  i have a  few hundred pounds laid by  so that if i break down  and am ordered to  europe at any time on sick leave  i can live comfortably for that time   but  beyond that  there has been no reason why i should lay by  i am  not likely ever to marry  and when i have served my full time my pension  will be ample for my wants in england  but i shall do my best to help if  help is necessary  fortunately the interest of the thousand apiece the  girls were left by my aunt will help your income  when it is necessary  to do anything for robert  poor lad  i will take that expense on  myself       i thought all indians came home with lots of money   mrs  hannay said  complainingly      not the military  we do the fighting  and get fairly paid for it  the  civilians get five times as highly paid  and run no risks whatever  why  it should be so no one has ever attempted to explain  but there it is   sister      mrs  hannay  therefore  although she complained of the partiality shown  to isobel  was well aware that the major s savings could amount to no  very great sum  although  in nine years  with higher rank and better  pay  he might have added a good bit to the little store of which he had  spoken to her     when  a week before the vessel sailed  dr  wade appeared with a letter  he had received from the major  asking him to take charge of isobel on  the voyage  mrs  hannay conceived a violent objection to him  he had  in  fact  been by no means pleased with the commission  and had arrived in  an unusually aggressive and snappish humor  he cut short mrs  hannay s  well turned sentences ruthlessly  and aggrieved her by remarking on  helena s want of color  and recommending plenty of walking exercise  taken at a brisk pace  and more ease and comfort in the matter of dress      your daughter s lungs have no room to play  madam   he said   her  heart is compressed  no one can expect to be healthy under such  circumstances       i have my own medical attendant  dr  wade   mrs  hannay said decidedly      no doubt  madam  no doubt  all i can say is  if his recommendations  are not the same as mine  he must be a downright fool  very well  miss  hannay  i think we understand each other  i shall be on board by eleven  o clock  and shall keep a sharp lookout for you  don t be later than  twelve  she will warp out of the dock by one at latest  and if you miss  that your only plan will be to take the train down to tilbury  and hire  a boat there       i shall be in time  sir   isobel said      well  i hope you will  but my experience of women is pretty extensive   and i have scarcely met one who could be relied upon to keep an  appointment punctually  don t laden yourself more than you can help with  little bags  and parcels  and bundles of all kinds  i expect you will  be three or four in a cabin  and you will find that there is no room  for litter  take the things you will require at first in one or two  flat trunks which will stow under your berth  once a week or so  if the  weather is fine  you will be able to get at your things in the hold  do  try if possible to pack all the things that you are likely to want to  get at during the voyage in one trunk  and have a star or any mark  you like painted on that trunk with your name  then there will be no  occasion for the sailors to haul twenty boxes upon deck  be sure you  send all your trunks on board  except those you want in your cabin  two  days before she sails  do you think you can remember all that       i think so  dr  wade       very well then  i m off   and the doctor shook hands with isobel   nodded to mrs  hannay and helena  and hurried away      what a perfectly detestable little man   mrs  hannay exclaimed  as the  door closed over him   your uncle must have been out of his senses to  select such an odious person to look after you on the voyage  i really  pity you  isobel       i have no doubt he is very much nicer than he seems  mamma  uncle said   you know  in his letter last week  that he had written to dr  wade to  look after me  if  as he thought probable  he might be coming out in the  same ship  he said that he was a little brusque in his manner  but that  he was a general favorite  and one of the kindest hearted of men       a little brusque   mrs  hannay repeated scornfully   if he is only  considered a little brusque in india  all i can say is society must be  in a lamentable state out there       uncle says he is a great shikari  and has probably killed more tigers  than any man in india       i really don t see that that is any recommendation whatever  isobel   although it might be if you were likely to encounter tigers on board  ship  however  i am not surprised that your opinion differs from mine   we very seldom see matters in the same light  i only hope you may be  right and i may be wrong  for otherwise the journey is not likely to be  a very pleasant one for you  personally  i would almost as soon have  a bengal tiger loose about the ship than such a very rude  unmannerly  person as dr  wade      mrs  hannay and helena accompanied isobel to the docks  and went on  board ship with her     the doctor received them at the gangway  he was in a better temper  for  the fact that he was on the point of starting for india again had put  him in high spirits  he escorted the party below and saw that they got  lunch  showed isobel which was her cabin  introduced her to two or three  ladies of his acquaintance  and made himself so generally pleasant that  even mrs  hannay was mollified     as soon as luncheon was over the bell was rung  and the partings  were hurriedly got through  as the pilot announced that the tide  was slackening nearly half an hour before its time  and that it was  necessary to get the ship out of dock at once      now  miss hannay  if you will take my advice   the doctor said  as soon  as the ship was fairly in the stream   you will go below  get out all  the things you will want from your boxes  and get matters tidy and  comfortable  in the first place  it will do you good to be busy  and in  the second place  there is nothing like getting everything shipshape in  the cabin the very first thing after starting  then you are ready for  rough weather or anything else that may occur  i have got you a chair   i thought that very likely you would not think of it  and a passenger  without a chair of her own is a most forlorn creature  i can tell you   when you have done down below you will find me somewhere aft  if you  should not do so  look out for a chair with your own name on it and take  possession of it  but i think you are sure to see me      before they had been a fortnight at sea isobel came to like the doctor  thoroughly  he knew many of the passengers on board the byculla  and she  had soon many acquaintances  she was amused at the description that the  doctor gave her of some of the people to whom he introduced her      i am going to introduce you to that woman in the severely plain cloak  and ugly bonnet  she is the wife of the resident of rajputana  i knew  her when her husband was a collector       a collector  dr  wade  what did he collect       well  my dear  he didn t collect taxes or water rates or anything  of that sort  a collector is a civil functionary  and frequently  an important one  i used to attend her at one time when we were in  cantonments at bhurtpore  where her husband was stationed at that time   i pulled a tooth out for her once  and she halloaed louder than any  woman i ever heard  i don t mean to say  my dear  that woman holloa any  louder than men  on the contrary  they bear pain a good deal better   but she was an exception  she was twelve years younger then  and used  to dress a good deal more than she does now  that cloak and bonnet are  meant to convey to the rest of the passengers the fact that there is no  occasion whatever for a person of her importance to attend to such petty  matters as dress      she never mentions her husband s name without saying   my husband  the  resident   but for all that she is a kind hearted woman  a very kind  hearted woman  i pulled a child of hers through who was down with  fever at bhurtpore  he had a very close shave of it  and she has never  forgotten it  she greeted me when she came on board almost with tears  in her eyes at the thought of that time  i told her i had a young lady  under my charge  and she said that she would be very pleased to do  anything she could for you  she is a stanch friend is mrs  resident  and  you will find her useful before you get to the end of the voyage      the lady received isobel with genuine kindness  and took her very much  under her wing during the voyage  and isobel received no small advantage  from her advice and protection     her own good sense  however  and the earnest life she had led at school  and with her brother at home  would have sufficed her even without  this guardianship and that of the doctor  there was a straightforward  frankness about her that kept men from talking nonsense to her  a  compliment she simply laughed at  an attempt at flattery made her  angry  and the doctor afterwards declared to her uncle he would not have  believed that the guardianship of a girl upon the long indian voyage  could possibly have caused him so little trouble and annoyance      when i read your letter  major  my hair stood on end  and if my leave  had not been up i should have canceled my passage and come by the next  ship  and indeed when i went down to see her i had still by no means  made up my mind as to whether i would not take my chance of getting out  in time by the next vessel  however  i liked her appearance  and  as  i have said  it turned out excellently  and i should not mind making  another voyage in charge of her          chapter v       two days after his arrival at cawnpore dr  wade moved into quarters of  his own      i like dr  wade very much indeed  you know  uncle  still i am glad to  have you all to myself and to settle down into regular ways       yes  we have got to learn to know each other  isobel       do you think so  uncle  why  it seems to me that i know all about you   just the same as if we had always been together  and i am sure i always  told you all about myself  even when i was bad at school and got into  scrapes  because you said particularly that you liked me to tell you  everything  and did not want to know only the good side of me       yes  that is so  my dear  and no doubt i have a fair idea as to what  are your strong points and what are your weak ones  but neither one or  the other affect greatly a person s ordinary everyday character  it  is the little things  the trifles  the way of talking  the way of  listening  the amount of sympathy shown  and so on  that make a man  or woman popular  people do not ask whether he or she may be morally  sleeping volcanoes  who  if fairly roused  might slay a rival or burn  a city  they simply look at the surface  is a man or a woman pleasant   agreeable  easily pleased  ready to take a share in making things go   to show a certain amount of sympathy in other people s pleasures or  troubles  in fact  to form a pleasant unit of the society of a station      so in the house you might be the most angelic temper in the world  but  if you wore creaky boots  had a habit of slamming doors  little tricks  of giggling or fidgeting with your hands or feet  you would be an  unpleasant companion  for you would be constantly irritating one in  small matters  of course  it is just the same thing with your opinion of  me  you have an idea that i am a good enough sort of fellow  because i  have done my best to enable you to carry out your plans and wishes  but  that has nothing to do at all with my character as a man to live with   till we saw each other  when you got out of the gharry  we really knew  nothing whatever of each other      isobel shook her head decidedly      nothing will persuade me that i didn t know everything about you   uncle  you are just exactly what i knew you would be in look  and voice   in manner and ways and everything  of course  it is partly from what i  remember  but i really did not see a great deal of you in those days  it  is from your letters  i think  entirely that i knew all about you  and  exactly what you were  do you mean to say that i am not just what you  thought i should be       well  not so clearly as all that  isobel  of course you were only a  little child when i saw you  and except that you had big brown eyes  and  long eyelashes  i confess that it struck me that you were rather a  plain little thing  and i do not think that your mother s letters since  conveyed to my mind the fact that there had been any material change  since  therefore i own that you are personally quite different from what  i had expected to find you  i had expected to find you  i think  rather  stumpy in figure  and square in build  with a very determined and  businesslike manner       nonsense  uncle  you could not have expected that       well  my dear  i did  and you see i find i was utterly wrong       but you are not discontented  uncle   isobel asked  with a smile      no  my dear  but perhaps not quite so contented as you may think i  ought to be       why is that  uncle       well  my dear  if you had been what i had pictured you  i might have  had you four or five years to myself  possibly you might even have gone  home with me  to keep house for me in england  when i retire  as it is  now  i give myself six months at the outside       what nonsense  uncle  you don t suppose i am going to fall in love with  the first man who presents himself  why  everyone says the sea voyage is  a most trying time  and  you see  i came through that quite scathless      besides  uncle   and she laughed   there is safety in multitude  and  i think that a girl would be far more likely to fall in love in some  country place  where she only saw one or two men  than where there are  numbers of them  besides  it seems to me that in india a girl cannot  feel that she is chosen  as it were  from among other girls  as she  would do at home  there are so few girls  and so many men here  there  must be a sort of feeling that you are only appreciated because there is  nothing better to be had      but  of course  uncle  you can understand that the idea of love making  and marrying never entered my head at all until i went on board a  ship  as you know  i always used to think that robert and i would live  together  and i am quite sure that i should never have left him if he  had lived  if i had stopped in england i should have done the work i  had trained myself to do  and it might have been years and years  and  perhaps never  before anyone might have taken a fancy to me  or i to  him  it seems strange  and i really don t think pleasant  uncle  for  everyone to take it for granted that because a girl comes out to india  she is a candidate for marriage  i think it is degrading  uncle       the doctor was telling me yesterday that you had some idea of that  sort   the major said  with a slight smile   and i think girls often  start with that sort of idea  but it is like looking on at a game  you  don t feel interested in it until you begin to play at it  well  the  longer you entertain those ideas the better i shall be pleased  isobel   i only hope that you may long remain of the same mind  and that when  your time does come your choice will be a wise one      there could be no doubt that the major s niece was a great success in  the regiment  richards and wilson  two lads who had joined six months  before  succumbed at once  and mutual animosity succeeded the close  friendship they had hitherto entertained for each other  travers  the  senior captain  a man who had hitherto been noted for his indifference  to the charms of female society  went so far as to admit that miss  hannay was a very nice  unaffected girl  mrs  doolan was quite  enthusiastic about her      it is very lucky  jim   she said to her husband   that you were a sober  and respected married man before she came out  and that i am installed  here as your lawful and wedded wife instead of being at ballycrogin with  only an engagement ring on my finger  i know your susceptible nature   you would have fallen in love with her  and she would not have had you   and we should both of us have been miserable       how do you know she wouldn t have had me  norah       because  my dear  she will be able to pick and choose just where she  likes  and though no one recognizes your virtues more than i do  a  company in an indian regiment is hardly as attractive as a residency or  lieutenant governorship  but seriously  she is a dear girl  and as yet  does not seem to have the least idea how pretty she is  how cordially  some of them will hate her  i anticipate great fun in looking on  i am  out of all that sort of thing myself       that is news to me  norah  i think you are just as fond of a quiet  flirtation as you used to be       just of a very little one  jim  fortunately not more  so i can look  on complacently  but even i have suffered  why  for weeks not a day has  passed without young richards dropping in for a chat  and when he came  in yesterday he could talk about nothing but miss hannay  until i shut  him up by telling him it was extremely bad form to talk to one lady  about another  the boy colored up till i almost laughed in his face  in  fact  i believe i did laugh       that i will warrant you did  norah       i could not help it  especially when he assured me he was perfectly  serious about miss hannay       you did not encourage him  i hope  norah       no  i told him the colonel set his face against married subalterns  and  that he would injure himself seriously in his profession if he were to  think of such a thing  and as i knew he had nothing but his pay  that  would be fatal to him      captain doolan went off into a burst of laughter      and he took it all in  norah  he did not see that you were humbugging  him altogether       not a bit of it  they are very amusing  these boys  jim  i was really  quite sorry for richards  but i told him he would get over it in time   for as far as i could learn you had been just as bad thirty three times  before i finally took pity on you  and that i only did it then because  you were wearing away with your troubles  i advised him to put the best  face he could on it  for that miss hannay would be the last person to be  pleased  if he were to be going about with a face as long as if he had  just come from his aunt s funeral      the race meeting came off three weeks after miss hannay arrived at  cawnpore  she had been to several dinners and parties by this time  and  began to know most of the regular residents     the races served as an excuse for people to come in from all the  stations round  men came over from lucknow  agra  and allahabad  and  from many a little outlying station  every bungalow in the cantonment  was filled with guests  and tents were erected for the accommodation of  the overflow     several of the officers of the    d had horses and ponies entered in the  various races  there was to be a dance at the club on the evening of the  second day of the races  and a garden party at the general s on that  of the first  richards and wilson had both ponies entered for the  race confined to country tats which had never won a race  and both had  endeavored to find without success what was isobel s favorite color      but you must have some favorite color   wilson urged      why must i  mr  wilson  one thing is suitable for one thing and one  another  and i always like a color that is suitable for the occasion       but what color are you going to wear at the races  miss hannay       well  you see  i have several dresses   isobel said gravely   and i  cannot say until the morning arrives which i may wear  it will depend a  good deal how i feel  besides  i might object to your wearing the same  color as i do  you remember in the old times  knights  when they entered  the lists  wore the favors that ladies had given them  now i have no  idea of giving you a favor  you have done nothing worthy of it  when  you have won the victoria cross  and distinguished yourself by some  extraordinarily gallant action  it will be quite time to think about  it       you see one has to send one s color in four days beforehand  in time  for them to print it on the card   the lad said   and besides  one has  to get a jacket and cap made       but you don t reflect that it is quite possible your pony won t win  after all  and supposing that i had colors  i certainly should not like  to see them come in last in the race  mr  richards has been asking me  just the same thing  and  of course  i gave him the same answer  i can  only give you the advice i gave him       what was that  miss hannay   wilson asked eagerly      well  you see  it is not very long since either of you left school  so  i should think the best thing for you to wear are your school colors   whatever they were      and with a merry laugh at his look of discomfiture  isobel turned away  and joined mrs  doolan and two or three other ladies who were sitting  with her      there is one comfort   mrs  doolan was just saying   in this country   when there is anything coming off  there is no occasion to be anxious as  to the weather  one knows that it will be hot  fine  and dusty  one can  wear one s gayest dress without fear  in ireland one never knew whether  one wanted muslin or waterproof until the morning came  and even then  one could not calculate with any certainty how it would be by twelve  o clock  this will be your first indian festivity  miss hannay       do the natives come much       i should think so  all cawnpore will turn out  and we shall have the  lord of bithoor and any number of talookdars and zemindars with their  suites  a good many of them will have horses entered  and they have some  good ones if they could but ride them  the rajah of bithoor is a most  important personage  he talks english very well  and gives splendid  entertainments  he is a most polite gentleman  and is always over here  if there is anything going on  the general idea is that he has set his  mind on having an english wife  the only difficulty being our objection  to polygamy  he has every other advantage  and his wife would have  jewels that a queen might envy      isobel laughed   i don t think jewels would count for much in my ideas  of happiness       it is not so much the jewels  my dear  in themselves  but the envy they  would excite in every other woman       i don t think i can understand that feeling  mrs  doolan  i can  understand that there might be a satisfaction in being envied for being  the happiest woman  or the most tastefully dressed woman  or even the  prettiest woman  though that after all is a mere accident  but not for  having the greatest number of bright stones  however valuable  i don t  think the most lovely set of diamonds ever seen would give me as much  satisfaction as a few choice flowers       ah  but that is because you are quite young   mrs  doolan said   eve  was tempted by an apple  but eve had not lived long  you see  an apple  will tempt a child  and flowers a young girl  diamonds are the bait of a  woman       you would not care for diamonds yourself  mrs  doolan       i don t know  my dear  the experiment was never tried  bog oak and  irish diamonds have been more in my line  jim s pay has never run to  diamonds  worse luck  but he has promised me that if he ever gets a  chance of looting the palace of a native prince he will keep a special  lookout for them for me  so far he has never had the chance  when he was  an ensign there was some hard fighting with the sikhs  but nothing of  that sort fell to his share  i often tell him that he took me under  false pretenses altogether  i had visions of returning some day and  astonishing ballycrogin  as a sort of begum covered with diamonds  but  as far as i can see the children are the only jewels that i am likely to  take back       and very nice jewels too   isobel said heartily   they are dear little  things  mrs  doolan  and worth all the diamonds in the world  i hear   mrs  prothero  that your husband has a good chance of winning the race  for arabs  i intend to wager several pairs of gloves on his horse       yes  seila is very fast  she won last year  but nana sahib has had the  horse that won the cup at poona last year  and is considered one of the  fastest in india  brought across from bombay  our only hope is that he  will put a native up  and in that case we ought to have a fair chance   for the natives have no idea of riding a waiting race  but go off at  full speed  and take it all out of their horse before the end of the  race       well  we must hope he will  mrs  prothero  that seems  from what i  hear  the only chance there is of the regiment winning a prize  so all  our sympathies will be with you       hunter and his wife and their two girls are coming   the major said   the next morning  as he opened his letters      very well  uncle  then we will do as we arranged  the miss hunters  shall have my room  and i will take the little passage room       i am afraid it will put you out  isobel  but they have been here for  the last two years at the race times and i did not like not asking them  again       of course  uncle  it will make no difference to me  and i don t require  any very great space to apparel myself       we must have dinners for twelve at least  the day before the races  and  on the three days of the meeting      isobel looked alarmed   i hope you don t rely on me for the  arrangements  uncle  at each of the four dinners we have been to i have  done nothing but wonder how it was all done  and have been trembling  over the thought that it would be our turn presently  it seemed a  fearful responsibility  and four  one after the other  is an appalling  prospect       rumzan will see to it all  my dear  he has always managed very well  before  i will talk it over with him  besides  these will not be like  regular set dinner parties  at race meetings everyone keeps pretty  nearly open house  one does not ask any of the people at the station   they have all their own visitors  one trusts to chance to fill up the  table  and one never finds any difficulty about it  it is lucky i got up  a regular stock of china  and so on  in anticipation of your coming   of course  as a bachelor  i have not been a dinner giver  except on  occasions like this  when nobody expects anything like state  and things  are conducted to a certain extent in picnic fashion  i have paid off my  dinner obligations by having men to mess or the club  however  i will  consult rumzan  and we will have a regular parade of our materials   and you shall inspect our resources  if there is anything in the way  of flower vases or center dishes  or anything of that sort  you think  requisite  we must get them  jestonjee has got a good stock of all that  sort of thing  as to tablecloths and napkins and so on  i had a supply  with the china  so you will find that all right  of course you will get  plenty of flowers  they are the principal things  after all  towards  making the table look well  you have had no experience in arranging  them  i suppose       none at all  uncle  i never arranged a vase of flowers in my life       then i tell you what you had better do  isobel  you coax the doctor  into coming in and undertaking it  he is famous in that way  he always  has the decoration of the mess table on grand occasions  and when we  give a dance the flowers and decorations are left to him as a matter of  course       i will ask him  uncle  but he is the last man in the world i should  have thought of in connection with flowers and decorations       he is a many sided man  my dear  he paints excellently  and has  wonderful taste in the way of dress  i can assure you that no lady in  the regiment is quite satisfied with a new costume until it has received  the stamp of the doctor s approval  when we were stationed at delhi four  years ago there was a fancy ball  and people who were judges of that  sort of thing said that they had never seen so pretty a collection of  dresses  and i should think fully half of them were manufactured from  the doctor s sketches       i remember now   isobel laughed   that he was very sarcastic on board  ship as to the dresses of some of the people  but i thought it was only  his way of grumbling at things in general  though certainly i generally  agreed with him  he told me one day that my taste evidently inclined to  the dowdy  but you see i wore half mourning until i arrived out here      the doctor himself dropped in an hour later      i shall be glad  doctor  if you will dine with us as often as you can  during the four days of the races   major hannay said   of course  i  shall be doing the hospitable to people who come in from out stations   and as isobel won t know any of them  it will be a little trying to  her  acting for the first time in the capacity of hostess  as you know  everybody  you will be able to make things go  i have got hunter and his  wife and their two girls coming in to stay  i calculate the table will  hold fourteen comfortably enough  at any rate  come first night  even if  you can t come on the others       certainly i will  major  if you will let me bring bathurst in with me   he is going to stay with me for the races       by all means  doctor  i like what i have seen of him very much       yes  he has got a lot in him   the doctor said   only he is always head  over heels in work  he will make a big mark before he has done  he is  one of the few men out here who has thoroughly mastered the language  he  can talk to the natives like one of themselves  and understands them so  thoroughly that they are absolutely afraid to lie to him  which is the  highest compliment a native can pay to an indian official  it is very  seldom he comes in to this sort of thing  but i seized him the other  day and told him that i could see he would break down if he didn t give  himself a holiday  and i fairly worried him into saying he would come  over and stay for the races  i believe then he would not have come if i  had not written to him that all the native swells would be here  and  it would be an excellent opportunity for him to talk to them about  the establishment of a school for the daughters of the upper class of  natives  that is one of his fads at present       but it would be a good thing surely  doctor   isobel said      no doubt  my dear  no doubt  and so would scores of other things  if  you could but persuade the natives so  but this is really one of the  most impracticable schemes possible  simply because the whole of these  unfortunate children get betrothed when they are two or three years  old  and are married at twelve  even if all parties were agreed  the  husband s relations and the wife s relations and everyone else  what are  you going to teach a child worth knowing before she gets to the age of  twelve  just enough to make her discontented with her lot  once get the  natives to alter their customs and to marry their women at the age of  eighteen  and you may do something for them  but as long as they  stick to this idiotic custom of marrying them off when they are still  children  the case is hopeless       there is something i wanted to ask you  doctor   isobel said   you know  this is the first time i have had anything to do with entertaining  and  i know nothing about decorating a table  uncle says that you are a great  hand at the arrangement of flowers  would you mind seeing to it for me      the doctor nodded   with pleasure  miss hannay  it is a thing i enjoy   there is nothing more lamentable than to see the ignorant  and i may  almost say brutal  way in which people bunch flowers up into great  masses and call that decoration  they might just as well bunch up so  many masses of bright colored rags  the shape of the flower  its manner  of growth  and its individuality are altogether lost  and the sole  effect produced is that of a confused mass of color  i will undertake  that part of the business  and you had better leave the buying of the  flowers to me       certainly  doctor   the major said   i will give you carte blanche       well  i must see your dinner service  major  so that i may know about  its color  and what you have got to put the flowers into       i will have a regular parade tomorrow morning after breakfast  if it  would be convenient for you to look in then  and at the same time i will  get you to have a talk with rumzan and the cook  i am almost as new to  giving dinner parties as isobel is  when one has half a dozen men to  dine with one at the club  one gives the butler notice and chooses  the wine  and one knows that it will be all right  but it is a  very different thing when you have to go into the details yourself   ordinarily i leave it entirely to rumzan and the cook  and i am bound to  say they do very well  but this is a different matter       we will talk it over with them together  major  you can seem to consult  me  but it must come from you to them  or else you will be getting their  backs up  thank goodness  indian servants don t give themselves the airs  english ones do  but human nature is a good deal the same everywhere   and the first great rule  if you want any domestic arrangements to go  off well  is to keep the servants in good temper       we none of us like to be interfered with  doctor       a wise man is always ready to be taught   the doctor said  sententiously      well  there are exceptions  doctor  i remember  soon after i joined  a  man blew off two of his fingers  a young surgeon who was here wanted  to amputate the hand  he was just going to set about it when a staff  surgeon came in and said that it had better not be done  for that  natives could not stand amputations  the young surgeon was very much  annoyed  the staff surgeon went away next day  there was a good deal of  inflammation  and the young surgeon decided to amputate  the man never  rallied from the operation  and died next day       i said  major  that a wise man was always ready to listen to good  advice  i was not a wise man in those days  i was a pig headed young  fool  i thought i knew all about it  and i was quite right according  to my experience in london hospitals  in the case of an englishman  the  hand would have been amputated  and the man would have been all right  three weeks afterwards  but i knew nothing about these soft hearted  hindoos  and never dreamt that an operation which would be a trifle to  an englishman would be fatal to one of them  and that simply because   although they are plucky enough in some respects  they have no more  heart than a mouse when anything is the matter with them  yes  if it  hadn t been for the old colonel  who gave me a private hint to say  nothing about the affair  but merely to put down in my report   died  from the effect of a gunshot wound   i should have got into a deuce of a  scrape over that affair  as it was  it only cost me a hundred rupees  to satisfy the man s family and send them back to their native village   that was for years a standing joke against me  miss hannay  except your  uncle and the colonel  there is no one left in the regiment who was  there  but it was a sore subject for a long time  still  no doubt  it  was a useful lesson  and my rule has been ever since  never amputate  except as a forlorn hope  and even then don t amputate  for if you do  the relatives of the man  as far as his fourth cousins  will inevitably  regard you as his murderer  well  i must be off  i will look in tomorrow  morning  major  and make an inspection of your resources       i am glad to see the hunters are going to bring over their carriage    the major said  two days later  as he looked through a letter   i am  very glad of that  for i put it off till too late  i have been trying  everywhere for the last two days to hire one  but they are all engaged   and have been so for weeks  i hear  i was wondering what i should do   for my buggy will only hold two  i was thinking of asking mrs  doolan if  she could take one of the miss hunters  and should have tried to find a  place for the other  but this settles it all comfortably  they are going  to send on their own horses halfway the day before  and hire native  ponies for the first half  they have a good large family vehicle  i  hoped that they would bring it  but  of course  i could not trust to  it      the doctor presently dropped in with captain doolan  after chatting for  some time the former said   i have had the satisfaction this morning   miss hannay  of relieving mrs  cromarty s mind of a great burden       how was that  doctor       it was in relation to you  my dear       me  doctor  how could i have been a weight on mrs  cromarty s mind       she sent for me under the pretense of being feverish  said she had a  headache  and so on  her pulse was all right  and i told her at once i  did not think there was much the matter with her  but i recommended her  to keep out of the sun for two days  then she begun a chat about the  station  she knows that  somehow or other  i generally hear all that is  going on  i wondered what was coming  till she said casually   do you  know what arrangement major hannay has made as to his niece for the  races   i said  of course  that the hunters were coming over to stay   i could see at once that her spirit was instantly relieved of a heavy  burden  but she only said   of course  then  that settles the question   i had intended to send across to her this morning  to ask if she would  like a seat in my carriage  having no lady with her  she could not very  well have gone to the races alone  naturally  i should have been very  pleased to have had her with us  however  as mrs  hunter will be staying  at the major s  and will act as her chaperon  the matter is settled        well  i think it was very kind of her thinking of it   isobel said    and i don t think it is nice of you  doctor  to say that it was an  evident relief to her when she found i had someone else to take care of  me  why should it have been a relief       i have no doubt it has weighed on her mind for the last fortnight   the  doctor said   she must have seen that as you were freshly joined  and  the only unmarried girl in the regiment  except her own daughters  it  was only the proper thing she should offer you a seat in her carriage   no doubt she decided to put it off as late as possible  in hopes that  you might make some other arrangement  had you not done so  she might  have done the heroic thing and invited you  though i am by no means sure  of it  of course  now she will say the first time she meets you that she  was quite disappointed at having heard from me that mrs  hunter would  be with you  as she had hoped to have the pleasure of having you in her  carriage with her       but why shouldn t she like it   isobel said indignantly   surely i am  not as disagreeable as all that  come  doctor      captain doolan laughed  while the doctor said   it is just the contrary   my dear  i am quite sure that if you were in mrs  cromarty s place   and had two tall  washed out looking daughters  you would not feel the  slightest desire to place miss hannay in the same carriage with them       i call that very disagreeable of you  doctor   isobel said  flushing    and i shall not like you at all if you take such unkind and malicious  views of people  i don t suppose such an idea ever entered into mrs   cromarty s head  and even if it did  it makes it all the kinder that she  should think of offering me a seat  i do think most men seem to consider  that women think of nothing but looks  and that girls are always trying  to attract men  and mothers always thinking of getting their daughters  married  it is not at all nice  doctor  to have such ideas  and i shall  thank mrs  cromarty warmly  when i see her  for her kindness in thinking  about me      accordingly  that afternoon  when they met at the usual hour  when the  band was playing  isobel went up to the colonel s wife      i want to thank you  mrs  cromarty  dr  wade has told me that you had  intended to offer me a seat in your carriage to the races  it was very  kind and nice of you to think of me  and i am very much obliged to you   i should have enjoyed it very much if it hadn t been that mrs  hunter  is coming to stay with us  and  of course  i shall be under her wing   still  i am just as much obliged to you for having thought of it      mrs  cromarty was pleased with the girl s warmth and manner  and  afterwards mentioned to several of her friends that she thought that  miss hannay seemed a very nice young woman      i was not quite favorably impressed at first   she admitted   she has  the misfortune of being a little brusque in her manner  but  of course   her position is a difficult one  being alone out here  without any  lady with her  and no doubt she feels it so  she was quite touchingly  grateful  only because i offered her a seat in our carriage for the  races  though she was unable to accept it  as the major will have the  hunters staying with him          chapter vi       the clubhouse at cawnpore was crowded on the evening before the races   up to eleven o clock it had been comparatively deserted  for there was  scarcely a bungalow in the station at which dinner parties were not  going on  but  after eleven  the gentlemen for the most part adjourned  to the club for a smoke  a rubber  or a game of billiards  or to chat  over the racing events of the next day     loud greetings were exchanged as each fresh contingent arrived  for many  newcomers had come into the station only that afternoon  every table in  the whist room was occupied  black pool was being played in the billiard  room upstairs  where most of the younger men were gathered  while the  elders smoked and talked in the rooms below      what will you do  bathurst   the doctor asked his guest  after  the party from the major s had been chatting for some little time  downstairs   would you like to cut in at a rubber or take a ball at  pool       neither  doctor  they are both accomplishments beyond me  i have not  patience for whist  and i can t play billiards in the least  i have  tried over and over again  but i am too nervous  i fancy  i break down  over the easiest stroke  in fact  an easy stroke is harder for me than  a difficult one  i know i ought to make it  and just for that reason  i  suppose  i don t       you don t give one the idea of a nervous man  either  bathurst       well  i am  doctor  constitutionally  indeed terribly so       not in business matters  anyhow   the doctor said  with a smile   you  have the reputation of not minding in the slightest what responsibility  you take upon yourself  and of carrying out what you undertake in the  most resolute  i won t say high handed  manner       no  it doesn t come in there   bathurst laughed   morally i am not  nervous so far as i know  physically i am  i would give a great deal if  i could get over it  but  as i have said  it is constitutional       not on your father s side  bathurst  i knew him well  and he was a very  gallant officer       no  it was the other side   bathurst said   i will tell you about it  some day      at this moment another friend of bathurst s came up and entered into  conversation with him      well  i will go upstairs to the billiard room   the doctor said   and  you will find me there  bathurst  whenever you feel disposed to go      a pool had just finished when the doctor entered the billiard room      that is right  doctor  you are just in time   prothero said  as he  entered   sinclair has given up his cue  he is going to ride tomorrow   and is afraid of shaking his nerves  you must come and play for the  honor of the corps  i am being ruined altogether  and doolan has retired  discomfited       i have not touched a cue since i went away   the doctor said   but i  don t mind adding to the list of victims  who are the winners       messenger and jarvis have been carrying all before them  there is a  report they have just sent off two club waiters  with loads of rupees   to their quarters  scarsdale has been pretty well holding his own  but  the rest of us are nowhere      a year s want of practice  however  told  and the doctor was added to  the list of victims  he had no difficulty in getting someone else to  take his cue after playing for half an hour      it shows that practice is required for everything   he said   before  i went away i could have given each of those men a life  now they could  give me two  i must devote half an hour a day to it till i get it back  again       and you shall give me a lesson  doctor   captain doolan  who had also  retired  said      it would be time thrown away by both of us  doolan  you would never  make a pool player if you were to practice all your life  it is not the  eye that is wrong  but the temperament  you can make a very good shot  now and then  but you are too harum scarum and slap dash altogether   the art of playing pool is the art of placing yourself  while  when you  strike  you have not the faintest idea where your ball is going to   and you are just as likely to run in yourself as you are to pot your  adversary  i should abjure it if i were you  doolan  it is too expensive  a luxury for you to indulge in       you are right there  doctor  only what is a man to do when fellows say    we want you to make up a pool  doolan        i should say the reply would be quite simple  i should answer   i am  ready enough to play if any of you are ready to pay my losses and take  my winnings  i am tired of being as good as an annuity to you all    for that is what you have been for the last ten years  why  it would be  cheaper for you to send home to england for skittles  and get a ground  up here       but i don t play so very badly  doctor       if you play badly enough always to lose  it doesn t matter as to the  precise degree of badness   the doctor retorted   it is not surprising   when you came out here  fourteen or fifteen years ago  boys did not  take to playing billiards  but they do now  look at that little villain   richards  he has just cleared the table  and done it with all the  coolness of a professional marker  the young scoundrel ought to have  been in bed two hours ago  for i hear that tat of his is really a good  one  not that it will make any difference to him  that sort of boy would  play billiards till the first bugle sounds in the morning  and have a  wash and turn out as fresh as paint  but it won t last  doolan  not in  this climate  his cheeks will have fallen in and he will have crow s  feet at the corners of his eyes before another year has gone over  i  like that other boy  wilson  better  of course he is a cub as yet  but  i should say there is good in him  just at present i can see he is  beginning to fancy himself in love with miss hannay  that will do him  good  it is always an advantage to a lad like that to have a good honest  liking for a nice girl  of course it comes to nothing  and for a time he  imagines himself the most unhappy of mortals  but it does him good for  all that  fellows are far less likely to get into mischief and go to the  bad after an affair of that sort  it gives him a high ideal  and if he  is worth anything he will try to make himself worthy of her  and the  good it does him will continue even after the charm is broken       what a fellow you are  doctor   captain doolan said  looking down upon  his companion   talking away like that in the middle of this racket   which would be enough to bother saint patrick himself       well  come along downstairs  doolan  we will have a final peg and then  be off  i expect bathurst is beginning to fidget before now       it will do him good   captain doolan said disdainfully   i have no  patience with a man who is forever working himself to death  riding  about the country as if old nick were behind him  and never giving  himself a minute for diversion of any kind  faith  i would rather throw  myself down a well and have done with it  than work ten times as hard as  a black nigger       well  i don t think  doolan   the doctor said dryly   you are ever  likely to be driven to suicide by any such cause       you are right there  doctor   the other said contentedly   no man can  throw it in my teeth that i ever worked when i had no occasion to work   if there were a campaign  i expect i could do my share with the best of  them  but in quiet times i just do what i have to do  and if anyone has  an anxiety to take my place in the rota for duty  he is as welcome to  it as the flowers of may  i had my share of it when i was a subaltern   there is no better fellow living than the major  but when he was captain  of my company he used to keep me on the run by the hour together  till i  wished myself back in connaught  and anyone who liked it might have had  the whole of india for anything i cared  he was one of the most uneasy  creatures i ever came across       the major is a good officer  doolan  and you were as lazy a youngster   and as hard a bargain  as the company ever got  you ought to thank  your stars that you had the good luck in having a captain who knew  his business  and made you learn yours  why  if you had had a man like  rintoul as your captain  you would never have been worth your salt       you are not complimentary  doctor  but then nobody looks for  compliments from you       i can pay compliments if i have a chance   the doctor retorted   but  it is very seldom i get one of doing so  at least  without lying  well   bathurst  are you ready to turn in       quite ready  doctor  that is one of the advantages of not caring for  races  the merits and demerits of the horses that run tomorrow do not in  the slightest degree affect me  and even the news that all the favorites  had gone wrong would not deprive me of an hour s sleep       i think it a good thing to take an interest in racing  bathurst  take  men as a whole  out here they work hard  some of them work tremendously  hard  and unless they get some change to their thoughts  some sort of  recreation  nineteen out of twenty will break down sooner or later  if  they don t they become mere machines  every man ought to have some sort  of hobby  he need not ride it to death  but he wants to take some sort  of interest in it  i don t care whether he takes to pig sticking  or  racing  or shooting  or whether he goes in for what i may call the  milder kinds of relaxation  such as dining out  billiards  whist  or  even general philandering  anything is better than nothing  anything  that will take his mind off his work  as far as i can see  you don t do  anything       therefore i shall either break down or become a machine  doctor       one or the other certainly  bathurst  you may smile  but i mean what i  say  i have seen other young fellows just as full of work and enthusiasm  as you are  but i have never seen an exception to the rule  unless  of  course  they took up something so as to give their minds a rest       the doctor has just been scolding me because i am not fond enough of  work   captain doolan laughed      you are differently placed  doolan   the doctor said   you have got  plenty of enthusiasm in your nature  most irishmen have  but you have  had nothing to stir it  life in a native regiment in india is an easy  one  your duties are over in two or three hours out of the twenty four   whereas the work of a civilian in a large district literally never  ends  unless he puts a resolute stop to it  what with seeing people from  morning until night  and riding about and listening to complaints  every  hour of the day is occupied  and then at night there are reports to  write and documents of all sorts to go through  it is a great pity that  there cannot be a better division of work  though i own i don t see how  it is to be managed      by this time they were walking towards the lines      i should not mind taking a share of the civil work at the station    captain doolan said   if they would make our pay a little more like that  of the civilians       there is something in that  doolan   the doctor agreed   it is just  as hard work having nothing to do as it is having too much  and i have  always been of opinion that the tremendous disproportion between the pay  of a military man and of a civilian of the same age is simply monstrous   well  goodnight  doolan  i hope you will tell mrs  doolan that the  credit is entirely due to me that you are home at the reasonable hour of  one o clock  instead of dropping in just in time to change for parade       a good fellow   the doctor said  as he walked on with bathurst   he  would never set the thames on fire  but he is an honest  kindly fellow   he would make a capital officer if he were on service  his marriage has  been an excellent thing for him  he had nothing to do before but to pass  away his time in the club or mess house  and drink more than was good  for him  but he has pulled himself round altogether since he married   his wife is a bright  clever little woman  and knows how to make the  house happy for him  if he had married a lackadaisical sort of a woman   the betting is he would have gone to the bad altogether       i only met him once or twice before   bathurst said   you see i am not  here very often  and when i am it is only on business  so i know a very  few people here except those i have to deal with  and by the time i have  got through my business i am generally so thoroughly out of temper with  the pig headed stupidity and obstinacy of people in general  that i get  into my buggy and drive straight away       i fancy you irritate them as much as they irritate you  bathurst  well   here we are  now we will have a quiet cheroot and a peg  to quiet our  nerves after all that din  before we turn in  let us get off our coats  and collars  and make ourselves comfortable  it is a proof of the  bestial stupidity of mankind that they should wear such abominations as  dress clothes in a climate like this  here  boy  light the candles and  bring two sodas and brandies       well  bathurst   he went on  when they had made themselves comfortable  in two lounging chairs   what do you thing of miss hannay       i was prepared to admire her  doctor  from what you said  it is not  very often that you overpraise things  but she is a charming girl  very  pretty and bright  frank and natural       she is all that   the doctor said   we were four months on the  voyage out  and i saw enough of her in that time to know her pretty  thoroughly       what puzzles me about her   bathurst said   is that i seemed to know  her face  where i saw her  and under what circumstances  i have been  puzzling myself half the evening to recall  but i have the strongest  conviction that i have met her       you are dreaming  man  you have been out here eight years  she was a  child of ten when you left england  you certainly have not seen her  and  as i know pretty well every woman who has been in this station for  the last five or six years  i can answer for it that you have not seen  anyone in the slightest degree resembling her       that is what i have been saying to myself  doctor  but that does not in  the slightest degree shake my conviction about it       then you must have dreamt it   the doctor said decidedly   some fool  of a poet has said   visions of love cast their shadows before   or  something of that sort  which of course is a lie  still  that is the  only way that i can account for it      bathurst smiled faintly   i don t think the quotation is quite right   doctor  anyhow  i am convinced that the impression is far too vivid to  have been the result of a dream       by the way  bathurst   the doctor said  suddenly changing his  conversation   what do you think of this talk we hear about chupaties  being sent round among the native troops  and the talk about greased  cartridges  you see more of the natives than anyone i know  do you think  there is anything brewing in the air       if there is  doctor  i am certain it is not known to the natives in  general  i see no change whatever in their manner  and i am sure i know  them well enough to notice any change if it existed  i know nothing  about the sepoys  but garnet tells me that the company at deennugghur  give him nothing to complain of  though they don t obey orders as  smartly as usual  and they have a  sullen air as they go about their  work       i don t like it  bathurst  i do not understand what the chupaties mean   but i know that there is a sort of tradition that the sending of  them round has always preceded trouble  the sepoys have no reason for  discontent  but there has been no active service lately  and idleness  is always bad for men  i can t believe there is any widespread  dissatisfaction among them  but there is no doubt whatever that if there  is  and it breaks out  the position will be a very serious one  there  are not half enough white troops in india  and the sepoys may well think  that they are masters of the situation  it would be a terrible time for  everyone in india if they did take it into their heads to rise       i can t believe they would be mad enough to do that  doctor  they have  everything to lose by it  and nothing to gain  that is  individually   and we should be sure to win in the long run  even if we had to conquer  back india foot by foot       that is all very well  bathurst  we may know that we could do it  but  they don t know it  they are ignorant altogether of the forces we could  put into the field were there a necessity to make the effort  they  naturally suppose that we can have but a few soldiers  for in all  the battles we have fought there have always been two or three sepoy  regiments to one english  besides  they consider themselves fully a  match for us  they have fought by us side by side in every battlefield  in india  and have done as well as we have  i don t see what they should  rise for  i don t even see whose interest it is to bring a rising about   but i do know that if they rise we shall have a terrible time of it   now i think we may as well turn in  you won t take another peg  well   i shall see you in the morning  i shall be at the hospital by half past  six  and shall be in at half past eight to breakfast  you have only got  to shout for my man  and tell him whether you will have tea  coffee  or  chocolate  any time you wake       i shall be about by six  doctor  five is my general hour  but as it is  past one now i dare say i shall be able to sleep on for an hour later   especially as there is nothing to do       you can go round the hospital with me  if you like   the doctor said    if you will promise not to make a dozen suggestions for the improvement  of things in general      isobel hannay came down to breakfast in high spirits upon the morning of  the races  the dinner had gone off excellently  the dinner table  with  its softly shaded lamps  and the doctor s arrangements of the flowers   had been  she thought  perfection  and everything had passed off without  a hitch  her duties as a hostess had been much lighter than she had  anticipated  mrs  hunter was a very pleasant  motherly woman  and the  girls  who had only come out from england four months before  were fresh  and unaffected  and the other people had all been pleasant and chatty     altogether  she felt that her first dinner party had been a great  success     she was looking forward now with pleasant anticipation to the day  she  had seen but little of the natives so far  and she was now to see them  at their best  then she had never been present at a race  and everything  would be new and exciting      well  uncle  what time did you get in   she asked  as she stepped out  into the veranda to meet him on his return from early parade   it was  too bad of you and mr  hunter running off instead of waiting to chat  things over       i have no doubt you ladies did plenty of that  my dear       indeed  we didn t  uncle  you see they had had a very long drive  and  mrs  hunter insisted on the girls going to bed directly you all went  out  and as i could not sit up by myself  i had to go too       we were in at half past twelve   the major said   i can stand a good  deal of smoke  but the club atmosphere was too thick for me       everything went off very well yesterday  didn t it   she asked      very well  i thought  my dear  thanks to you and the doctor and  rumzan       i had very little to do with it   she laughed      well  i don t think you had much to do with the absolute arrangements   isobel  but i thought you did very well as hostess  it seemed to me that  there was a good deal of laughing and fun at your end of the table       yes  you see we had the two miss hunters and the doctor there  and mr   gregson  who took me in  turned out a very merry old gentleman       he would not be pleased if he heard you call him old  isobel       well  of course he is not absolutely old  but being a commissioner  and  all that sort of thing  gives one the idea of being old  but there are  the others      and they went into the breakfast room     the first race was set for two o clock  and at half past one mrs   hunter s carriage  with the four ladies  arrived at the inclosure  the  horses were taken out  and the carriage wheeled into its place  and then  isobel and the two miss hunters prepared to enjoy the scene     it was a very gay one  the course was at present covered with a throng  of natives in their bright colored garments  and mixed with them were  the scarlet uniforms of the sepoys of the    d and other regiments   on the opposite side were a number of native vehicles of various  descriptions  and some elephants with painted faces and gorgeous  trappings  and with howdahs shaded by pavilions glittering with gilt and  silver     on either side of their vehicle a long line of carriages was soon formed  up  and among these were several occupied by gayly dressed natives   whose rank gave them an entrance to the privileged inclosure  the  carriages were placed three or four yards back from the rail  and the  intervening space was filled with civilian and military officers  in  white or light attire  and with pith helmet or puggaree  many others  were on horseback behind the carriages      it is a bright scene  miss hannay   the doctor said  coming up to the  carriage      wonderfully pretty  doctor       an english race course doesn t do after this  i can tell you  i went  down to the derby when i was at home  and such an assembly of riff raff  i never saw before and never wish to see again       these people are more picturesque  dr  wade   mrs  hunter said   but  that is merely a question of garment  these people perhaps are no more  trustworthy than those you met on the racecourse at home       i was speaking of them purely as a spectacle  individually i have no  doubt one would be safer among the english roughs and betting men than  among these placid looking natives  the one would pick your pockets of  every penny you have got if they had the chance  the other would cut  your throat with just as little compunction       you don t really mean that  dr  wade   isobel said      i do indeed  miss hannay  the oude men are notorious brawlers and  fighters  and i should say that the roughs of cawnpore and lucknow could  give long odds to those of any european city  and three out of four of  those men you see walking about there would not only cut the throat of a  european to obtain what money he had about him  but would do so without  that incentive  upon the simple ground that he hated us       but why should he hate us  doctor  he is none the worse off now than he  was before we annexed the country       well  yes  that class of man is worse off  in the old days every noble  and zemindar kept up a little army for the purpose of fighting his  neighbors  just as our barons used to do in the happy olden times people  talk of  we have put down private fighting  and the consequence is these  men s occupations are gone  and they flock to great towns and there live  as best they can  ready to commit any crime whatever for the sum of a  few rupees      there is nana sahib      isobel looked round and saw a carriage with a magnificent pair of  horses  in harness almost covered with silver ornaments  drive up to a  place that had been kept vacant for it  four natives were sitting in it      that is the rajah   the doctor said   the farther man  with that  aigrette of diamonds in his turban  he is oriental today  but sometimes  he affects english fashions  he is a very cheery fellow  he keeps pretty  well open house at bithoor  has a billiard table  and a first rate  cellar of wine  carriages for the use of guests  in fact  he does the  thing really handsomely       here is my opera glass   mrs  hunter said  isobel looked long and  fixedly at the rajah      well  what do you think of him   the doctor asked as she lowered it      i do not know what to think of him   she said   his face does not  tell me anything  it is like looking at a mask  but you see i am not  accustomed to read brown men s characters  they are so different from  europeans  their faces all seem so impassive  i suppose it is the way in  which they are brought up and trained       ages of tyranny have made them supple and deceitful   the doctor  said   but of course less so here than among the bengallies  who  being  naturally unwarlike and cowardly  have always been the slaves of some  master or other      you evidently don t like the nana  miss hannay  i am rather glad you  don t  for he is no great favorite of mine  though he is so generally  popular in the station here  i don t like him because it is not natural  that he should be so friendly with us  we undoubtedly  according to  native notions  robbed him of one of the finest positions in india  by refusing to acknowledge his adoption  we have given him a princely  revenue  but that  after all  is a mere trifle to what he would have had  as peishwa  whatever virtues the natives of this country possess  the  forgiving of injuries is not among them  and therefore i consider it  to be altogether unnatural that he  having been  as he at any rate and  everyone round him must consider  foully wronged  should go out of his  way to affect our society and declare the warmest friendship for us      the rajah was laughing and talking with general wheeler and the group of  officers round his carriage     again isobel raised the glasses   you are right  doctor   she said   i  don t like him       well  there is one comfort  it doesn t matter whether he is sincere  or not  he is powerless to hurt us  i don t see any motive for his  pretending to be friendly if he is not  but i own that i should like him  better if he sulked and would have nothing to say to us  as would be the  natural course      the bell now began to ring  and the native police cleared the course   major hannay and mr  hunter  who had driven over in the buggy  came up  and took their places on the box of the carriage      here are cards of the races   he said   now is the time  young ladies   to make your bets       i don t know even the name of anyone in this first race   isobel said   looking at the card      that doesn t matter in the least  miss hannay   wilson  who had just  come up to the side of the carriage  said   there are six horses in  you  pick out any one you like  and i will lay you five pairs of gloves to  one against him       but how am i to pick out when i don t know anything about them  mr   wilson  i might pick out one that had no chance at all       yes  but you might pick out the favorite  miss hannay  so that it is  quite fair       don t you bet  isobel   her uncle said   let us have a sweepstake  instead       what is a sweepstake  uncle      there was a general laugh      well  my dear  we each put in a rupee  there are six of us  and there  are wilson and the doctor  you will go in  doctor  won t you       yes  i don t mind throwing away a rupee  major       very well  that makes eight  we put eight pieces of paper in the hat   six of them have got the names of the horses on  the other two are  blank  then we each pull out one  whoever draws the name of the horse  that wins takes five rupees  the holder of the second two  and the third  saves his stake  you shall hold the stakes  mrs  hunter  we have all  confidence in you      the slips were drawn      my horse is bruce   isobel said      there he is  miss hannay   wilson  who had drawn a blank  said  as  a horse whose rider had a straw colored jacket and cap came cantering  along the course   this is a race for country horses  owners up   that means ridden by their owners  that is pearson of the   th native  cavalry  he brought the horse over from lucknow       what chance has he       i have not the least idea  miss hannay  i did not hear any betting on  this race at all       that is a nice horse  uncle   isobel said  as one with a rider in black  jacket  with red cap  came past      that is delhi  yes  it has good action       that is mine   the eldest miss hunter said      the rider is a good looking young fellow   the doctor said   and is  perfectly conscious of it himself  who is he  wilson  i don t know him       he is a civilian  belongs to the public works  i think      the other horses now came along  and after short preliminary canters the  start was made  to isobel s disappointment her horse was never in the  race  which delhi looked like winning until near the post  when a rather  common looking horse  which had been lying a short distance behind him   came up with a rush and won by a length      i don t call that fair   miss hunter said   when the other was first  all along  i call that a mean way of winning  don t you  father       well  no  my dear  it was easy to see for the last quarter of a mile  that the other was making what is called  a waiting race  of it  and  was only biding his time  there is nothing unfair in that  i fancy delhi  might have won if he had had a better jockey  his rider never really  called upon him till it was too late  he was so thoroughly satisfied  with himself and his position in the race that he was taken completely  by surprise when moonshee came suddenly up to him       well  i think it is very hard upon delhi  father  after keeping ahead  all the way and going so nicely  i think everyone ought to do their best  from the first       i fancy you are thinking  miss hunter   the doctor said   quite as much  that it is hard on you being beaten after your hopes had been raised  as  it is upon the horse       perhaps i am  doctor   she admitted      i think it is much harder on me   isobel said   you have had the  satisfaction of thinking all along that your horse was going to win   while mine never gave me the least bit of hope       the proper expression  miss hannay  is  your horse never flattered  you       then i think it is a very silly expression  mr  wilson  because i don t  see that flattery has anything to do with it       ah  here is bathurst   the doctor said   where have you been  bathurst   you slipped away from me just now       i ve just been talking to the commissioner  doctor  i have been trying  to get him to see        why  you don t mean to say   the doctor broke in   that you have been  trying to cram your theories down his throat on a racecourse         it was before the race began   bathurst said   and i don t think the  commissioner has any more interest in racing than i have       not in racing   the doctor agreed   but i expect he has an interest in  enjoying himself generally  which is a thing you don t seem to have the  most remote idea of  here we are just getting up a sweepstake for the  next race  hand over a rupee and try to get up an interest in it  do try  and forget your work till the race is over  i have brought you here  to do you good  i regard you as my patient  and i give you my medical  orders that you are to enjoy yourself      bathurst laughed      i am enjoying myself in my way  doctor       who is that very pretty woman standing up in the next carriage but  one   isobel asked      she comes from an out station   the doctor repeated   she is the wife  of the collector there  but i think she likes cawnpore better than  boorgum  her name is rose       is that her husband talking to her       no  that is a man in the artillery here  i think       yes   the major said   that is harrowby  a good looking fellow  and  quite a ladies  man       do you mean a man ladies like  uncle  or who likes the society of  ladies       both in his case  i should fancy   the major said   i believe he is  considered one of the best looking men in the service       i don t see why he should be liked for that   isobel said   as far as i  have seen  good looking men are not so pleasant as others  i suppose it  is because they are conscious of their own good looks  and therefore do  not take the trouble of being amusing  we had one very good looking  man on board ship  and he was the dullest man to talk to on board  no   doctor  i won t have any names mentioned  but i am right  am i not       he was a dull specimen  certainly   the doctor said   but i think you  are a little too sweeping       i don t mean all good looking men  of course  but men who what i call  go in for being good looking  i don t know whether you know what i mean   what are you smiling at  mr  wilson       i was thinking of two or three men i know to whom your description  applies  miss hannay  but i must be going  they are just going to start  the next race  and mine is the one after  so i must go and get ready   you wish me success  don t you       i wish you all the success you deserve  i can t say more than that  can  i       i am afraid that is saying very little   he laughed   i don t expect to  win  but i do hope i shall beat richards  because he is so cock sure he  will beat me      this wish was not gratified  the first and second horses made a close  race of it  behind them by ten or twelve lengths came the other horses  in a clump  wilson and richards singling themselves out in the last  hundred yards and making a desperate race for the third place  for which  they made a dead heat  amid great laughter from their comrades      that is excellent   major hannay said   you won t see anything more  amusing than that today  girls  the third horse simply saved his stake   so that as they will of course divide  they will have paid twenty five  rupees each for the pleasure of riding  and the point which of their  tats is the fastest remains unsettled       well  they beat a good many of them  major hannay   miss hunter said    so they did not do so badly after all       oh  no  they did not do so badly  but it will be a long time before  they get over the chaff about their desperate struggle for the third  place      the next two races attracted but slight attention from the occupants  of the carriage  most of their acquaintances in the station came up one  after the other for a chat  there were many fresh introductions  and  there was so much conversation and laughter that the girls had little  time to attend to what was going on around them  wilson and richards  both sauntered up after changing  and were the subject of much chaff as  to their brilliant riding at the finish  both were firm in the belief  that the judge s finding was wrong  and each maintained stoutly he had  beaten the other by a good head     the race for arabs turned out a very exciting one  the rajah of  bithoor s horse was the favorite  on the strength of its performances  elsewhere  but prothero s horse was also well supported  especially in  the regiment  for the adjutant was a first class rider  and was in  great request at all the principal meetings in oude and the northwest  provinces  while it was known that the rajah s horse would be ridden by  a native  the latter was dressed in strict racing costume  and had at  the last races at cawnpore won two or three cups for the rajah     but the general opinion among the officers of the station was that  prothero s coolness and nerve would tell  his arab was certainly a fast  one  and had won the previous year  both at cawnpore and lucknow  but  the rajah s new purchase had gained so high a reputation in the western  presidency as fully to justify the odds of two to one laid on it  while  four to one were offered against prothero  and from eight to twenty to  one against any other competitor     prothero had stopped to have a chat at the hunters  carriage as he  walked towards the dressing tent      our hopes are all centered in you  mr  prothero   mr  hunter said    miss hannay has been wagering gloves in a frightfully reckless way       i should advise you to hedge if you can  miss hannay   he said   i  think there is no doubt that mameluke is a good deal faster than seila   i fancy he is pounds better  i only beat vincent s horse by a head last  year  and mameluke gave him seven pounds  and beat him by three lengths  at poona  so i should strongly advise you to hedge your bets if you  can       what does he mean by hedge  uncle       to hedge is to bet the other way  so that one bet cancels the other       oh  i shan t do that   she said   i have enough money to pay my bets if  i lose       do you mean to say you mean to pay your bets if you lose  miss hannay    the doctor asked incredulously      of course i do   she said indignantly   you don t suppose i intend to  take the gloves if i win  and not to pay if i lose       it is not altogether an uncommon practice among ladies   the doctor  said   when they bet against gentlemen  i believe that when they wager  against each other  which they do not often do  they are strictly  honest  but that otherwise their memories are apt to fail them  altogether       that is a libel  mrs  hunter  is it not       not altogether  i think  of course many ladies do pay their bets when  they lose  but others certainly do not       then i call it very mean   isobel said earnestly   why  it is as bad as  asking anyone to make you a present of so many pairs of gloves in case a  certain horse wins       it comes a good deal to the same thing   mrs  hunter admitted   but to  a certain extent it is a recognized custom  it is a sort of tribute that  is exacted at race time  just as in france every lady expects a present  from every gentleman of her acquaintance on new year s day       i wouldn t bet if i didn t mean to pay honestly   isobel said   and if  mr  prothero doesn t win  my debts will all be honorably discharged      there was a hush of expectation in the crowd when the ten horses whose  numbers were up went down to the starting point  a quarter of a mile  from the stand  they were to pass it  make the circuit  and finish  there  the race being two miles  the interest of the natives was  enlisted by the fact that nana sahib was running a horse  while the  hopes of the occupants of the inclosure rested principally on seila     the flag fell to a good start  but when the horses came along isobel saw  with surprise that the dark blue of the rajah and the adjutant s scarlet  and white were both in the rear of the group  soon afterwards the  scarlet seemed to be making its way through the horses  and was speedily  leading them      prothero is making the running with a vengeance   the major said   that  is not like his usual tactics  doctor       i fancy he knows what he is doing   the doctor replied   he saw that  mameluke s rider was going to make a waiting race of it  and as the  horse has certainly the turn of speed on him  he is trying other  tactics  they are passing the mile post now  and prothero is twelve or  fourteen lengths ahead  there  mameluke is going through his horses  his  rider is beginning to get nervous at the lead prothero has got  and  he can t stand it any longer  he ought to have waited for another half  mile  you will see  prothero will win after all  seila can stay  there  is no doubt about that      a roar of satisfaction rose from the mass of natives on the other side  of the inclosure as mameluke was seen to leave the group of horses and  gradually to gain upon seila      oh  he will catch him  uncle   isobel said  tearing her handkerchief in  her excitement     the major was watching the horses through his field glass      never mind his catching him   he said   prothero is riding quietly and  steadily  seila is doing nearly her best  but he is not hurrying her   while the fool on mameluke is bustling the horse as if he had only a  hundred yards further to go      the horses were nearing the point at which they had started  when a  shout from the crowd proclaimed that the blue jacket had come up to and  passed the scarlet  slowly it forged ahead until it was two lengths in  advance  for a few strides their relative positions remained unaltered   then there was a shout from the carriages  scarlet was coming up again   mameluke s rider glanced over his shoulder  and began to use the whip   for a few strides the horse widened the gap again  but prothero still  sat quiet and unmoved  just as they reached the end of the line of  carriages  seila again began to close up      seila wins  seila wins   the officers shouted     but it seemed to isobel that this was well nigh impossible  but foot by  foot the mare came up  and as they passed the hunters  carriage her head  was in advance     in spite of the desperate efforts of the rider of mameluke  another  hundred yards and they passed the winning post  seila a length ahead         chapter vii       the exultation of the officers of the    d over seila s victory was  great  they had all backed her  relying upon prothero s riding  but  although his success was generally popular among the europeans at  the station  many had lost considerable sums by their confidence in  mameluke s speed     isobel sat down feeling quite faint from the excitement      i did not think i could have been so excited over a race between two  horses   she said to mrs  hunter   it was not the bets  i never even  thought about them  it was just because i wanted to see mr  prothero s  horse win  i never understood before why people should take such an  interest in horse racing  but i quite understand now       what is your size  miss hannay   wilson asked      oh  i don t care anything about the gloves  mr  wilson  i am sorry i  bet now       you needn t feel any compunction in taking them from me or from any of  us  miss hannay  we have all won over seila  the regiment will have to  give a ball on the strength of it  i only put on a hundred rupees  and  so have won four hundred  but most of them have won ever so much more  than that  and all i have lost is four pair of gloves to you  and four  to mrs  doolan  and four to mrs  prothero  a dozen in all  which do you  take  white or cream  and what is your size       six and a half  cream       all right  miss hannay  the nana must have lost a good lot of money   he has been backing his horse with everyone who would lay against  it  however  it won t make any difference to him  and it is always a  satisfaction when the loss comes on someone to whom it doesn t matter a  bit  i think the regiment ought to give a dinner to prothero  major  it  was entirely his riding that did it  he hustled that nigger on mameluke  splendidly  if the fellow had waited till within half a mile of home he  would have won to a certainty  i never saw anything better       well  miss hannay  what do you think of a horse race   bathurst  who  had only remained a few minutes at the carriage  asked  as he strolled  up again   you said yesterday that you had never seen one       i am a little ashamed to say i was very much excited over it  mr   bathurst  you have not lost  i hope  you are looking  and she stopped      shaky   he said   yes  i feel shaky  i had not a penny on the race   for though the doctor made me put into a sweep last night at the club   i drew a blank  but the shouting and excitement at the finish seemed to  take my breath away  and i felt quite faint       that is just how i felt  i did not know men felt like that  they don t  generally seem to know what nerves are       i wish i didn t  it is a great nuisance  the doctor tries to persuade  me that it is the effect of overwork  but i have always been so from a  child  and i can t get over it       you don t look nervous  mr  bathurst       no  when a man is a fair size  and looks bronzed and healthy  no one  will give him credit for being nervous  i would give a very great deal  if i could get over it       i don t see that it matters much one way or the other  mr  bathurst       i can assure you that it does  i regard it as being a most serious  misfortune      isobel was a little surprised at the earnestness with which he spoke      i should not have thought that   she said quietly   but i can  understand that it is disagreeable for a man to feel nervous  simply   i suppose  because it is regarded as a feminine quality  but i think a  good many men are nervous  we had several entertainments on board the  ship coming out  and it was funny to see how many great strong men broke  down  especially those who had to make speeches       i am not nervous in that way   bathurst said  with a laugh   my pet  horror is noise  thunder prostrates me completely  and in fact all  noises  especially any sharp  sudden sound  affect me  i really find  it a great nuisance  i fancy a woman with nerves considers herself as  a martyr  and deserving of all pity and sympathy  it is almost a  fashionable complaint  and she is a little proud of it  but a man ought  to have his nerves in good order  and as much as that is expected of him  unless he is a feeble little body  there is the bell for the next race       are you going to bet on this race again  miss hannay   wilson said   coming up      no  mr  wilson  i have done my first and last bit of gambling  i  don t think it is nice  ladies betting  after all  and if there were a  hospital here i should order you to send the money the gloves will cost  you to it as conscience money  and then perhaps you might follow my  example with your winnings       my conscience is not moved in any way   he laughed   when it is i will  look out for a deserving charity  well  if you won t bet i must see if i  can make a small investment somewhere else       i shall see you at the ball  of course   isobel said  turning to mr   bathurst  as wilson left the carriage      no  i think not  balls are altogether out of my line  and as there is  always a superabundance of men at such affairs here  there is no sense  of duty about it       what is your line  mr  bathurst       i am afraid i have none  miss hannay  the fact is  there is really  more work to be done than one can get through  when you get to know the  natives well you cannot help liking them and longing to do them some  good if they would but let you  but it is so difficult to get them to  take up new ideas  their religion  with all its customs and ceremonies   seems designed expressly to bar out all improvements  except in the case  of abolishing suttee  we have scarcely weaned them from one of their  observances  and even now  in spite of our efforts  widows occasionally  immolate themselves  and that with the general approval      i wish i had an army of ten thousand english ladies all speaking the  language well to go about among the women and make friends with them   there would be more good done in that way than by all the officials in  india  they might not be able to emancipate themselves from all their  restrictions  but they might influence their children  and in time pave  the way for a moral revolution  but it is ridiculous   he said  breaking  off suddenly   my talking like this here  but you see it is what  you call my line  my hobby  if you like  but when one sees this hard  working  patient  gentle people making their lot so much harder than it  need be by their customs and observances one longs to force them even  against their own will to burst their bonds      dr  wade came up at this moment and caught the last word or two      you are incorrigible  bathurst  miss hannay  i warn you that this  man is a monomaniac  i drag him away from his work  and here he is  discoursing with you on reform just as a race is going to start  you  may imagine  my dear  what a thorn he is in the side of the bigwigs   you have heard of talleyrand s advice to a young official   above all  things  no zeal   go away  bathurst  miss hannay wants to see the race   and even if she doesn t she is powerless to assist you in your crusade      bathurst laughed and drew off      that is too bad  doctor  i was very interested  i like to talk to  people who can think of something besides races and balls and the gossip  of the station       yes  in reason  in reason  my dear  but there is a medium in all  things  i have no doubt bathurst will be quite happy some time or other  to give you his full views on child marriages  and the remarriages of  widows  and female education  and the land settlement  and a score of  other questions  but for this a few weeks of perfect leisure will be  required  seriously  you know that i think bathurst one of the finest  young fellows in the service  but his very earnestness injures both his  prospects and his utility  the officials have a horror of  enthusiasm  they like the cut and dried subordinate who does his duty  conscientiously  and does not trouble his head about anything but  carrying out the regulations laid down for him      theoretically i agree with most of bathurst s views  practically i see  that a score of officials like him would excite a revolution throughout  a whole province  in india  of all places in the world  the maxim  festina lente  go slow  is applicable  you have the prejudices of a  couple of thousand years against change  the people of all things are  jealous of the slightest appearance of interference with their customs   the change will no doubt come in time  but it must come gradually  and  must be the work of the natives themselves and not of us  to try to  hasten that time would be but to defer it  now  child  there is the  bell  now just attend to the business in hand       very well  doctor  i will obey your orders  but it is only fair to say  that mr  bathurst s remarks are only in answer to something i said   and  isobel turned to watch the race  but with an interest less ardent than  she had before felt     isobel s character was an essentially earnest one  and her life up to  the day of her departure to india had been one of few pleasures  she had  enjoyed the change and had entered heartily into it  and she was as yet  by no means tired of it  but she had upon her arrival at cawnpore been a  little disappointed that there was no definite work for her to perform   and had already begun to feel that a time would come when she would  want something more than gossip and amusements and the light talk of the  officers of her acquaintance to fill her life     she had as yet no distinct interest of her own  and bathurst s  earnestness had struck a cord in her own nature and seemed to open a  wide area for thought  she put it aside now and chatted gayly with the  hunters and those who came up to the carriage  but it came back to her  as she sat in her room before going to bed     up till now she had not heard a remark since she had been in cawnpore  that might not have been spoken had the cantonments there been the whole  of india  except that persons at other stations were mentioned  the  vast  seething native population were no more alluded to than if they  were a world apart  bathurst s words had for the first time brought home  to her the reality of their existence  and that around this little group  of english men and women lay a vast population  with their joys and  sorrows and sufferings     at breakfast she surprised mrs  hunter by asking a variety of questions  as to native customs   i suppose you have often been in the zenanas   mrs  hunter       not often  my dear  i have been in some of them  and very depressing it  is to see how childish and ignorant the women are       can nothing be done for them  mrs  hunter       very little  in time i suppose there will be schools for girls  but you  see they marry so young that it is difficult to get at them       how young do they marry       they are betrothed  although it has all the force of a marriage  as  infants  and a girl can be a widow at two or three years old  and so   poor little thing  she remains to the end of her life in a position  little better than that of a servant in her husband s family  really  they are married at ten or eleven      isobel looked amazed at this her first insight into native life  mrs   hunter smiled      i heard mr  bathurst saying something to you about it yesterday  miss  hannay  he is an enthusiast  we like him very much  but we don t see  much of him       you must beware of him  miss hannay   mr  hunter said   or he will  inoculate you with some of his fads  i do not say that he is not right   but he sees the immensity of the need for change  but does not see fully  the immensity of the difficulty in bringing it about       there is no fear of his inoculating me  that is to say of setting me to  work  for what could one woman do       nothing  my dear   her uncle said   if all the white women in india  threw themselves into the work  they could do little  the natives are  too jealous of what they consider intruders  the parsees are about the  only progressive people  while ladies are welcome enough when they pay  a visit of ceremony to the zenana of a native  if they were to try to  teach their wives to be discontented with their lots  for that is  what it would be  they would be no longer welcome  schools are being  established  but at present these are but a drop in the ocean  still   the work does go on  and in time something will be done  it is of no use  bothering yourself about it  isobel  it is best to take matters as you  find them      isobel made no answer  but she was much disappointed when dr  wade   dropping in to tiffin  said his guest had started two hours before  for deennugghur  he had a batch of letters and reports from his native  clerk  and there was something or other that he said he must see to at  once      he begged me to say  major  that he was very sorry to go off without  saying goodby  but he hoped to be in cawnpore before long  i own that  that part of the message astonished me  knowing as i do what difficulty  there is in getting him out of his shell  he and i became great chums  when i was over at deennugghur two years ago  and the young fellow is  not given to making friends  however  as he is not the man to say a  thing without meaning it  i suppose he intends to come over again  he  knows there is always a bed for him in my place       we see very little of him   mary hunter said   he is always away on  horseback all day  sometimes he comes in the evening when we are quite  alone  but he will never stay long  he always excuses himself on the  ground that he has a report to write or something of that sort  amy and  i call him  timon of athens        there is nothing of timon about him   the doctor remarked dogmatically    that is the way with you young ladies  you think that a man s first  business in life is to be dancing attendance on you  bathurst looks at  life seriously  and no wonder  going about as he does among the natives  and listening to their stories and complaints  he puts his hand to the  plow  and does not turn to the right or left       still  doctor  you must allow   mrs  hunter said gravely   that mr   bathurst is not like most other men       certainly not   the doctor remarked   he takes no interest in sport of  any kind  he does not care for society  he very rarely goes to the club   and never touches a card when he does  and yet he is the sort of man one  would think would throw himself into what is going on  he is a strong   active  healthy man  whom one would expect to excel in all sorts of  sports  he is certainly good looking  he talks extremely well  and is  i  should say  very well read and intelligent       he can be very amusing when he likes  doctor  once or twice when he has  been with us he has seemed to forget himself  as it were  and was full  of fun and life  you must allow that it is a little singular that a man  like this should altogether avoid society  and night and day be absorbed  in his work       i have thought sometimes   mr  hunter said   that bathurst must have  had some great trouble in his life  of what nature i can  of course   form no idea  he was little more than twenty when he came out here  so i  should say that it was hardly a love affair       that is always the way  hunter  if a man goes his own way  and that way  does not happen to be the way of the mess  it is supposed that he must  have had trouble of some sort  as bathurst is the son of a distinguished  soldier  and is now the owner of a fine property at home  i don t see  what trouble he can have had  he may possibly  for anything i know  have  had some boyish love affairs  but i don t think he is the sort of man to  allow his whole life to be affected by any foolery of that sort  he is  simply an enthusiast      it is good for mankind that there should be some enthusiasts  i grant  that it would be an unpleasant world if we were all enthusiasts  but  the sight of a man like him throwing his whole life and energy into his  work  and wearing himself out trying to lessen the evils he sees  around him  ought to do good to us all  look at these boys   and he  apostrophized wilson and richards  as they appeared together at the  door   what do they think of but amusing themselves and shirking their  duties as far as possible       oh  i say  doctor   wilson exclaimed  astonished at this sudden attack    what are you pitching into us like that for  that is not fair  is it   major  we amuse ourselves  of course  when there is nothing else to do   but i am sure we don t shirk our work  you don t want us to spend our  spare time in reading greek  i suppose       no  but you might spend some of it very profitably in learning some of  these native languages   the doctor said   i don t believe that you know  above a dozen native words now  you can shout for brandy and water  and  for a light for your cigars  but i fancy that that is about the extent  of it       we are going to have a moonshee next week  doctor   wilson said  a  little crestfallen   and a horrid nuisance it will be       that is only because you are obliged to pass in the vernacular  wilson   so you need not take any credit to yourself on that account       doctor  you are in one of your worst possible tempers this morning    isobel said   you snap at us all round  you are quite intolerable this  morning       i am rather put out by bathurst running away in this fashion  miss  hannay  i had made up my mind that he would stop three or four days  longer  and it is pleasant to have someone who can talk and think about  something besides horses and balls  but i will go away  i don t want to  be the disturbing element  and i have no doubt that richards is burning  to tell you the odds on some of the horses today       shall we see you on the racecourse  doctor   the major asked  as the  doctor moved towards the door      you will not  major  one day is enough for me  if they would get up a  donkey race confined strictly to the subalterns of the station  i might  take the trouble to go and look at it       the doctor is in great form today   wilson said good temperedly  after  the laugh which followed the doctor s exit had subsided   and i am sure  we did nothing to provoke him       you got into his line of fire  wilson   the major said   he is  explosive this morning  and has been giving it to us all round  however   nobody minds what the doctor says  his bark is very bad  but he has  no bite  wait till you are down with the fever  and you will find him  devote himself to you as if he were your father       he is one of the kindest men in the world   isobel agreed warmly   thereby effectually silencing richards  who had just pulled up his shirt  collar preparatory to a sarcastic utterance respecting him     isobel  indeed  was in full sympathy with the doctor  for she  too  was  disappointed at bathurst s sudden departure  she had looked forward to  learning a good deal from him about the native customs and ways  and  had intended to have a long talk with him  she was perhaps  too  more  interested generally in the man himself than she would have been willing  to admit     that evening the party went to an entertainment at bithoor  isobel and  the girls were delighted with the illuminations of the gardens and with  the palace itself  with its mixture of eastern splendor and european  luxury  but isobel did not altogether enjoy the evening      i suppose i ought to congratulate you on your success last night   isobel   dr  wade said  when he dropped in after breakfast   everyone  has been telling me that the rajah paid you the greatest attention   and that there is the fiercest gnashing of teeth among what must now be  called the ex queens of the station       i don t know who told you such nonsense  doctor   isobel replied hotly    the rajah quite spoilt the evening for me  i have been telling mrs   hunter so  if we had not been in his own house  i should have told him  that i should enjoy the evening very much more if he would leave me  alone and let me go about and look quietly at the place and the gardens   which are really beautiful  no doubt he is pleasant enough  and i  suppose i ought to have felt flattered at his walking about with me and  so on  but i am sure i did not  what pleasure does he suppose an english  girl can have in listening to elaborate compliments from a man as yellow  as a guinea       think of his wealth  my dear       what difference does his wealth make   isobel said   as far as i have  seen  i do not think that rich englishmen are more amusing than others   and if he had all the wealth of india  that would not improve nana sahib  in my eyes  there are women  of course  who do think a great deal about  money  and who will even marry men for it  but even women who would  do that could not  i should think  care anything about the wealth of a  hindoo they cannot marry       not directly  my dear   mrs  hunter said   but people may be flattered  with the notice and admiration of a person of importance and great  wealth  even if he is a hindoo       besides   the doctor put in   the rajah is considered to be a great  connoisseur of english beauty  and has frequently expressed his deep  regret that his religion prevented his marrying an english lady       i should be very sorry for the english girl who would marry him   religion or not       i think you are rather hard upon the nana  isobel   the major said    he is a general favorite  he is open handed and liberal  very fond of  entertaining  a great admirer of us as a nation  he is a wonderfully  well read man for a hindoo  can talk upon almost every subject  and is  really a pleasant fellow       i don t like him  i don t like him at all   isobel said positively      ah  that is only because you thought he made you a little more  conspicuous than you liked by his attentions to you  isobel       no  indeed  uncle  that was very silly and ridiculous  but i did not  like the man himself  putting that aside altogether  it was like talking  to a man with a mask on  it gave me a creepy feeling  it did not seem to  me that one single word he said was sincere  but that he was acting  and  over and over again as he was talking i said to myself   what is this  man really like  i know he is not the least bit in the world what he  pretends to be  but what is the reality   i felt just the same as i  should if i had one of those great snakes they bring to our veranda  coiling round me  the creature might look quiet enough  but i should  know that if it were to tighten it would crush me in a moment      the major and mrs  hunter both laughed at her earnestness  but the  doctor said gravely   is that really how you felt about him when he was  talking to you  miss hannay  i am sorry to hear you say that  i own  that my opinion has been that of everyone here  that the rajah is a good  fellow and a firm friend of the europeans  and my only doubt has arisen  from the fact that it was unnatural he should like us when he has  considerable grounds for grievance against us  we have always relied  upon his influence  which is great among his countrymen  being thrown  entirely into the scale on our side if any trouble should ever arise   but i own that what you say makes me doubt him  i would always take the  opinion of a dog or a child about anyone in preference to my own       you are not very complimentary  doctor   isobel laughed      well  my dear  a young girl who has not mixed much in the world and had  her instincts blunted is in that respect very much like a child  she may  be deceived  and constantly is deceived where her heart is concerned   and is liable to be taken in by any plausible scoundrel  but where her  heart is not concerned her instincts are true  when i see children and  dogs stick to a man i am convinced that he is all right  though i may  not personally have taken to him  when i see a dog put his tail between  his legs and decline to accept the advances of a man  and when i see  children slip away from him as soon as they can  i distrust him at once   however pleasant a fellow he may be  as the rajah  from all i heard   certainly laid himself out to be agreeable to you last night  and yet in  spite of that you felt as you say you did about him  i am bound to say  that without at once admitting that my impressions about him were  wrong  i consider that there is good ground for thinking the matter over  again       what nonsense  doctor   the major laughed   everyone here has known the  rajah for years  he is a most popular man  everyone likes him  among the  ladies especially he is a great favorite  it is ridiculous to suggest  that everyone should have been wrong about him  merely because isobel  takes a prejudice against him  and that as far as i can see is simply  because his admiration for her was somewhat marked      isobel gave a little shudder   don t talk about admiration  uncle  that  is not the word for it  i don t know what it was like  they say snakes  fascinate birds before they eat them by fixing their eyes upon them  i  should say it was something of that sort of look       well  my dear  he is not going to eat you  that is certain   the major  said   and i can assure you that his approbation goes for a great  deal here  and that after this you will go up several pegs in cawnpore  society      isobel tossed her head   then i am sorry for cawnpore society  it is  a matter of entire indifference to me whether i go up or down in its  opinion      a fortnight later the nana gave another entertainment  a good deal to  her uncle s vexation  isobel refused to go when the time came      but what am i to say  my dear   he asked in some perplexity      you can say anything you like  uncle  you can say that i am feeling the  heat and have got a bad headache  which is true  or you can say that  i don t care for gayety  which is also true  i shall be very much more  comfortable and happy at home by myself      the hunters had by this time returned to deennugghur  and the major  drove over to bithoor accompanied only by dr  wade  he was rather  surprised when the doctor said he would go  as it was very seldom that  he went out to such entertainments      i am not going to amuse myself  major  i want to have a good look at  the nana again  i am not comfortable since isobel gave us her opinion  of him  he is an important personage  and if there is any truth in these  rumors about disaffection among the sepoys his friendship may be of the  greatest assistance to us      so the doctor was with major hannay when the latter made his excuses for  isobel s absence on the ground that she was not feeling very well     the nana expressed great regret at the news  and said that with the  major s permission he would call in the morning to inquire after miss  hannay s health      he did not like it   the doctor said  when they had strolled away  together   he was very civil and polite  but i could see that he was  savage  i fancy he got up this fete principally in her honor  it is not  often he has two so close together       oh  that is nonsense  doctor       i don t think so  he has done the same sort of thing several times  before  when he has been specially taken by some fresh face from  england      others besides the doctor remarked that the rajah was not quite himself  that evening  he was courteous and polite to his guests  but he was  irritable with his own people  and something had evidently gone wrong  with him     the next day he called at the major s  the latter had not told isobel  of his intention  for he guessed that had he done so she would have gone  across to mrs  doolan or one of her lady friends  and she was sitting in  the veranda with him and young wilson when the carriage drove up      i was so sorry to hear that you were unwell  miss hannay   the nana  said courteously   it was a great disappointment to me that you were  unable to accompany your uncle last night       i have been feeling the heat the last few days   isobel said quietly    and  indeed  i do not care much about going out in such hot weather  as this  i have not been accustomed to much society in england  and the  crowd and the heat and the lights make my head ache       you look the picture of health  miss hannay  but i know that it is  trying for englishwomen when they first come into our climate  it is  always a great pleasure to me to receive english ladies at bithoor  i  hope upon the next occasion you will be able to come       i am much obliged to your highness   she said   but it would be a truer  kindness to let me stay quietly at home       but that is selfish of you  miss hannay  you should think a little of  the pleasure of others as well as your own       i am not conceited enough to suppose that it could make any difference  to other people s pleasure whether i am at a party or not   isobel said    i suppose you mean that as a compliment  rajah  but i am not accustomed  to compliments  and don t like them       you will have to learn to become accustomed to compliments  miss  hannay   the rajah said  with a smile  and then turning to the doctor   began to tell him of a tiger that had been doing a great deal of harm  at a village some thirty miles away  and offered to send some elephants  over to organize a hunt for him if he liked  an invitation that the  doctor promptly accepted     the visit was but a short one  the rajah soon took his leave      you are wrong altogether  isobel   the doctor said   i have returned to  my conviction that the rajah is a first rate fellow       that is just because he offered you some shooting  doctor   isobel said  indignantly   i thought better of you than to suppose that you could be  bought over so easily as that       she had you there  doctor   the major laughed   however  i am glad that  you will no longer be backing her in her fancies       why did you accept his invitation for us to go over and lunch there   uncle   isobel asked  in a tone of annoyance      because there was no reason in the world why we should refuse  my dear   he very often has luncheon parties  and after that he will show you over  the place  and exhibit his jewels and curiosities  he said there would  be other ladies there  and i have no doubt we shall have a very pleasant  day      even isobel was obliged to confess that the visit was a pleasant one   the nana had asked mrs  cromarty  her daughters  and most of the other  ladies of the regiment  with their husbands  the lunch was a banquet   and after it was over the parties were taken round the place  paid a  visit to the zenana  inspected the gardens and stables  and were driven  through the park  the nana saw that isobel objected to be particularly  noticed  and had the tact to make his attentions so general that even  she could find no fault with him     on the drive back she admitted to her uncle that she had enjoyed her  visit very much  and that the rajah s manners were those of a perfect  gentleman      but mind  uncle   she said   i do not retract my opinion  what the  rajah really is i don t pretend to know  but i am quite sure that the  character of a smiling host is not his real one  and that for some  reason or other he is simply playing a part       i had no idea that you were such a prejudiced little woman   the major  said  somewhat vexed   but as it is no use arguing with you we had  better drop the subject      for the next month cawnpore suffered a little from the reaction  after the gayety of the races  but there was no lack of topics of  conversation  for the rumors of disaffection among the troops gained in  strength  and although nothing positive was known  and everyone scoffed  at the notion of any serious trouble  the subject was so important a  one that little else was talked of whenever parties of the ladies got  together         chapter viii        i have some bad news  isobel  at least i suppose you will consider it  bad news   the major said one morning  when he returned from the orderly  room   you heard me say that four companies were going to relieve those  at deennugghur  well  i am going with them  it seems that the general is  of opinion that in the present unsettled state of affairs there ought to  be a field officer in command there  so i have to go  for myself i don t  mind  but you will find it dull in a small station like that  after the  gayeties of cawnpore       i don t mind a bit  uncle  in that respect  i don t think i care  much for gayeties  but of course the move will be a trouble  we have  everything so nice here  it will be horrid having to leave it all  how  long will it be for       six months  in the ordinary state of things  though of course something  may occur to bring us in before that  still  the change won t be as much  trouble as you fancy  when we get there you can stay for two or three  days with the hunters till we have got the things to rights  there is  one thing that you will be pleased about  wade is going with us  at any  rate for the present  you are a favorite of his  you know  and i think  that is the principal reason for his going  at any rate  when he heard i  was in orders  he told the colonel that  as there was no illness in the  regiment  he thought  if he did not object  he would change places for  a bit with m alaster  the assistant surgeon  who has been with the  detachment at deennugghur for the last year  so as to give him a turn  of duty at cawnpore  and do a little shikaring himself  there is more  jungle and better shooting round deennugghur than there is here  and you  know the doctor is an enthusiast that way  of course  the colonel agreed  at once       i am very glad of that  uncle  it won t seem like going to a strange  place if we have him with us  and the hunters there  and i suppose three  or four officers of the regiment  who are going       both your boys   the major laughed   and doolan and rintoul       when do we go  uncle       next monday  i shall get somebody to put us up from friday  and that  morning we will get everything dismantled here  and send them off by  bullock carts with the servants to deennugghur  so that they will be  there by monday morning  i will write to hunter to pick us out the best  of the empty bungalows  and see that our fellows get to work to clean  the place up as soon as they arrive  we shall be two days on the march   and things will be pretty forward by the time we get there       and where shall we sleep on the march       in tents  my dear  and very comfortable you will find them  rumzan will  go with us  and you will find everything go on as smoothly as if you  were here  tent life in india is very pleasant  next year  in the cool  season  we will do an excursion somewhere  and i am sure you will find  it delightful  they don t know anything about the capabilities of tents  at home       then do i quite understand  uncle  that all i have got to do is to make  a round of calls to say goodby to everyone       that is all  you will find a lot of my cards in one of those pigeon  holes  you may as well drop one wherever you go  shall i order a  carriage from framjee s for today       no  i think not  uncle  i will go round to our own bungalows first  and  hear what mrs  doolan and the others think about it      at mrs  doolan s isobel found quite an assembly  mrs  rintoul had come  in almost in tears  and the two young lieutenants had dropped in with  captain doolan  while one or two other officers had come round to  commiserate with mrs  doolan      another victim   the latter said  as isobel entered      you look too cheerful  miss hannay  i find that we are expected to wear  sad countenances at our approaching banishment       are we  mrs  doolan  it seems to me that it won t make very much  difference to us       not make any difference  miss hannay   captain doolan said   why   deennugghur is one of the dullest little stations on this side of  india       what do you mean by dull  captain doolan       why  there are only about six white residents there besides the troops   of course  as four companies are going instead of one  it will make  a difference  but there will be no gayety  no excitement  and really  nothing to do       as for the gayety  i am sure i shall not regret it  captain doolan   besides  our gayeties are pretty well over  except  of course  dinner  parties  and it is getting very hot for them  we shall get off having to  go out in the heat of the day to make calls  which seem to me terrible  afflictions  and i think with a small party it ought to be very sociable  and pleasant  as for excitement  i hear that there is much better  shooting there than there is here  mrs  hunter was telling me that they  have had some tigers that have been very troublesome round there  and  you will all have an opportunity of showing your skill and bravery   i know that mr  richards and mr  wilson are burning to distinguish  themselves       it would be great fun to shoot a tiger   richards said   when i came  out to india i thought there was going to be lots of tiger shooting  and  i bought a rifle on purpose  but i have never had a chance yet  yes  we  will certainly get up a tiger hunt  won t we  wilson  you will tell us  how to set about it  won t you  doolan       i don t shoot   captain doolan said   and if i wanted to  i am not sure  that my wife would give me leave       certainly i would not   mrs  doolan said promptly   married men have no  right to run into unnecessary danger       dr  wade will be able to put you in the way  mr  richards   isobel  said      dr  wade   mrs  rintoul exclaimed   you don t mean to say  miss hannay   that he is going with us       yes  he is going for a time  mrs  rintoul  my uncle told me that he had  applied to go with the detachment  and that the surgeon there would come  back to the regiment while he is away       i do call that hard   mrs  rintoul said   the only thing i was glad we  were going for was that we should be under mr  m alaster  who is very  pleasant  and quite understands my case  while dr  wade does not seem to  understand it at all  and is always so very brusque and unsympathetic      there was a general smile      wade is worth a hundred of m alaster   captain roberts said   there is  not a man out here i would rather trust myself to if i were ill  he is  an awfully good fellow  too  all round  though he may be  as you say  a  little brusque in manner       i call him a downright bear   mrs  rintoul said angrily   why  only  last week he told me that if i would get up two hours earlier and go for  a brisk walk just after sunrise  and give up eating meat at tiffin  and  confine myself to two or three dishes at dinner  i should be perfectly  well in the course of a month  just as if i was in the habit of  overeating myself  when i have scarcely the appetite of a sparrow  i  told captain rintoul afterwards that i must consult someone else  for  that really i could not bear such rudeness       i am afraid we are all against you  mrs  rintoul   mrs  doolan said   with a little shake of her head at isobel  who was  she saw  going to  speak out strongly   no one could possibly be kinder than he is when  anyone is really ill  i mean seriously ill   she added  as mrs  rintoul  drew herself up indignantly   i shall never forget how attentive he was  to the children when they were down with fever just before he went to  england  he missed his ship and lost a month of his leave because he  would not go away till they were out of danger  and there are very few  men who would have done that  i shall never forget his kindness  and now  let us talk of something else  you will have to establish a little mess  on your own account  mr  wilson  as both the captains are married men   and the major has also an incumbrance       yes  it will be horribly dull  mrs  doolan  richards and i have  quarters together here  and  of course  it will be the same there  and  i am sure i don t know what we shall find to talk about when we come to  have to mess together  of course  here  there are the messroom and the  club  and so we get on very well  but to be together always will be  awful       you will really have to take to reading or something of that sort  mr   wilson   isobel laughed      i always do read the field  miss hannay  but that won t last for a  whole week  you know  and there is no billiard table  and no racquet  court  or anything else at deennugghur  and one cannot always be riding  about the country       we shall all have to take pity on you as much as we can   mrs  doolan  said   i must say that  like miss hannay  i shall not object to the  change       i think it is all very well for you  mrs  doolan  you have children       well  mr  richards  i will let you both  as a great treat  take them  out for a walk sometimes of a morning instead of their going with the  ayah  that will make a change for you      there was a general laugh  but wilson said manfully   very well  mrs   doolan  i am very fond of youngsters  and i should like to take  anyhow   the two eldest out sometimes  i don t think i should make much hand with  the other two  but perhaps richards would like to come in and amuse them  while we are out  he is just the fellow for young ones      there was another laugh  in which richards joined   i could carry them  about on my back  and pretend to be a horse   he said   but i don t know  that i could amuse them in any other way       you would find that very hot work  mr  richards   mrs  doolan said    but i don t think we shall require such a sacrifice of you  well  i  don t think we shall find it so bad  after all  and i don t suppose  it will be for very long  i do not believe in all this talk about  chupaties  and disaffection  and that sort of thing  i expect in three  months we shall most of us be back again      ten days later the detachment was settled down in deennugghur   the troops were for the most part under canvas  for there was only  accommodation for a single company at the station  the two subalterns  occupied a large square tent  while the other three officers took  possession of the only three bungalows that were vacant at the station   the doctor having a tent to himself  the major and isobel had stayed  for the first three days with the hunters  at the end of which time the  bungalow had been put in perfect order  it was far less commodious than  that at cawnpore  but isobel was well satisfied with it when all their  belongings had been arranged  and she soon declared that she greatly  preferred deennugghur to cawnpore     those at the station heartily welcomed the accession to their numbers   and there was an entire absence of the stiffness and formality of a  large cantonment like cawnpore  and isobel was free to run in as she  chose to spend the morning chatting and working with the hunters  or  mrs  doolan  or with the other ladies  of whom there were three at the  station     a few days after their arrival news came in that the famous man eater   which had for a time ceased his ravages and moved off to a different  part of the country  principally because the natives of the village  near the jungle had ceased altogether to go out after nightfall  had  returned  and had carried off herdsmen on two consecutive days     the doctor at once prepared for action  and agreed to allow wilson and  richards to accompany him  and the next day the three rode off together  to narkeet  to which village the two herdsmen had belonged  both had  been killed near the same spot  and the natives had traced the return of  the tiger to its lair in the jungle with its victims     the doctor soon found that the ordinary methods of destroying the tiger  had been tried again and again without success  cattle and goats had  been tied up  and the native shikaris had taken their posts in trees  close by  and had watched all night  but in vain  spring traps  and deadfalls had also been tried  but the tiger seemed absolutely  indifferent to the attractions of their baits  and always on the lookout  for snares  the attempts made at a dozen villages near the jungle had  all been equally unsuccessful      it is evident   the doctor said   that the brute cares for nothing but  human victims  no doubt  if he were very hungry he would take a cow or  a goat  but we might wait a very long time for that  so the only thing  that i can see is to act as a bait myself       how will you do that  doctor       i shall build a sort of cage near the point where the tiger has twice  entered the jungle  i will take with me in the cage a woman or girl from  the village  from time to time she shall cry out as if in pain  and  as the tiger is evidently somewhere in this neighborhood it is likely  enough he will come out to see about it      we must have the cage pretty strong  or i shall never get anyone to sit  with me  besides  on a dark night  there is no calculating on killing  to a certainty with the first shot  and it is just as well to be on the  safe side  in daylight it would be a different matter altogether  i can  rely upon my weapon when i can see  but on a dark night it is pretty  well guesswork      the villagers were at once engaged to erect a stout cage eight feet  square and four high  of beams driven into the ground six inches apart   and roofed in with strong bars  there was a considerable difficulty in  getting anyone to consent to sit by the doctor  but at last the widow  of one of the men who had been killed agreed for the sum of twenty five  rupees to pass the night there  accompanied by her child four years old     the doctor s skill with his rifle was notorious  and it was rather the  desire of seeing her husband s death avenged than for the sake of the  money that she consented to keep watch  there was but one tree suitable  for the watchers  it stood some forty yards to the right of the cage   and it was arranged that both the subalterns should take their station  in it      now look here  lads   the doctor said   before we start on this  business  it must be quite settled that you do not fire till you hear  my rifle  that is the first thing  the second is that you only fire when  the brute is a fair distance from the cage  if you get excited and blaze  away anyhow  you are quite as likely to hit me as you are the tiger   now  i object to take any risk whatever on that score  you will have a  native shikari in the tree with you to point out the tiger  for it is  twenty to one against your making him out for yourselves  it will be  quite indistinct  and you have no chance of making out its head or  anything of that sort  and you have to take a shot at it as best you  may      remember there must not be a word spoken  if the brute does come   it will probably make two or three turns round the cage before it  approaches it  and may likely enough pass close to you  but in no case  fire  you can t make sure of killing it  and if it were only wounded  it would make off into the jungle  and all our trouble would be thrown  away  also remember you must not smoke  the tiger would smell it half  a mile away  and  besides  the sound of a match striking would be quite  sufficient to set him on his guard       there is no objection  i hope  doctor  to our taking up our flasks  we  shall want something to keep us from going to sleep       no  there is no objection to that   the doctor said   but mind you  don t go to sleep  for if you did you might fall off your bough and  break your neck  to say nothing of the chance of the tiger happening to  be close at hand at the time      late in the afternoon the doctor went down to inspect the cage  and  pronounced it sufficiently strong  half an hour before nightfall he and  the woman and child took their places in it  and the two beams in the  roof that had been left unfastened to allow of their entry were securely  lashed in their places by the villagers  wilson and richards were helped  up into the tree  and took their places upon two boughs which sprang  from the trunk close to each other at a height of some twelve feet from  the ground  the shikari who was to wait with them crawled out  and with  a hatchet chopped off some of the small boughs and foliage so as to give  them a clear view of the ground for some distance round the cage  which  was erected in the center of a patch of brushwood  the lower portion  of which had been cleared out so that the doctor should have an  uninterrupted view round  the boughs and leaves were gathered up by the  villagers  and carried away by them  and the watch began      confound it   richards whispered to his companion after night fell   it  is getting as dark as pitch  i can scarcely make out the clump where the  cage is  i should hardly see an elephant if it were to come  much less a  brute like a tiger       we shall get accustomed to it presently   wilson replied   at any rate  make quite sure of the direction in which the cage is in  it is better  to let twenty tigers go than to run the risk of hitting the doctor      in another hour their eyes had become accustomed to the darkness  and  they could not only see the clump in which the cage was clearly  but  could make out the outline of the bush all round the open space in which  it stood  both started as a loud and dismal wail rose suddenly in the  air  followed by a violent crying      by jove  how that woman made me jump   wilson said   it sounded quite  awful  and she must have pinched that poor little beggar of hers pretty  sharply to make him yell like that      a low  hush   from the shikari at his elbow warned wilson that he  was speaking too loudly  hours passed by  the cries being raised at  intervals      it is enough to give one the jumps  richards  each time she yells i  nearly fall off my branch       keep on listening  then it won t startle you       a fellow can t keep on listening   wilson grumbled   i listen each time  until my ears begin to sing  and i feel stupid and sleepy  and then she  goes off again like a steam whistle  that child will be black and blue  all over in the morning      a warning hiss from the shikari again induced wilson to silence      i don t believe the brute is coming   he whispered  an hour later   if  it wasn t for this bough being so hard i should drop off to sleep  my  eyes ache with staring at those bushes      as he spoke the shikari touched him on the shoulder and pointed    tiger   he whispered  and then did the same to richards  grasping their  rifles  they gazed in the direction in which he pointed  but could for  some time make out nothing  then they saw a dim gray mass in front of  the bushes  directly on the opposite side of the open space  then from  the cage  lying almost in a direct line between it and them  rose the  cry of the child  they were neither of them at all certain that the  object at which they were gazing was the tiger  it seemed shapeless   the outline fading away in the bush  but they felt sure that they had  noticed nothing like it in that direction before     for two or three minutes they remained in uncertainty  then the outline  seemed to broaden  and it moved noiselessly  there could be no mistake  now  the tiger had been attracted by the cries  and as it moved along  they could see that it was making a circuit of the spot from whence the  sounds proceeded  to reconnoiter before advancing towards its prey  it  kept close to the line of bushes  and sometimes passed behind some of  them  the shikari pressed their shoulders  and a low hiss enforced the  necessity for absolute silence  the two young fellows almost held  their breath  they had lost sight of the tiger now  but knew it must be  approaching them     for two or three minutes they heard and saw nothing  then the shikari  pointed beyond them  and they almost started as they saw the tiger  retreating  and knew that it must have passed almost under them without  their noticing it  at last it reached the spot at which they had first  seen it  the child s cry  but this time low and querulous  again rose   with quicker steps than before it moved on  but still not directly  towards the center  to the great relief of the two subalterns  who had  feared that it might attack from such a direction that they would not  dare to fire for fear of hitting the cage  fortunately it passed that  point  and  crouching  moved towards the bushes     wilson and richards had their rifles now at their shoulders  but  in the  feeble and uncertain light  felt by no means sure of hitting their  mark  though it was but some thirty yards away  almost breathlessly they  listened for the doctor s rifle  but both started when the flash and  sharp crack broke on the stillness  there was a sudden snarl of pain   the tiger gave a spring in the air  and then fell  rolling over and  over      it is not killed   the shikari exclaimed   fire when it gets up      suddenly it rose to its feet  and with a loud roar sprang towards the  thicket  the two subalterns fired  but the movements of the dimly seen  creature were so swift that they felt by no means sure that they had hit  it  then came  almost simultaneously  a loud shriek from the woman  of  a very different character to the long wails she had before uttered   followed by a sound of rending and tearing      he is breaking down the cage   richards exclaimed excitedly  as he and  wilson hastened to ram another cartridge down their rifles   come  we  must go and help the doctor      but a moment later came another report of a rifle  and then all was  silent  then the doctor s voice was heard      don t get down from the tree yet  lads  i think he is dead  but it is  best to make sure first      there was a pause  and then another rifle shot  followed by the shout   all right  he is as dead as a door nail now  mind your rifles as you  climb down       fancy thinking of that   wilson said   when you have just killed a  tiger  i haven t capped mine yet  have you  richards       i have just put it on  but will take it off again  here  old man  you  get down first  and we will hand the guns to you    this to the shikari     with some difficulty they scrambled down from the tree      now we may as well cap our rifles   richards said   the brute may not  be dead after all      they approached the bush cautiously      you are quite sure he is dead  doctor       quite sure  do you think i don t know when a tiger is dead      still holding their guns in readiness to fire  they approached the  bushes      you can do no good until the villagers come with torches   the  doctor said   the tiger is dead enough  but it is always as well to be  prudent      the shikari had uttered a loud cry as he sprang down from the tree  and  this had been answered by shouts from the distance  in a few minutes  lights were seen through the trees  and a score of men with torches and  lanterns ran up with shouts of satisfaction     as soon as they arrived the two young officers advanced to the cage   on the top a tiger was lying stretched out as if in sleep  with some  caution they approached it and flashed a torch in its eyes  there was  no doubt that it was dead  the body was quickly rolled off the cage  and  then a dozen hands cut the lashing and lifted the top bars  which was  deeply scored by the tiger s claws  and the doctor emerged      i am glad to be out of that   he said   six hours in a cage with a  woman and a crying brat is no joke      as soon as the doctor had got out  the subalterns eagerly examined the  tiger  upon which the natives were heaping curses and execrations      how many wounds has it got   they asked the doctor  who repeated the  question to the shikari in his own language      three  sahib  one full in the chest  it would have been mortal  two  others in the ribs by the heart       no others   the subalterns exclaimed in disgust  as the answer was  translated to them  the doctor himself examined the tiger      no  you both missed  lads  but you need not be ashamed of that  it is  no easy matter to hit a tiger even at a short distance on a dark night  like this  when you can scarce make him out  and can t see the barrel of  your rifle  i ought to have told you to rub a little phosphorus off the  head of a match onto the sight  i am so accustomed to do it myself as  a matter of course that i did not think of telling you  well  i am  heartily glad we have killed it  for by all accounts it has done an  immense deal of damage       it has been a fine tiger in its time  although its skin doesn t look  much   wilson said   there are patches of fur off       that is generally the case with man eaters  they are mostly old tigers  who take  when they get past their strength  to killing men  i don t  know whether the flesh doesn t agree with them  but they are almost  always mangy       we were afraid for a moment   richards said   that the tiger was going  to break into your cage  we heard him clawing away at the timber  and as  you didn t fire again we were afraid something was the matter       the mother was   the doctor said testily   the moment the tiger sprang   the woman threw herself down at full length right on the top of my  second rifle  and when i went to push her off i think she fancied the  tiger had got hold of her  for she gave a yell that fairly made me jump   i had to push her off by main force  and then lie down on my back  so as  to get the rifle up to fire  i was sure the first shot was fatal  for i  knew just where his heart would be  but i dropped a second cartridge in   and gave him another bullet so as to make sure  well  if either of  you want his head or his claws  you had better say so at once  for the  natives will be singeing his whiskers off directly  the practice is a  superstition of theirs       no  i don t want them   wilson said   if i had put a bullet into the  brute  so that i could have said i helped to kill him  i should have  liked the head to get it preserved and sent home to my people  but as it  is the natives are welcome to it as far as i am concerned      richards was of the same opinion  and so without further delay they  started back for the village  where  upon their arrival  they were  greeted with cries of joy by the women  the news having already been  carried back by a boy      poor beggars   the doctor said   they have been living a life of terror  for weeks  they must feel as if they had woke from a nightmare  now   lads  we will have some supper  i dare say you are ready for it  and i  am sure i am       is there any chance for supper  doctor   why  it must be two o clock in  the morning       of course there is   the doctor replied   i gave orders to my man to  begin to warm up the food as soon as he heard a gun fired  and i will  guarantee he has got everything ready by this time      after a hearty meal and a cigar they lay down for a few hours  sleep   and at daybreak rode back to deennugghur  the two subalterns rather  crestfallen at their failure to have taken any active part in killing  the tiger that had so long been a terror to the district      it was an awful sell missing him  miss hannay  i wanted to have had the  claws mounted as a necklace  i thought you would have liked it       i am very much obliged to you  mr  wilson  but i would much rather not  have had them  if the tiger hadn t been a man eater i should not have  minded  but i should never have worn as an ornament claws that had  killed lots of people  women and children too       no  i never thought of that  miss hannay  it wouldn t have been  pleasant  now one thinks of it  still  i wish i had put a bullet into  him       no doubt you will do better next time  mr  wilson  the doctor has been  telling me that it is extremely difficult to hit an animal in the dark  when you are not accustomed to that sort of shooting  he says he was in  a great fright all the time he was lying in the cage  and that it was an  immense relief to him when he heard your rifles go off  and found that  he wasn t hit       that is too bad of him  miss hannay   wilson laughed   we were not such  duffers as all that  i don t believe he really did think so       i am sure he was in earnest  mr  wilson  he said he should have felt  quite safe if it had been daylight  but that in the dark people really  can t see which way the rifles are pointed  and that he remembered he  had not told you to put phosphorus on the sights       it was too bad of him   wilson grumbled   it would have served him  right if one of the bullets had hit a timber of the cage and given him  a start  i should like to have seen the doctor struggling in the dark  to get his second rifle from under the woman  with the tiger clawing and  growling two feet above him       the doctor didn t tell me about that   isobel laughed   though he said  he had a woman and child with him to attract the tiger       it would have frightened any decent minded tiger  miss hannay  instead  of attracting it  for such dismal yells as that woman made i never  listened to  i nearly tumbled off the tree at the first of them  it made  me jump so  and it gave me a feeling of cold water running down my back   as to the child  i don t know whether she pinched it or the doctor stuck  pins into it  but the poor little brute howled in the most frightful  way  i don t think i shall ever want to go tiger shooting in the dark  again  i ache all over today as if i had been playing in the first  football match of the season  from sitting balancing myself on that  branch  i was almost over half a dozen times       i expect you nearly went off to sleep  mr  wilson       i think i should have gone to sleep if it hadn t been for that woman   miss hannay  i should not have minded if i could have smoked  but to  sit there hour after hour and not be able to smoke  and not allowed to  speak  and staring all the time into the darkness till your eyes ached   was trying  i can tell you  and after all that  not to hit the brute was  too bad      the days passed quietly at deennugghur  they were seldom alone at major  hannay s bungalow in the evening  for wilson and richards generally came  in to smoke a cigar in the veranda  the doctor was a regular visitor   when he was not away in pursuit of game  and bathurst was also often one  of the party      mr  bathurst is coming out wonderfully  miss hannay   mrs  hunter  said one day  as isobel sat working with her  while the two girls were  practicing duets on a piano in the next room   we used to call him  the hermit  he was so difficult to get out of his cell  we were quite  surprised when he accepted our invitation to dinner yesterday       i think dr  wade has stirred him up   isobel said calmly   he is a  great favorite of the doctor s      mrs  hunter smiled over her work   perhaps so  my dear  anyhow  i am  glad he has come out  and i hope he won t retire into his cell again  after you have all gone       i suppose it depends a good deal upon his work   isobel said      my experience of men is that they can always make time if they like  my  dear  when a man says he is too busy to do this  that  or the other  you  may always safely put it down that he doesn t want to do it  of course   it is just the same thing with ourselves  you often hear women say they  are too busy to attend to all sorts of things that they ought to attend  to  but the same women can find plenty of time to go to every pleasure  gathering that comes off  there is no doubt that mr  bathurst is really  fond of work  and that he is an indefatigable civil servant of the  company  but that would not prevent him making an hour or two s time  of an evening  occasionally  if he wanted to  however  he seems to have  turned over a new leaf  and i hope it will last  in a small station like  this  even one man is of importance  especially when he is as pleasant  as mr  bathurst can be when he likes  he was in the army at one time   you know       was he  mrs  hunter       yes  i never heard him say so himself  but i have heard so from several  people  i think he was only in it for a year or so  i suppose he did not  care for it  and can quite imagine he would not  so he sold out  and  a short time afterwards obtained a civil appointment  he has very good  interest  his father was general bathurst  who was  you know  a very  distinguished officer  so he had no difficulty in getting into our  service  where he is entirely in his element  his father died two  years ago  and i believe he came into a good property at home  everyone  expected he would have thrown up his appointment  but it made no  difference to him  and he just went on as before  working as if he had  to depend entirely on the service       i can quite understand that   isobel said   to a really earnest man  a life of usefulness here must be vastly preferable to living at home  without anything to do or any object in life       well  perhaps so  my dear  and in theory that is  no doubt  the case   but practically  i fancy you would find nineteen men out of twenty  even  if they are what you call earnest men  retire from the ranks of hard  workers if they come into a nice property  by the way  you must come in  here this evening  there is a juggler in the station  and mr  hunter has  told him to come round  the servants say the man is a very celebrated  juggler  one of the best in india  and as the girls have never seen  anything better than the ordinary itinerant conjurers  my husband has  arranged for him to come in here  and we have been sending notes round  asking everyone to come in  we have sent one round to your place  but  you must have come out before the chit arrived       oh  i should like that very much   isobel said   two or three men came  to our bungalow at cawnpore and did some conjuring  but it was nothing  particular  but uncle says some of them do wonderful things  things that  he cannot account for at all  that was one of the things i read about at  school  and thought i should like to see  more than anything in india   when i was at school we went in a body  two or three times  to see  conjurers when they came to cheltenham  of course i did not understand  the things they did  and they seemed wonderful to me  but i know there  are people who can explain them  and that they are only tricks  but  i have read accounts of things done by jugglers in india that seemed  utterly impossible to explain  really a sort of magic       i have heard a good many arguments about it   mrs  hunter said   and  a good many people  especially those who have seen most of them  are  of opinion that many of the feats of the indian jugglers cannot be  explained by any natural laws we know of  i have seen some very curious  things myself  but the very fact that i did not understand how they were  done was no proof they could not be explained  certainly two of their  commonest tricks  the basket trick and the mango  have never been  explained  our conjurers at home can do something like them  but then  that is on a stage  where they can have trapdoors and all sorts of  things  while these are done anywhere  in a garden  on a road  where  there could be no possible preparation  and with a crowd of lookers on  all round  it makes me quite uncomfortable to look at it       well  i must be off now  mrs  hunter  it is nearly time for uncle to be  back  and he likes me to be in when he returns          chapter ix       dr  wade was sitting in the veranda smoking and reading an english paper  that had arrived by that morning s mail  when isobel returned      good morning  doctor  is uncle back       not yet  he told me he might be half an hour late  and that i was to  come round and amuse you until he came back       so in my absence you have been amusing yourself  doctor  i have been  round at mrs  hunter s  she is going to have a juggler there this  evening  and we are all to go       yes  i got a chit from her this morning  i have seen scores of them   but i make a point of never missing an exhibition when i get the chance   i hate anything i don t understand  and i go with the faint hope of  being able to find things out  though i know perfectly well that i shall  not do so       then you think it is not all quite natural  doctor       i don t say it is not natural  because we don t know what all the  natural laws are  but i say that some of the things i have seen  certainly are not to be accounted for by anything we do know  it is not  often that the jugglers show their best tricks to the whites  they know  that  as a rule  we are altogether skeptical  but i have seen at native  courts more than once the most astounding things  things absolutely  incomprehensible and inexplicable  i don t suppose we are going to see  anything of that sort tonight  though mrs  hunter said in her note that  they had heard from the native servant that this man was a famous one      there is a sect of people in india  i don t mean a caste  but a sort  of secret society  who  i believe  claim to be able by some sort of  influence to suspend altogether the laws of nature  i do not say that  i believe them  as a scientific man  it is my duty not to believe  them  but i have seen such things done by some of the higher class of  jugglers  and that under circumstances that did not seem to admit of  the possibility of deception  that i am obliged to suspend my judgment   which  as you may imagine  my dear  is exceedingly annoying to me  but  some of them do possess to a considerable extent what the scotch call  second sight  that is to say  the power of foreseeing events in the  future  of that i am morally certain  i have seen proofs of it over and  over again  for example  once an old fakir  whom i had cured of a badly  ulcerated limb  came up just as i was starting on a shooting expedition       do not go out today   he said   i foresee evil for you  i saw you last  night brought back badly wounded        but if i don t go your dream will come wrong   i said      he shook his head       you will go in spite of what i say   he said   and you will suffer   and others too   and he looked at a group of shikaris  who were standing  together  ready to make a start       how many men are there   he said       why  six of course   i replied       i see only three   he said   and three dull spots  one of those i  see is holding his matchlock on his shoulder  another is examining his  priming  the third is sitting down by the tire  those three will come  back at the end of the day  the other three will not return alive       i felt rather uncomfortable  but i wasn t  as i said to myself  i was a  good deal younger then  my dear  such a fool as to be deterred from what  promised to be a good day s sport by such nonsense as this  and i went      we were going after a rogue elephant that had been doing a lot of  damage among the natives  plantations  we found him  and a savage brute  he turned out to be  he moved just as i fired  and though i hit him  it  was not on the fatal spot  and he charged right down among us  he caught  the very three men the fakir said were doomed  and dashed the life out  of them  then he came at me  the bearer had run off with my second gun   and he seized me and flung me up in the air      i fell in a tree  but broke three of my ribs and one of my arms   fortunately  though the beast tried to get at me  i was out of his  reach  and the tree was too strong for him to knock down  then another  man who was with me came up and killed him  and they got me down and  carried me back  and i was weeks before i was about again  that was  something more than a coincidence  i think  there were some twenty men  out with us  and just the four he had pointed out were hurt  and no  others      i have seen scores of other cases in which these predictions have  come true  especially in cases of disease  though i grant that here the  predictions often bring about their own fulfilment  if a native is told  by a fakir  or holy man  that he is going to die  he makes no struggle  to live  in several cases i have seen natives  whose deaths have been  predicted  die  without  as far as my science could tell me  any disease  or ailment whatever that should have been fatal to them  they simply  sank  died  i should say  from pure fright  but putting aside this  class  i have seen enough to convince me that some at least among these  fanatics do possess the power of second sight       that is very extraordinary  doctor  of course i have heard of second  sight among certain old people in scotland  but i did not believe in  it       i should not have believed in it if i had not seen the same thing here  in india  i naturally have been interested in it  and have read pretty  well everything that has been written about second sight among the  highlanders  and some of the incidents are so well authenticated that i  scarcely see how they can be denied  of course  there is no accounting  for it  but it is possible that among what we may call primitive people  there are certain intuitions or instincts  call them what you like  that  have been lost by civilized people      the power of scent in a dog is something so vastly beyond anything we  can even imagine possible  that though we put it down to instinct  it is  really almost inexplicable  take the case that dogs have been known to  be taken by railway journeys of many hundred miles and to have found  their way home again on foot  there is clearly the possession of a power  which is to us absolutely unaccountable      but here comes your uncle  he will think i have been preaching a sermon  to you if you look so grave      but major hannay was too occupied with his own thoughts to notice  isobel      has anything gone wrong  major   the doctor asked  as he saw his face      i have just learnt   the major said   that some more chupaties were  brought last night  it is most annoying  i have questioned several of  the native officers  and they profess to have no idea whence they came  or what is the meaning of them  i wish we could get to the bottom of  this thing  it keeps the troops in a ferment  if i could get hold of one  of these messengers  i would get out of him all he knew  even if i had  to roast him to make him tell       my dear uncle   isobel said reprovingly   i am sure you don t mean what  you say       i don t know   he said  half laughing   i should certainly consider  myself perfectly justified in taking uncommonly strong steps to try  to get to the bottom of this business  the thing is going on all over  india  and it must mean something  and it is all the worse if taken in  connection with this absurd idea about the greased cartridges  i grant  that it was an act of folly greasing them at all  when we know the  idiotic prejudices the natives have  still  it could hardly have  been foreseen that this stir would have been made  the issue of the  cartridges has been stopped  but when the natives once get an idea into  their minds it is next to impossible to disabuse them of it  it is a  tiresome business altogether       tiffin ready  sahib   rumzan interrupted  coming out onto the veranda      that is right  rumzan  now  isobel  let us think of more pleasant  subjects       we are to go into the hunters  this evening  uncle   isobel said  as  she sat down   there is going to be a famous juggler there  there is a  note for you from mrs  hunter on the side table       very well  my dear  some of these fellows are well worth seeing   bathurst is coming in to dinner  i saw him as he was starting this  morning  just as he was going down to the lines  and he accepted  he  said he should be able to get back in time  however  i don t suppose he  will mind going round with us  i hope you will come  doctor  to make up  the table  i have asked the two boys to come in       i shall have to become a permanent boarder at your establishment   major  it is really useless my keeping a cook when i am in here nearly  half my time  but i will come  i am off for three days tomorrow  a  villager came in this morning to beg me to go out to rid them of a  tiger that has established himself in their neighborhood  and that is an  invitation i never refuse  if i can possibly manage to make time for it   fortunately everyone is so healthy here at present that i can be very  well spared      at dinner the subject of juggling came up again  and the two subalterns  expressed their opinion strongly that it was all humbug      dr  wade believes in it  mr  wilson   isobel said      you don t say so  doctor  i should have thought you were the last sort  of man who would have believed in conjurers       it requires a wise man to believe  wilson   the doctor said   any fool  can scoff  the wise man questions  when you have been here as long as  i have  and if you ever get as much sense as i have  which is doubtful   you may be less positive in your ideas  if you can call them ideas       that is one for me   wilson said good humoredly  while the others  laughed      well  i have never seen them  doctor  except those fellows who come  around to the veranda  and i have seen conjurers at home do ever so much  better tricks than they       what do you think of them  mr  bathurst   isobel asked   i suppose you  have seen some of the better sort       i do not know what to think of them  miss hannay  i used to be rather  of wilson s opinion  but i have seen things since that i could not  account for at all  there was a man here two or three months back who  astounded me       mrs  hunter said that the girls had had no opportunity of seeing a good  conjurer since they came out  mr  bathurst  i suppose they did know this  man you are speaking of being here       he was only here for a few hours  miss hannay  i had happened to  meet him before  and he gave me a private performance  which was quite  different to anything i have ever seen  though i had often heard of the  feats he had performed  i was so impressed with them that i can assure  you that for a few days i had great difficulty in keeping my mind upon  my work       what did he do  mr  bathurst      bathurst related the feat of the disappearing girl      she must have jumped down when you were not looking   richards said   with an air or conviction      possibly   bathurst replied quietly   but as i was within three or  four yards of the pole  and it was perfectly distinct in the light of my  lamp  and as i certainly saw her till she was some thirty or forty  feet up in the air i don t see how she can have managed it  for  even  supposing she could have sprung down that distance without being hurt   she would not have come down so noiselessly that i should not have heard  her       still  if she did not come down that way  how could she have come    wilson said      that is exactly what i can t make out   bathurst replied   if it should  happen to be the same man  and he will do the same thing again  i fancy  you will be as much puzzled as i was      after dinner was over the party walked across to mr  hunter s bungalow   where  in a short time  the other officers  their wives  and all the  other residents at the station were assembled  chairs were placed in the  veranda for the ladies  and a number of lamps hung on the wall  so that  a strong light was thrown upon the ground in front of it  in addition   four posts had been driven into the ground some twenty feet from the  veranda  and lamps had been fastened upon them      i don t know whether the juggler will like that   mr  hunter said   and  i shan t light them if he objects  i don t think myself it is quite  fair having a light behind him  still  if he agrees  it will be hardly  possible for him to make the slightest movement without being seen      the juggler  who was sitting round at the other side of the house  was  now called up  he and the girl  who followed him  salaamed deeply  and  made an even deeper bow to bathurst  who was standing behind isobel s  chair      you must have paid them well  bathurst   major hannay said   they have  evidently a lively remembrance of past favors  i suppose they are the  same you were talking about       yes  they are the same people  major   then he said in the native  dialect to the juggler   mr  hunter has put some posts with lamps behind  you  rujub  but he hasn t lit them because he did not know whether you  would object       they can be lighted  sahib  my feats do not depend on darkness  any  of the sahibs who like to stand behind us can do so if they do not come  within the line of those posts       let us go out there   wilson said to richards  when the answer was  translated   we will light the lamps  and we shall see better there than  we shall see here      the two went round to the other side and lit the lamps  and the servants  stood a short distance off on either side     the first trick shown was the well known mango tree  the juggler placed  a seed in the ground  poured some water upon it from a lota  and covered  it with a cloth  in two or three minutes he lifted this  and a plant  four or five inches high was seen  he covered this with a tall basket   which he first handed round for inspection  on removing this a mango  tree some three feet high  in full bloom  was seen  it was again  covered  and when the basket was removed it was seen to be covered with  ripe fruit  eliciting exclamations of astonishment from those among the  spectators who had not before seen the trick performed      now  wilson   the doctor said   perhaps you will be kind enough to  explain to us all how this was done       i have no more idea than adam  doctor       then we will leave it to richards  he promised us at dinner to keep his  eyes well open      richards made no reply      how was it done  mr  bathurst  it seems almost like a miracle       i am as ignorant as wilson is  miss hannay  i can t account for it in  any way  and i have seen it done a score of times  ah  now he is going  to do the basket trick  don t be alarmed when you hear the girl cry  out  you may be quite sure that she is not hurt  the father is deeply  attached to her  and would not hurt a hair of her head      again the usual methods were adopted  the basket was placed on the  ground and the girl stepped into it  without the pretense of fear  usually exhibited by the performers     before the trick began major hannay said to captain doolan   come round  with me to the side of those boys  i know the first time i saw it done  i was nearly throwing myself on the juggler  and wilson is a hot headed  boy  and is likely as not to do so  if he did  the man would probably go  off in a huff and show us nothing more  from what bathurst said  we are  likely to see something unusual      as soon as the lid was put down  an apparently angry colloquy took place  between the juggler and the girl inside  presently the man appeared to  become enraged  and snatching up a long  straight sword from the ground   ran it three or four times through the basket     a loud shriek followed the first thrust  and then all was silent     some of the ladies rose to their feet with a cry of horror  isobel among  them  wilson and richards both started to rush forward  but were seized  by the collars by the major and captain doolan      will you open the basket   the juggler said quietly to mrs  hunter  as  she had seen the trick before she stepped forward without hesitation   opened the lid of the basket and said   it is empty   the juggler took  it up  and held it up  bottom upwards      what on earth has become of the girl   wilson exclaimed     as he spoke she passed between him and richards back to her father s  side      well  i am dashed   wilson murmured   i would not have believed it  if fifty people had sworn to me they had seen it   he was too much  confounded even to reply  when the doctor sarcastically said   we are  waiting for your explanation  gentlemen       will you ask him  major   richards said  as he wiped his forehead with  his pocket handkerchief   to make sure that she is solid      the major translated the request  and the girl at once came across  and  richards touched her with evident doubt as to whether on not she were  really flesh and blood     there was much curiosity among those who had seen jugglers before as  to what would be the next feat  for generally those just seen were the  closing ones of a performance  but as these were the first it seemed  that those to follow must be extraordinary indeed     the next feat was the one shown to bathurst  and was performed exactly  as upon that occasion  except that as the girl rose beyond the circle  of light she remained distinctly visible  a sort of phosphoric light  playing around her  those in the veranda had come out now  the juggler  warning them not to approach within six feet of the pole     higher and higher the girl went  until those below judged her to be at  least a hundred and fifty feet from the ground  then the light died out   and she disappeared from their sight  there was silence for a minute or  two  and then the end of the pole could be seen descending without  her  another minute  and it was reduced to the length it had been at  starting     the spectators were silent now  the whole thing was so strange and  mysterious that they had no words to express their feeling     the juggler said something which mr  hunter translated to be a request  for all to resume their places      that is a wonderful trick   the doctor said to bathurst   i have never  seen it done that way before  but i once saw a juggler throw up a rope  into the air  how high it went i don t know  for  like this  it was done  at night  but it stood up perfectly stiff  and the juggler s attendant  climbed up  he went higher and higher  and we could hear his voice  coming down to us  at last it stopped  and then suddenly the rope fell  in coils on the ground  and the boy walked quietly in  just as that girl  has done now      the girl now placed herself in the center of the open space      you will please not to speak while this trick is being performed   the  juggler said   harm might come of it  watch the ground near her feet      a minute later a dark object made its appearance from the ground  it  rose higher and higher with an undulating movement      by jove  it is a python   the doctor whispered in bathurst s ear  a  similar exclamation broke from several of the others  but the juggler  waved his hand with an authoritative hush  the snake rose until its head  towered above that of the girl  and then began to twine itself round  her  continuously rising from the ground until it enveloped her with  five coils  each thicker than a man s arm  it raised its head above hers  and hissed loudly and angrily  then its tail began to descend  gradually  the coils unwound themselves  lower and lower it descended until it  disappeared altogether     it was some time before anyone spoke  so great was the feeling of  wonder  the doctor was the first to break the silence      i have never seen that before   he said   though i have heard of it  from a native rajah       would the sahibs like to see more   the juggler asked     the two miss hunters  mrs  rintoul  and several of the others said they  had seen enough  but among the men there was expressed a general wish to  see another feat      i would not have missed this for anything   the doctor said   it would  be simple madness to throw away such a chance      the ladies  therefore  with the exception of mrs  hunter  mrs  doolan   and isobel  retired into the house      you must all go on one side now   the juggler said   for it is only on  one side what i am now going to do can be seen      he then proceeded to light a fire of charcoal  when he had done this   he said   the lights must now be extinguished and the curtains drawn  so  that the light will not stream out from the house      as soon as this was done he poured a powder over the fire  and by its  faint light the cloud of white smoke could be seen      now i will show you the past   he said   who speaks      there was silence  and then dr  wade said   show me my past      a faint light stole up over the smoke  it grew brighter and brighter   and then a picture was clearly seen upon it     it was the sea  a house standing by itself in a garden  and separated  from the water only by a road  presently the figure of a girl appeared  at the gate  and  stepping out  looked down the road as if waiting for  someone  they could make out all the details of her dress and see her  features distinctly  a low exclamation broke from the doctor  then the  picture gradually faded away      the future   the juggler said  and gradually an indian scene appeared  on the smoke  it was a long  straight road  bordered by a jungle  a  native was seen approaching  he paused in the foreground      that is you  doctor   mr  hunter exclaimed   you are got up as a  native  but it s you      almost at the same moment two figures came out from the jungle  they  were also in native dress      you and miss hannay   the doctor said in a low tone to bathurst    dressed like a native and dyed   but no one else detected the disguise   and the picture again faded away      that is enough  rujub   bathurst said  for he felt isobel lean back  heavily against the hand which he held at the back of her chair  and  felt sure that she had fainted      draw back the curtains  someone  i fancy this has been too much for  miss hannay      the curtains were thrown back  and mrs  hunter  running in  brought out  a lamp  the doctor had already taken his place by isobel s side      yes  she has fainted   he said to bathurst   carry her in her chair as  she is  so that she may be in the room when she comes to      this was done      now  gentlemen   the doctor said   you had better light the lamps again  out here  and leave the ladies and me to get miss hannay round      when the lamps were lit it was evident that the whole of the men were a  good deal shaken by what they had seen      well   mr  hunter said   they told me he was a famous juggler  but that  beat anything i have seen before  i have heard of such things frequently  from natives  but it is very seldom that europeans get a chance of  seeing them       i don t want to see anything of the sort again   major hannay said    it shakes one s notions of things in general  i fancy  hunter  that  we shall want a strong peg all round to steady our nerves  i own that i  feel as shaky as a boy who thinks he sees a ghost on his way through a  churchyard      there was a general murmur of agreement and the materials were quickly  brought      well  wilson  what do you and richards think of it   the major went on   after he had braced himself up with a strong glass of brandy and water    i should imagine you both feel a little less skeptical than you did two  hours ago       i don t know what richards feels  major  but i know i feel like a fool   i am sorry  bathurst  for what i said at dinner  but it really didn t  seem to me to be possible what you told us about the girl going up into  the air and not coming down again  well  after i have seen what i have  seen this evening  i won t disbelieve anything i hear in future about  these natives       it was natural enough that you should be incredulous   bathurst said    i should have been just as skeptical as you were when i first came out   and i have been astonished now  though i have seen some good jugglers  before      at this moment the doctor came out again      miss hannay is all right again now  major  i am not surprised at her  fainting  old hand as i am at these matters  and i think that i have  seen as much or more juggling than any man in india  i felt very queer  myself  specially at the snake business  as i said  i have seen that  ascension trick before  but how it is done i have no more idea than a  child  those smoke scenes  too  are astonishing  of course they could be  accounted for as thrown upon a column of white smoke by a magic lantern   but there was certainly no magic lantern here  the juggler was standing  close to me  and the girl was sitting at his feet  i watched them both  closely  and certainly they had no apparatus about them by which such  views could be thrown on the smoke       you recognized the first scene  i suppose  doctor   bathurst asked      perfectly  it took me back twenty five years  it was a cottage near  sidmouth  and was correct in every minute detail  the figure was that of  the young lady i married four years afterwards  many a time have i seen  her standing just like that  as i went along the road to meet her from  the little inn at which i was stopping  the very pattern of her dress   which i need hardly say has never been in my mind all these years  was  recalled to me      had i been thinking of the scene at the time i could have accounted for  it somehow  upon the theory that in some way or other the juggler was  conscious of my thought and reflected it upon the smoke  how  i don t at  all mean to say  but undoubtedly there exists  to some extent  the power  of thought reading  it is a mysterious subject  and one of which we know  absolutely nothing at present  but maybe in upwards of a hundred years  mankind will have discovered many secrets of nature in that direction   but i certainly was not thinking of that scene when i spoke and said the   past   i had no doubt that he would show me something of the past   but certainly no particular incident passed through my mind before that  picture appeared on the smoke       the other was almost as curious  doctor   captain doolan said   for  it was certainly you masquerading as a native  i believe the other was  bathurst  it struck me so  and he seemed to be running off with some  native girl  what on earth could that all mean       it is no use puzzling ourselves about it   the doctor said   it may or  may not come true  i have no inclination to go about dressed out as a  native at present  but there is no saying what i may come to  there  is quite enough for us to wonder at in the other things  the mango and  basket tricks i have seen a dozen times  and am no nearer now than i  was at first to understanding them  that ascension trick beats me  altogether  and there was something horribly uncanny about the snake       do you think it was a real snake  doctor       that i cannot tell you  richards  every movement was perfectly natural   i could see the working of the ribs as it wound itself round the girl   and the quivering of its tongue as it raised its head above her  at any  other time i should be ready to take my affidavit that it was a python  of unusual size  but at the present moment i should not like to give a  decided opinion about anything connected with the performance       i suppose it is no use asking the juggler any questions  hunter   one  of the other men said      not in the least  they never do answer questions  the higher class of  jugglers treat their art as a sort of religious mystery  and there is  no instance known of their opening their lips  although large sums have  frequently been offered them  in the present case you will certainly ask  no questions  for the man and girl have both disappeared with the box  and apparatus and everything connected with them  they must have  slipped off directly the last trick was over  and before we had the lamp  lighted  i sent after him at once  but the servant could find no signs  of him  i am annoyed because i have not paid them       i am not surprised at that   dr  wade said   it is quite in accordance  with what i have heard of them  they live by exhibiting what you may  call their ordinary tricks  but i have heard from natives that when they  show any what i may call supernatural feats  they do not take money  it  is done to oblige some powerful rajah  and as i have said  it is only on  a very few occasions that europeans have ever seen them  well  we may as  well go in to the ladies  i don t fancy any of them would be inclined to  come out onto the veranda again this evening      no one was indeed inclined even for talk  and in a very short time the  party broke up and returned home      come and smoke a pipe with me  bathurst  before you turn in   the  doctor said  as they went out   i don t think either of us will be  likely to go to sleep for some time  what is your impression of all  this       my impression  certainly  is that it is entirely unaccountable by any  laws with which we are acquainted  doctor       that is just my idea  and always has been since i first saw any  really good juggling out here  i don t believe in the least in anything  supernatural  but i can quite believe that there are many natural laws  of which at present we are entirely ignorant  i believe the knowledge of  them at one time existed  but has been entirely lost  at any rate among  western peoples  the belief in magic is as old as anything we have  knowledge of  the magicians at the court of pharaoh threw down their  rods and turned them into serpents  the witch of endor called up the  spirit of samuel  the greeks  by no means a nation of fools  believed  implicitly in the oracles  coming down to comparatively later times  the  workers of magic burnt their books before st  paul  it doesn t say  mind  you  that those who pretended to work magic did so  but those who worked  magic      early travelers in persia and india have reported things they saw far  surpassing any we have witnessed this evening  and there is certainly a  sect in india at present  or rather a body of men  and those  as far as  i have been able to learn  of an exceptionally intelligent class  who  believe that they possess an almost absolute mastery over the powers of  nature  you see  fifty years back  if anyone had talked about traveling  at fifty miles an hour  or sending a message five thousand miles in a  minute  he would have been regarded as a madman  there may yet be other  discoveries as startling to be made      when i was in england i heard something of a set of people in america  who called themselves spiritualists  some of whom  notably a young man  named home  claimed to have the power of raising themselves through  the air  i am far from saying that such a power exists  it is of course  contrary to what we know of the laws of nature  but should such a power  exist it would account for the disappearance of the girl from the top  of the pole  highland second sight  carried somewhat farther  and united  with the power of conveying the impressions to others  would account  for the pictures on the smoke  that is  supposing them to be true  and  personally i own that i expect they will prove to be true  unlikely as  it may seem that you  i  and miss hannay will ever be going about in  native attire      by this time they had reached the doctor s bungalow  and had comfortably  seated themselves      there is one thing that flashed across me this evening   bathurst said    i told you  that first evening i met miss hannay  that i had a distinct  knowledge of her face  you laughed at me at the time  and it certainly  seemed absurd  but i was convinced i was not wrong  now i know how it  was  i told you at dinner today about the feat of the girl going up and  not coming down again  but i did not tell you  for you can understand it  is a thing that i should not care to talk much about  that he showed me  a picture like those we saw tonight      it was a house standing in a courtyard  with a high wall round it  i  did not particularly observe the house  it was of the ordinary native  type  and might  for anything i know  be the house in the middle of this  station used as a courthouse by hunter  and for keeping stores  and  so on  i don t say it was that  i did not notice it much  there was a  breach in the outside wall  and round it there was a fierce fight going  on  a party of officers and civilians were repelling the assault of a  body of sepoys  on the terraced roof of the house others were standing  firing and looking on  and i think engaged in loading rifles were two or  three women  one of them i particularly noticed  and  now i recall it   her face was that of miss hannay  of that i am absolutely certain       it is curious  lad   the doctor said  after a pause   and the picture   you see  has so far come true that you have made the acquaintance with  one of the actors whom you did not previously know       i did not believe in the truth of it  doctor  and i do not believe in  it now  there was one feature in the fight which was  as i regret to  know  impossible       and what was that  bathurst      bathurst was silent for a time      you are an old friend  doctor  and you will understand my case  and  make more allowances for it than most people would  when i first came  out here i dare say you heard some sort of reports as to why i had left  the army and had afterwards entered the civil service       there were some stupid rumors   the doctor said   that you had gone  home on sick leave just after the battle of chillianwalla  and had then  sold out  because you had shown the white feather  i need not say that i  did not give any credit to it  there is always gossip flying about as to  the reasons a man leaves the army       it was quite true  doctor  it is a hideous thing to say  but  constitutionally i am a coward       i cannot believe it   the doctor said warmly   now that i know you  you  are the last man of whom i would credit such a thing       it is the bane of my life   bathurst went on   it is my misfortune   for i will not allow it is my fault  in many things i am not a coward   i think i could face any danger if the danger were a silent one  but i  cannot stand noise  the report of a gun makes me tremble all over  even  when it is a blank cartridge that is fired  when i was born my father  was in india  a short time before i came into the world my mother had a  great fright  her house in the country was broken into by burglars  who  entered the room and threatened to blow out her brains if she moved   but the alarm was given  the men servants came down armed  there was  a struggle in her room  pistol shots were fired  and the burglars  were overpowered and captured  my mother fainted and was ill for weeks  afterwards  in fact  until the time i was born  and she died a few days  later  never having  the doctor said  recovered from the shock she had  suffered that night      i grew up a weakly  timid boy  the sort of boy that is always bullied  at school  my father  as you know  was a general officer  and did  not return home until i was ten years old  he was naturally much  disappointed in me  and i think that added to my timidity  for it grew  upon me rather than otherwise  morally  i was not a coward  at school i  can say that i never told a lie to avoid punishment  and my readiness to  speak the truth did not add to my popularity among the other boys  and i  used to be called a sneak  which was even more hateful than being called  a coward      as i grew up i shook off my delicacy  and grew  as you see  into a  strong man  i then fought several battles at school  i learnt to ride   and came to have confidence in myself  and though i had no particular  fancy for the army my father s heart was so set on it that i offered no  objection  that the sound of a gun was abhorrent to me i knew  for the  first time my father put a gun in my hand and i fired it  i fainted  and  nothing would persuade me to try again  still i thought that this was  the result of nervousness as to firing it myself  and that i should get  over it in time      a month or two after i was gazetted i went out to india with the  regiment  and arrived just in time to get up by forced marches to take  part in the battle of chillianwalla  the consequence was that up to that  time i literally had heard no musketry practice      of the events of that battle i have no remembrance whatever  from  the moment the first gun was fired to the end of the day i was as one  paralyzed  i saw nothing  i heard nothing  i moved mechanically  but  happily my will or my instinct kept me in my place in the regiment   when all was over  and silence followed the din  i fell to the ground  insensible  happily for me the doctors declared i was in a state of high  fever  and i so remained for a fortnight  as soon as i got better i was  sent down the country  and i at once sent in my papers and went home  no  doubt the affair was talked of  and there were whispers as to the real  cause of my illness  my father was terribly angry when i returned home  and told him the truth of the matter  that his son should be a coward  was naturally an awful blow to him  home was too unhappy to be endured   and when an uncle of mine  who was a director on the company s board   offered me a berth in the civil service  i thankfully accepted it   believing that in that capacity i need never hear a gun fired again      you will understand  then  the anxiety i am feeling owing to these  rumors of disaffection among the sepoys  and the possibility of anything  like a general mutiny      it is not of being killed that i have any fear  upon the contrary  i  have suffered so much in the last eight years from the consciousness  that the reason why i left the army was widely known  that i should  welcome death  if it came to me noiselessly  but the thought that if  there is trouble i shall assuredly not be able to play my part like a  man fills me with absolute horror  and now more than ever      so you will understand now why the picture i saw  in which i was  fighting in the middle of the sepoys  is to me not only improbable  but  simply impossible  it is a horrible story to have to tell  this is the  first time i have opened my lips on the subject since i spoke to my  father  but i know that you  both as a friend and a doctor  will pity  rather than blame me          chapter x       as bathurst brought his story to its conclusion the doctor rose and  placed his hand kindly on his shoulder      i certainly should not think of blaming you  bathurst  what you tell  me is indeed a terrible misfortune  situated as we may be soon  though  i trust and believe that all this talk about the sepoys is moonshine   i own that i am surprised at your story  for i should have said from  my knowledge of you that though  as i could perceive  of a nervous  temperament  you were likely to be cool and collected in danger  but  certainly your failing is no fault of your own       that is but a small consolation to me  doctor  men do not ask why  and wherefore  they simply point the finger of scorn at a coward  the  misfortune is that i am here  i might have lived a hundred lives in  england and never once had occasion to face danger  and i thought that i  should have been equally secure as an indian civilian  now this trouble  is coming upon us       why don t you take your leave  lad  you have been out seven years now  without a day s relaxation  except indeed  the three days you were over  with me at cawnpore  why not apply for a year s leave  you have a good  excuse  too  you did not go home at the death of your father  two years  ago  and could very well plead urgent family affairs requiring your  presence in england       no  i will not do that  doctor  i will not run away from danger again   you understand me  i have not the least fear of the danger  i in no way  hold to my life  i do not think i am afraid of physical pain  it seems  to me that i could undertake any desperate service  i dread it  simply because i know that when the din of battle begins my body will  overmaster my mind  and that i shall be as i was at chillianwalla   completely paralyzed  you wondered tonight why that juggler should have  exhibited feats seldom  almost never  shown to europeans  he did it  to please me  i saved his daughter s life  this is between ourselves   doctor  and is not to go farther  but  riding in from narkeet  i heard a  cry  and  hurrying on  came upon that man eater you shot the other  day  standing over the girl  with her father half beside himself   gesticulating in front of him  i jumped off and attacked the brute  with my heavy hunting whip  and he was so completely astonished that he  turned tail and bolted       the deuce he did   the doctor exclaimed   and yet you talk of being a  coward       no  i do not say that i am a coward generally  as long as i have to  confront danger without noise i believe i could do as well as most men       but why didn t you mention this business with the tiger  bathurst       because  in the first place  it was the work of a mere passing impulse   and in the second  because i should have gained credit for being what i  am not  a brave man  it will be bad enough when the truth becomes  known  but it would be all the worse if i had been trading on a false  reputation  therefore i particularly charged rujub to say nothing about  the affair to anyone       well  putting this for a time aside  bathurst  what do you think of  that curious scene  you and i and miss hannay disguised as natives       taking it with the one i saw of the attack of sepoys upon a house  it  looks to me  doctor  as if there would be a mutiny  and that that mutiny  would be attended with partial success  that a portion of the garrison   at any rate  will escape  and that miss hannay will be traveling down  the country  perhaps to cawnpore  in your charge  while i in some way  shall be with you  perhaps acting as guide       it may possibly be so   the doctor agreed   it is at any rate very  curious  i wonder whether miss hannay recognized herself in the  disguise       i should hope not  doctor  if it all comes true there will be enough  for her to bear without looking forward to that  i should be glad if the  detachment were ordered back to cawnpore       well  i should not have thought that  bathurst       i know what you mean  doctor  but it is for that reason i wish they  were gone  i believe now that you insisted on my coming down to spend  those three days with you at cawnpore specially that i might meet her       that is so  bathurst  i like her so much that i should be very sorry  to see her throw herself away upon some empty headed fool  i like her  greatly  and i was convinced that you were just the man to make her  happy  and as i knew that you had good prospects in england  i thought  it would be a capital match for her  although you are but a young  civilian  and i own that of late i have thought things were going on  very well       perhaps it might have been so  doctor  had it not been for this coming  trouble  which  if our fears are realized  will entirely put an end even  to the possibility of what you are talking about  i shall be shown to  be a coward  and i shall do my best to put myself in the way of being  killed  i should not like to blow my brains out  but if the worst comes  to the worst i will do that rather than go on living after i have again  disgraced myself       you look at it too seriously  bathurst       not a bit of it  doctor  and you know it       but if the sepoys rise  bathurst  why should they harm their officers   they may be discontented  they may have a grievance against the  government  they may refuse to obey orders and may disband  but why on  earth should they attack men who have always been kind to them  whom  they have followed in battle  and against whom they have not as much as  a shadow of complaint       i hope it may be so most sincerely   bathurst said   but one never  can say  i can hardly bring myself to believe that they will attack  the officers  much less injure women and children  still  i have a most  uneasy foreboding of evil       you have heard nothing from the natives as to any coming trouble       nothing at all  doctor  and i am convinced that nothing is known among  them  or at any rate by the great bulk of them  only one person has ever  said a word to me that could indicate a knowledge of coming trouble  and  that was this juggler we saw tonight  i thought nothing of his words at  the time  that picture he showed me of the attack by sepoys first gave  me an idea that his words might mean something  since then we have heard  much more of this discontent  and i am convinced now that the words had  a meaning  they were simple enough  it was merely his assurance  two or  three times repeated  that he would be ready to repay the service i had  rendered him with his life  it might have been a mere phrase  and so i  thought at the time  but i think now he had before him the possibility  of some event occurring in which he might be able to repay the service i  had rendered him       there may have been something in it and there may not   the doctor  said   but  at any rate  bathurst  he ought to be a potent ally  there  doesn t seem any limit to his powers  and he might  for aught one knows   be able to convey you away as he did his daughter      the doctor spoke lightly  and then added   but seriously  the man might  be of service  these jugglers go among people of all classes  they are  like the troubadours of the middle ages  welcomed everywhere  and they  no doubt have every opportunity of learning what is going on  and it may  be that he will be able to give you timely warning should there be any  trouble at hand       that is possible enough   bathurst agreed   well  doctor  i shall be on  horseback at six  so it is time for me to turn in   and taking his hat   walked across to his own bungalow     the doctor sat for some time smoking before he turned into bed  he had  as he had said  heard rumors  when bathurst first came out  that he had  shown the white feather  but he had paid little attention to it at the  time  they had been together at the first station to which bathurst was  appointed when he came out  and he had come to like him greatly  but  his evident disinclination to join in any society  his absorption in his  work  and a certain air of gravity unnatural in a young man of twenty   had puzzled him  he had at the time come to the conclusion that he  must have had some unfortunate love affair  or have got into some very  serious trouble at home  in time that impression had worn off  a young  man speedily recovers from such a blow  however heavy  but no change had  taken place in bathurst  and the doctor had in time become so accustomed  to his manner that he had ceased to wonder over it  now it was all  explained  he sat thinking over it deeply for an hour  and then laid  down his pipe      it is a terrible pity he came out here   he said   of course it is not  his fault in the slightest degree  one might as well blame a man for  being born a hunchback  but if there should be a row out here it will be  terrible for him  i can quite understand his feeling about it  if i were  placed as he is  and were called upon to fight  i should take a dose  of prussic acid at once  men talk  about their civilization  but we  are little better than savages in our instincts  courage is an almost  useless virtue in a civilized community  but if it is called for  we  despise a man in whom it is wanting  just as heartily as our tattooed  ancestors did  of course  in him it is a purely constitutional failing   and i have no doubt he would be as brave as a lion in any other  circumstances  in fact  the incident of his attacking the tiger with  that dog whip of his shows that he is so  and yet  if he should fail  when the lives of women are at stake it would be a kindness to give him  that dose of prussic acid  especially as isobel hannay will be here   that is the hardest part of it to him  i can see      three days later the force at deennugghur was increased by the arrival  of a troop of native cavalry  under a captain forster  who had just  returned from leave in england      do you know captain forster  doctor   isobel hannay asked  on the  afternoon of his arrival   uncle tells me he is coming to dinner       then you must look after your heart  my dear  he is one of the best  looking fellows out here  a dashing soldier  and a devoted servant of  the fair sex       you don t like him  doctor   isobel said quietly      i have not said so  my dear  far from it  i think i said a good deal  for him       yes  but you don t like him  doctor  why is that       i suppose because he is not my sort of man   the doctor said   i have  not seen him since his regiment and ours were at delhi together  and we  did not see much of each other then  our tastes did not lie in the same  direction       well  i know what your tastes are  doctor  what are his       i will leave you to find out  my dear  he is all i told you  a very  handsome man  with  as is perhaps natural  a very good opinion of  himself  and he distinguished himself more than once in the punjaub  by acts of personal gallantry  i have no doubt he thinks it an awful  nuisance coming to a quiet little station like this  and he will  probably try to while away his time by making himself very agreeable to  you  but i don t think you need quite believe all that he says       i have long ago got over the weakness of believing people s flattery   doctor  however  now you have forewarned me i am forearmed      the doctor hesitated  and then said gravely   it is not my habit to  speak ill of people  my dear  you do me the justice to believe that       i am sure it is not  doctor       well  child  in a station like this you must see a good deal of this  man  he is a man who has won many hearts  and thrown them away  don t  let him win yours  he is not a good man  he has been mixed up in several  grave scandals  he has been the ruin of more than one young man at cards  and billiards  he is in all respects a dangerous man  anatomically i  suppose he has a heart  morally he has not a vestige of one  whatever  you do  child  don t let him make you like him       i don t think there is much fear of that  doctor  after what you have  said   she replied  with a quiet smile   and i am obliged to you indeed  for warning me       i know i am an old fool for meddling  but you know  my dear  i feel  a sort of personal relationship to you  after your having been in my  charge for six months  i don t know a single man in all india whom i  would not rather see you fall in love with than with captain forster       i thought uncle did not seem particularly pleased  when he came in to  tiffin  and said there was a new arrival       i should think not   the doctor said   the man in notoriously a  dangerous fellow  and yet  as he has never actually outstepped what are  considered the bounds which constitute an officer and a gentleman  he  has retained his commission  but it has been a pretty close shave once  or twice  your uncle must know all about him  everyone does  but i don t  suppose the major will open his mouth to you on the subject  he is one  of those chivalrous sort of men who never thinks evil of anyone unless  he is absolutely obliged to  but in a case like this i think he is  wrong  at any rate  i have done what i consider to be my duty in the  matter  now i leave it in your hands  i am glad to see that you are  looking quite yourself again  and have got over your fainting fit of  the other night  i quite expected to be sent for professionally the next  morning       oh  yes  i have quite got over it  doctor  i can t make out how i was  so silly as to faint  i never did such a thing before  but it was so  strange and mysterious that i felt quite bewildered  and the picture  quite frightened me  but i don t know why  this is the first chance i  have had since of speaking to you alone  what do you think of it  and  why should you be dressed up as a native  and why should   she stopped  with a heightened color on her cheeks      you and bathurst be dressed up  too  so you noticed your own likeness   nobody else but bathurst and myself recognized the two figures that came  out of the wood       oh  you saw it too  doctor  i thought i might have been mistaken  for   besides being stained  the face was all obscured somehow  neither uncle   nor mrs  hunter  nor the girls  nor anyone else i have spoken to seem to  have had an idea it was me  though they all recognized you   what could  it mean       i  have not the slightest idea in the world   the doctor said   very  likely it meant nothing  i certainly should not think any more about it   these jugglers  tricks are curious and unaccountable  but it is no use  our worrying ourselves about them  maybe we are all going to get up  private theatricals some day  and perform an indian drama  i have never  taken any part in tomfooleries of that sort so far  but there is no  saying what i may come to       are you going to dine here  doctor       no  my dear  the major asked me to come in  but i declined  i told him  frankly that i did not like forster  and that the less i saw of him the  better i should be pleased      the other guests turned out to be captain and mrs  doolan and mr   congreave  one of the civilians at the station  the doolans arrived  first      you have not seen captain forster yet  isobel   mrs  doolan said  as  they sat down for a chat together   i met him at delhi soon after i came  out  he is quite my beau ideal of a soldier in appearance  but i don t  think he is nice  isobel  i have heard all sorts of stories about him       is that meant as a warning for me  mrs  doolan   isobel asked  smiling      well  yes  i think it is  if you don t mind my giving you one  there  are some men one can flirt with as much as one likes  and there are some  men one can t  he is one of that sort  privately  my dear  i don t mind  telling you that at one time i did flirt with him  i had been accustomed  to flirt in ireland  we all flirt there  and mean nothing by it  but i  had to give it up very suddenly  it wouldn t do  my dear  at all  his  ideas of flirtation differed utterly from mine  i found i was playing  with fire  and was fortunate in getting off without singeing my wings   which is more than a good many others would have done       he must be a horrid sort of man   isobel said indignantly     mrs  doolan laughed   i don t think you will find him so  certainly  that is not the general opinion of women  however  you will see him for  yourself in a very few minutes      isobel looked up with some curiosity when captain forster was announced   and at once admitted to herself that the doctor s report as to his  personal appearance was fully justified  he stood over six feet high   with a powerful frame  and an easy careless bearing  his hair was cut  rather close  he wore a long tawny mustache  his eyes were dark  his  teeth very white and perfect  a momentary look of surprise came across  his face as his eyes fell on isobel      i had hardly expected   he said  as the major introduced him to her    to find no less than three unmarried ladies at deennugghur  i had the  pleasure of being introduced to the miss hunters this afternoon  how do  you do  mrs  doolan  i think it is four years since i had the pleasure  of knowing you in delhi       i believe that is the number  captain forster       it seems a very long time to me   he said      i thought you would say that   she laughed   it was quite the proper  thing to say  captain forster  but i have no doubt it does seem longer  to you than it does to me as you have been home since       we are all here   the major broke in   captain forster  will you take  my niece in       i suppose you find this very dull after cawnpore  miss hannay   captain  forster asked      indeed i do not   isobel said   i like it better here  everything is  sociable and pleasant  while at cawnpore there was much more formality   of course  there were lots of dinner parties  but i don t care for large  dinner parties at all  it is so hot  and they last such a time  i think  six is quite large enough  then there is a general talk  and everyone  can join in just as much as they like  while at a large dinner you  have to rely entirely upon one person  and i think it is very hard work  having to talk for an hour and a half to a stranger of whom you know  nothing  don t you agree with me       entirely  miss hannay  i am a pretty good hand at talking  but at times  i have found it very hard work  i can assure you  especially when  you take down a stranger to the station  so that you have no mutual  acquaintance to pull to pieces      the dinner was bright and pleasant  and when the evening was over isobel  said to her uncle   i think captain forster is very amusing  uncle       yes   the major agreed   he is a good talker  a regular society man  he  is no great favorite of mine  i think he will be a little too much for  us in a small station like this       how do you mean too much  uncle      the major hesitated      well  he won t have much to do with his troop of horse  and time will  hang heavy on his hands       well  there is shooting  uncle       yes  there is shooting  but i don t think that is much in his line   tiffins and calls  and society generally occupy most of his time  i  fancy  and i think he is fonder of billiards and cards than is good for  him or others  of course  being here by himself  as he is  we must do  our best to be civil to him  and that sort of thing  but if we were  at cawnpore he is a man i should not care about being intimate in the  house       i understand  uncle  but certainly he is pleasant       oh  yes  he is very pleasant   the major said dryly  in a tone that  seemed to express that forster s power of making himself pleasant was by  no means a recommendation in his eyes     but captain forster had apparently no idea whatever that his society  could be anything but welcome  and called the next day after luncheon      i have been leaving my pasteboard at all the residents   he said   not  a very large circle  of course  i knew mrs  rintoul at delhi  as well  as mrs  doolan  i did not know any of the others  they seem pleasant  people       they are very pleasant   isobel said      i left one for a man named bathurst  he was out  is that the bathurst   major hannay  who was in a line regiment  i forget its number  and left  very suddenly in the middle of the fighting in the punjaub       yes  i believe bathurst was in the army about that time   the major  said   but i don t know anything about the circumstances of his  leaving      had captain forster known the major better he would have been aware that  what he meant to say was that he did not wish to know  but he did not  detect the inflection of his voice  and went on   they say he showed  the white feather  if it is the same man  i was at school with him  and  unless he has improved since then  i am sure i have no wish to renew his  acquaintance       i like him very much   the major said shortly   he is great friends  with dr  wade  who has the very highest opinion of him  and i believe he  is generally considered to be one of the most rising young officers of  his grade       oh  i have nothing to say against him   captain forster said   but he  was a poor creature at school  and i do not think that there was any  love lost between us  did you know him before you came here       i only met him at the last races in cawnpore   the major said   he was  stopping with the doctor       quite a character  wade      isobel s tongue was untied now      i think he is one of the kindest and best gentlemen i ever met   the  girl said hotly   he took care of me coming out here  and no one could  have been kinder than he was       i have no doubt he is all that   captain forster said gently   still he  is a character  miss hannay  taking the term character to mean a person  who differs widely from other people  i believe he is very skillful in  his profession  but i take it he is a sort of abernethy  and tells the  most startling truths to his patients       that i can quite imagine   isobel said   the doctor hates humbug of  all sorts  and i don t think i should like to call him in myself for an  imaginary ailment       i rather put my foot in it there   captain forster said to himself  as  he sauntered back to his tent   the major didn t like my saying anything  against bathurst  and the girl did not like my remark about the doctor   i wonder whether she objected also to what i said about that fellow  bathurst  a sneaking little hound he was  and there is no doubt about  his showing the white feather in the punjaub  however  i don t think  that young lady is of the sort to care about a coward  and if she asks  any questions  as i dare say she will  after what i have said  she will  find that the story is a true one  what a pretty little thing she is   i did not see a prettier face all the time i was at home  what with her  and mrs  doolan  time is not likely to hang so heavily here as i had  expected      the major  afraid that isobel might ask him some questions about this  story of bathurst leaving the army  went off hastily as soon as captain  forster had left  isobel sat impatiently tapping the floor with her  foot  awaiting the doctor  who usually came for half an hour s chat in  the afternoon      well  child  how did your dinner go off yesterday  and what did you  think of your new visitor  i saw him come away from here half an hour  ago  i suppose he has been calling       i don t like him at all   isobel said decidedly      no  well  then  you are an exception to the general rule       i thought him pleasant enough last night   isobel said frankly   he has  a deferential sort of way about him when he speaks to one that one can  hardly help liking  but he made me angry today  in the first place   doctor  he said you were a character      the doctor chuckled   well  that is true enough  my dear  there was no  harm in that       and then he said   and she broke off   he said what i feel sure cannot  be true  he said that mr  bathurst left the army because he showed the  white feather  it is not true  is it  i am sure it can t be true      the doctor did not reply immediately      it is an old story   he said presently   and ought not to have been  brought up again  i don t suppose forster or anyone else knows the  rights of the case  when a man leaves his regiment and retires when it  is upon active service  there are sure to be spiteful stories getting  about  often without the slightest foundation  but even if it had been  true  it would hardly be to bathurst s disadvantage now he is no longer  in the army  and courage is not a vital necessity on the part of a  civilian       you can t mean that  doctor  surely every man ought to be brave  could  anyone possibly respect a man who is a coward  i don t believe it   doctor  for a moment       courage  my dear  is not a universal endowment  it is a physical as  much as a moral virtue  some people are physically brave and  morally cowards  others are exactly the reverse  some people are  constitutionally cowards all round  while in others cowardice shows  itself only partially  i have known a man who is as brave as a lion in  battle  but is terrified by a rat  i have known a man brave in other  respects lose his nerve altogether in a thunderstorm  in neither of  these cases was it the man s own fault  it was constitutional  and by no  effort could he conquer it  i consider bathurst to be an exceptionally  noble character  i am sure that he is capable of acts of great bravery  in some directions  but it is possible that he is  like the man i have  spoken of  constitutionally weak in others       but the great thing is to be brave in battle  doctor  you would not  call a man a coward simply because he was afraid of a rat  but you would  call a man a coward who was afraid in battle  to be a coward there seems  to me to be a coward all round  i have always thought the one virtue  in man i really envied was bravery  and that a coward was the most  despicable creature living  it might not be his actual fault  but one  can t help that  it is not anyone s fault if he is fearfully ugly or  born an idiot  for example  but cowardice seems somehow different  not  to be brave when he is strong seems to put a man below the level of a  woman  i feel sure  doctor  there must be some mistake  and that this  story cannot be true  i have seen a good deal of mr  bathurst since we  have been here  and you have always spoken so well of him  he is the  last man i should have thought would be  would be like that       i know the circumstances of the case  child  you can trust me when  i say that there is nothing in bathurst s conduct that diminishes my  respect for him in the slightest degree  and that in some respects he is  as brave a man as any i know       yes  doctor  all that may be  but you do not answer my question  did  mr  bathurst leave the army because he showed cowardice  if he did  and  you know it  why did you invite him here  why did you always praise  him  why did you not say   in other respects this man may be good and  estimable  but he is that most despicable thing  a coward       there was such a passion of pain in her voice and face that the doctor  only said quietly   i did not know it  my dear  or i should have told  you at first that in this one point he was wanting  it is  i consider   the duty of those who know things to speak out  but he is certainly not  what you say      isobel tossed her head impatiently   we need not discuss it  doctor  it  is nothing to me whether mr  bathurst is brave or not  only it is not  quite pleasant to learn that you have been getting on friendly terms  with a man who        don t say any more   the doctor broke in   you might at least remember  he is a friend of mine  there is no occasion for us to quarrel  my dear   and to prevent the possibility of such a thing i will be off at once      after he had left isobel sat down to think over what had been said  he  had not directly answered her questions  but he had not denied that the  rumor that bathurst had retired from the army because he was wanting in  courage was well founded  everything he had said  in fact  was an excuse  rather than a denial  the doctor was as stanch a friend as he was bitter  an opponent  could he have denied it he would have done so strongly and  indignantly     it was clear that  much as he liked bathurst  he believed him wanting in  physical courage  he had said  indeed  that he believed he was brave in  some respects  and had asserted that he knew of one exceptional act of  courage that he had performed  but what was that if a man had had to  leave the army because he was a coward  to isobel it seemed that of all  things it was most dreadful that a man should be wanting in courage   tales of daring and bravery had always been her special delight  and   being full of life and spirit herself  it had not seemed even possible  to her that a gentleman could be a coward  and that bathurst could be so  was to her well nigh incredible     it might  as the doctor had urged  be in no way his fault  but this did  not affect the fact  he might be more to be pitied than to be blamed   but pity of that kind  so far from being akin to love  was destructive  of it     unconsciously she had raised bathurst on a lofty pinnacle  the doctor  had spoken very highly of him  she had admired the energy with which   instead of caring  as others did  for pleasure  he devoted himself to  his work  older men than himself listened to his opinions  his quiet and  somewhat restrained manner was in contrast to the careless fun and good  humor of most of those with whom she came in contact  it had seemed to  her that he was a strong man  one who could be relied upon implicitly at  all times  and she had come in the few weeks she had been at deennugghur  to rely upon his opinion  and to look forward to his visits  and even to  acknowledge to herself that he approached her ideal of what a man should  be more than anyone else she had met     and now this was all shattered at a blow  he was wanting in man s first  attribute  he had left the army  if not in disgrace  at least under  a cloud and even his warm friend  the doctor  could not deny that the  accusation of cowardice was well founded  the pain of the discovery  opened her eyes to the fact which she had not before  even remotely   admitted to herself  that she was beginning to love him  and the  discovery was a bitter one      i may thank captain forster for that  at least   she said to herself   as she angrily wiped a tear from her cheek   he has opened my eyes in  time  what should i have felt if i had found too late that i had come  to love a man who was a coward  who had left the army because he was  afraid  i should have despised myself as much as i should despise him   well  that is my first lesson  i shall not trust in appearances again   why  i would rather marry a man like captain forster  even if everything  they say about him is true  than a man who is a coward  at least he is  brave  and has shown himself so      the doctor had gone away in a state of extreme irritation      confound the meddling scoundrel   he said to himself  as he surprised  the horse with a sharp cut of the whip   just when things were going  on as i wished  i had quite set my mind on it  and though i am sure  bathurst would never have spoken to her till he had told her himself  about that unfortunate failing of his  it would have been altogether  different coming from his own lips just as he told it to me  of course   my lips were sealed and i could not put the case in the right light  i  would give three months  pay for the satisfaction of horsewhipping that  fellow forster  still  i can t say he did it maliciously  for he could  not have known bathurst was intimate there  or that there was anything  between them  the question is  am i to tell bathurst that she has heard  about it  i suppose i had better  ah  here is the major   and he drew up  his horse      anything new  major  you look put out       yes  there is very bad news  doctor  a sowar has just brought a letter  to me from the colonel saying that the general has got a telegram  that the   th native infantry at berhampore have refused to use the  cartridges served out to them  and that yesterday a sepoy of the   th  at barrackpore raised seditious cries in front of the lines  and when  baugh  the adjutant  and the sergeant major attempted to seize him he  wounded them both  while the regiment stood by and refused to aid them   the   th are to be disbanded  and no doubt the   th will be  too       that is bad news indeed  major  and looks as if this talk about general  disaffection were true  had there been trouble but at one station it  might have been the effect of some local grievance  but happening at  two places  it looks as if it were part of a general plot  well  we must  hope it will go no farther       it is very bad   said the major   but at any rate we may hope we shall  have no troubles here  the regiment has always behaved well  and i am  sure they have no reason to complain of their treatment  if the colonel  has a fault  it is that of over leniency with the men       that is so   the doctor agreed   but the fact is  major  we know  really very little about the hindoo mind  we can say with some sort of  certainty what europeans will do under given circumstances  but though  i know the natives  i think  pretty nearly as well as most men  i feel  that i really know nothing about them  they appear mild and submissive   and have certainly proved faithful on a hundred battlefields  but we  don t know whether that is their real character  their own history   before we stepped in and altered its current  shows them as faithless   bloodthirsty and cruel  whether they have changed their nature under our  rule  or simply disguised it  heaven only knows       at any rate   the major said   they have always shown themselves  attached to their english officers  there are numberless instances where  they have displayed the utmost devotion for them  and although some  scheming intriguers may have sown the seeds of discontent among them   and these lies about the cartridges may have excited their religious  prejudices  and may even lead them to mutiny  i cannot believe for an  instant that the sepoys will lift their hands against their officers       i hope not   the doctor said gravely   a tiger s cub  when tamed  is  one of the prettiest of playthings  but when it once tastes blood it is  as savage a beast as its mother was before it  of course  i hope for the  best  but if the sepoys once break loose i would not answer for anything  they might do  they have been pretty well spoilt  major  till they have  come to believe that it is they who conquered india and not we          chapter xi       that evening  after dining alone  the doctor went in to bathurst s   the latter had already heard the news  and they talked it over for some  time  then the doctor said   have you seen forster  bathurst  since he  arrived       no  i was out when he left his card  i was at school with him   i heard  when i was in england that he was out here in the native cavalry  but i  have never run across him before  and i own i had no wish to do so  he  was about two years older than i was  and was considered the cock of the  school  he was one of my chief tormentors  i don t know that he was  a bully generally  fellows who are really plucky seldom are  but he  disliked me heartily  and i hated him      i had the habit of telling the truth when questioned  and he narrowly  escaped expulsion owing to my refusing to tell a lie about his being  quietly in bed when  in fact  he and two or three other fellows had been  out at a public house  he never forgave me for it  for he himself would  have told a lie without hesitation to screen himself  or  to do him  justice  to screen anyone else  and the mere fact that i myself had  been involved in the matter  having been sent out by one of the bigger  fellows  and  therefore  having got myself a flogging by my admission   was no mitigation in his eyes of my offense of what he called sneaking      so you may imagine i have no particular desire to meet him again   unless he has greatly changed  he would do me a bad turn if he had the  chance       i don t think he has greatly changed   the doctor said   that was  really what i came in here for this evening rather than to talk about  this sepoy business  i am sorry to say  bathurst  that when he was in  at the major s today your name happened to be mentioned  and he said  at once   is that the bathurst who they say showed the white feather at  chillianwalla and left the army in consequence       bathurst s face grew pale and his fingers closed  he remained silent a  minute  and then said   it does not matter  she would have been sure to  hear it sooner or later  and i should have told her myself if he had not  done so  besides  if  as i am afraid  this berhampore business is the  beginning of trouble  and of such trouble as we have never had since we  set foot in india  it is likely that everyone will know what she knows  now  has she spoken to you about it  i suppose she has  or you would not  have known that he mentioned it       yes  she was most indignant about it  and did not believe it       and what did you say  doctor   he asked indifferently      well  i was sorry i could not tell her exactly what you told me  it  would have been better if i could have done so  i simply said there were  many sorts of courage  and that i was sure that you possessed many sorts  in a very high degree  but i could not  of course  deny  although i did  not admit  the truth of the report he had mentioned       i don t think it makes much difference one way or the other   bathurst  said wearily   i have known all along that isobel hannay would not marry  a coward  only i have gone on living in a fool s paradise  however  it  is over now  the sooner it is all over the better       my dear fellow   the doctor said earnestly   don t take this thing too  much to heart  i don t wish to try and persuade you that it is not a  grave misfortune  but even suppose this trouble takes the very worst  form possible  i do not think you will come so very badly out of it as  you anticipate  even assuming that you are unable to do your part in  absolute fighting  there may be other opportunities  and most likely  will  in which you may be able to show that although unable to control  your nerves in the din of battle  you possess in other respects coolness  and courage  that feat of yours of attacking the tiger with the dog whip  shows conclusively that under many circumstances you are capable of most  daring deeds      bathurst sat looking down for some minutes   god grant that it may  be so   he said at last   but it is no use talking about it any more   doctor  i suppose major hannay will keep a sharp lookout over the men       yes  there was a meeting of the officers this afternoon  it was agreed  to make no outward change  and to give the troops no cause whatever to  believe that they are suspected  they all feel confident of the goodwill  of the men  at the same time they will watch them closely  and if the  news comes of further trouble  they will prepare the courthouse as a  place of refuge       that is a very good plan  but of course everything depends upon  whether  if the troops do rise in mutiny  the people of oude should join  them  they are a fighting race  and if they should throw in their lot  against us the position would be a desperate one       well  there is no doubt   the doctor said   that the rajah of bithoor  would be with us  that will make cawnpore safe  and will largely  influence all the great zemindars  though there is no doubt that a  good many of them have been sulky ever since the disarmament order was  issued  i believe there are few of them who have not got cannon hidden  away or buried  and as for the people  the number of arms given up was  as nothing to what we know they possessed  in other parts of india i  believe the bulk of the people will be with us  but here in oude  our  last annexation  i fear that they will side against us  unless all the  great landowners range themselves on our side       as far as i can see   bathurst said   the people are contented with the  change  i don t say what i may call the professional fighting class   the crowd of retainers kept by the great landowners  who were constantly  fighting against each other  annexation has put a stop to all that  and  the towns are crowded with these fighting men  who hate us bitterly  but  the peasants  the tillers of the soil  have benefited greatly  they  are no longer exposed to raids by their powerful neighbors  and  can cultivate their fields in peace and quiet  unfortunately their  friendship  such as it is  will not weigh in the slightest degree in  the event of a struggle  at any rate  i am sure they are not behind the  scenes  and know nothing whatever of any coming trouble  going as i  do among them  and talking to them as one of themselves  i should have  noticed it had there been any change in them  and of late naturally i  have paid special notice to their manner  well  if it is to come i hope  it will come soon  for anything is better than suspense      two days later major hannay read out to the men on parade an official  document  assuring them that there was no truth whatever in the  statements that had been made that the cartridges served out to them had  been greased with pigs  fat  they were precisely the same as those that  they had used for years  and the men were warned against listening to  seditious persons who might try to poison their minds and shake their  loyalty to the government  he then told them that he was sorry to say  that at one or two stations the men had been foolish enough to listen  to disloyal counsels  and that in consequence the regiments had been  disbanded and the men had forfeited all the advantages in the way of pay  and pension they had earned by many years of good conduct  he said that  he had no fear whatever of any such trouble arising with them  as they  knew that they had been well treated  that any legitimate complaint  they might make had always been attended to  and that their officers had  their welfare thoroughly at heart     when he had finished  the senior native officer stepped forward  and in  the name of the detachment assured the major that the men were perfectly  contented  and would in all cases follow their officers  even if they  ordered them to march against their countrymen  at the conclusion of his  speech he called upon the troops to give three cheers for the major and  officers  and this was responded to with a show of great enthusiasm     this demonstration was deemed very satisfactory  and the uneasiness  among the residents abated considerably  while the major and his  officers felt convinced that  whatever happened at other stations  there  would at least be no trouble at deennugghur      well  even you are satisfied  doctor  i suppose   the major said  as  a party of them who had been dining with dr  wade were smoking in the  veranda      i was hopeful before  major  and i am hopeful now  but i can t say that  today s parade has influenced me in the slightest  whatever virtues  the hindoo may have  he has certainly that of knowing how to wait  i  believe  from what took place  that they have no intention of breaking  out at present  whether they are waiting to see what is done at other  stations  or until they receive a signal  is more than i can say  but  their assurances do not weigh with me to the slightest extent  their  history is full of cases of perfidious massacre  i should say   trust  them as long as you can  but don t relax your watch        you are a confirmed croaker   captain rintoul said      i do not think so  rintoul  i know the men i am talking about  and i  know the hindoos generally  they are mere children  and can be molded  like clay  as long as we had the molding  all went well  but if  they fall into the hands of designing men they can be led in another  direction just as easily as we have led them in ours  i own that i don t  see who can be sufficiently interested in the matter to conceive and  carry out a great conspiracy of this kind  the king of oude is a captive  in our hands  the king of delhi is too old to play such a part  scindia  and holkar may possibly long for the powers their fathers possessed   but they are not likely to act together  and may be regarded as rivals  rather than friends  and yet if it is not one of these who has been  brewing this storm  i own i don t see who can be at the bottom of it   unless it has really originated from some ambitious spirits among  the sepoys  who look in the event of success to being masters of the  destinies of india  it is a pity we did not get a few more views from  that juggler  we might have known a little more of it then       don t talk about him  doctor   wilson said   it gives me the cold  shivers to think of that fellow and what he did  i have hardly slept  since then  it was the most creepy thing i ever saw  richards and i have  talked it over every evening we have been alone together  and we can t  make head or tail of the affair  richards thinks it wasn t the girl at  all who went up on that pole  but a sort of balloon in her shape  but  then  as i say  there was the girl standing among us before she took her  place on the pole  we saw her sit down and settle herself on the cushion  so that she was balanced right  so it could not have been a balloon  then  and if it were a balloon afterwards  when did she change  at any  rate the light below was sufficient to see well until she was forty or  fifty feet up  and after that she shone out  and we never lost sight of  her until she was ever so high  i can understand the pictures  because  there might have been a magic lantern somewhere  but that girl trick   and the basket trick  and that great snake are altogether beyond me       so i should imagine  wilson   the doctor said dryly   and if i were you  i would not bother my head about it   nobody has succeeded in finding  out any of them yet  and all the wondering in the world is not likely to  get you any nearer to it       that is what i feel  doctor  but it is very riling to see things that  you can t account for anyhow  i wish he had sent up richards on the pole  instead of the girl  i would not have minded going up myself if he had  asked me  though i expect i should have jumped off before it got up very  far  even at the risk of breaking my neck       i should not mind risking that   the doctor said   though i doubt  whether i should have known any more about it when i came down  but  these jugglers always bring a girl or a boy with them instead of calling  somebody out from the audience  as they do at home  well  if things are  quiet we will organize another hunt  wilson  i have heard of a tiger  fifteen miles away from where we killed our last  and you and richards  shall go with me if you like       i should like it of all things  doctor  provided it comes off by day   i don t think i care about sitting through another night on a tree  and  then not getting anything like a fair shot at the beast after all       we will go by day   the doctor said   bathurst has promised to get some  elephants from one of the zemindars  we will have a regular party this  time  i have half promised miss hannay she shall have a seat in a howdah  with me if the major will give her leave  and in that case we will send  out tents and make a regular party of it  what do you say  major       i am perfectly willing  doctor  and have certainly no objection to  trusting isobel to your care  i know you are not likely to miss       no  i am not likely to miss  certainly  and besides  there will be  wilson and richards to give him the coup de grace if i don t finish  him      there was a general laugh  for the two subalterns had been chaffed a  good deal at both missing the tiger on the previous occasion      well  when shall it be  major       not just at present  at any rate   the major said   we must see how  things are going on  i certainly should not think of going outside the  station now  nor could i give leave to any officer to do so  but if  things settle down  and we hear no more of this cartridge business for  the next ten days or a fortnight  we will see about it      but although no news of any outbreak similar to that at barrackpore  was received for some days  the report that came showed a widespread  restlessness  at various stations  all over india  fires  believed to be  the work of incendiaries  took place  and there was little abatement of  the uneasiness  it become known  too  that a native officer had before  the rising of berhampore given warning of the mutiny  and had stated  that there was a widespread plot throughout the native regiments to  rise  kill their officers  and then march to delhi  where they were all  to gather     the story was generally disbelieved  although the actual rising had  shown that  to some extent  the report was well founded  still men could  not bring themselves to believe that the troops among whom they had  lived so long  and who had fought so well for us  could meditate such  gross treachery  without having  as far as could be seen  any real cause  for complaint     the conduct of the troops at deennugghur was excellent  and the colonel  wrote that at cawnpore there were no signs whatever of disaffection  and  that the rajah of bithoor had offered to come down at the head of his  own troops should there be any symptoms of mutiny among the sepoys   altogether things looked better  and a feeling of confidence that there  would be no serious trouble spread through the station     the weather had set in very hot  and there was no stirring out now for  the ladies between eleven o clock and five or six in the afternoon   isobel  however  generally went in for a chat  the first thing after  early breakfast  with mrs  doolan  whose children were fractious with  prickly heat      i only wish we had some big  high mountain  my dear  somewhere within  reach  where we could establish the children through the summer and run  away ourselves occasionally to look after them  we are very badly off  here in oude for that  you are looking very pale yourself the last few  days       i suppose i feel it a little   isobel said   and of course this anxiety  everyone has been feeling worries one  everyone seems to agree that  there is no fear of trouble with the sepoys here  still  as nothing else  is talked about  one cannot help feeling nervous about it  however  as  things seem settling down now  i hope we shall soon get something else  to talk about       i have not seen mr  bathurst lately   mrs  doolan said presently      nor have we   isobel said quietly   it is quite ten days since we saw  him last       i suppose he is falling back into his hermit ways   mrs  doolan said  carelessly  shooting a keen glance at isobel  who was leaning over one  of the children      he quite emerged from his shell for a bit  mrs  hunter was saying she  never saw such a change in a man  but i suppose he has got tired of it   captain forster arrived just in time to fill up the gap  how do you like  him  isobel       he is amusing   the girl said quietly   i have never seen anyone quite  like him before  he talks in an easy  pleasant sort of way  and tells  most amusing stories  then  when he sits down by one he has the knack of  dropping his voice and talking in a confidential sort of way  even when  it is only about the weather  i am always asking myself how much of it  is real  and what there is under the surface      mrs  doolan nodded approval      i don t think there is much under the surface  dear  and what there is  is just as well left alone  but there is no doubt he can be delightful  when he chooses  and very few women would not feel flattered by the  attentions of a man who is said to be the handsomest officer in the  indian army  and who has besides distinguished himself several times as  a particularly dashing officer       i don t think handsomeness goes for much in a man   isobel said  shortly     mrs  doolan laughed      why should it not go for as much as prettiness in a woman  it is no use  being cynical  isobel  it is part of our nature to admire pretty things   and as far as i can see an exceptionally handsome man is as legitimate  an object of admiration as a lovely woman       yes  to admire  mrs  doolan  but not to like       well  my dear  i don t want to be hurrying you away  but i think you  had better get back before the sun gets any higher  you may say you  don t feel the heat much  but you are looking pale and fagged  and the  less you are out in the sun the better      isobel had indeed been having a hard time during those ten days  at  first she had thought of little but what she should do when bathurst  called  it seemed impossible that she could be exactly the same with him  as she had been before  that was quite out of the question  and yet how  was she to be different     ten days had passed without his coming  this was so unusual that an  idea came into her mind which terrified her  and the first time when the  doctor came in and found her alone she said   of course  dr  wade  you  have not mentioned to mr  bathurst the conversation we had  but it is  curious his not having been here since       certainly i mentioned it   the doctor said calmly   how could i do  otherwise  it was evident to me that he would not be welcomed here as he  was before  and i could not do otherwise than warn him of the change he  might expect to find  and to give him the reason for it      isobel stood the picture of dismay   i don t think you had any right  to do so  doctor   she said   you have placed me in a most painful  position       in not so painful a one as it would have been  my dear  if he had  noticed the change himself  as he must have done  and asked for the  cause of it      isobel stood twisting her fingers over each other before her nervously      but what am i to do   she asked      i do not see that there is anything more for you to do   the doctor  said   mr  bathurst may not be perfect in all respects  but he is  certainly too much of a gentleman to force his visits where they are  not wanted  i do not say he will not come here at all  for not to do so  after being here so much would create comment and talk in the station   which would be as painful to you as to him  but he certainly will not  come here more often than is necessary to keep up appearances       i don t think you ought to have told him   isobel repeated  much  distressed      i could not help it  my dear  you would force me to admit there was  some truth in the story captain forster told you  and i was  therefore   obliged to acquaint him with the fact or he would have had just cause  to reproach me  besides  you spoke of despising a man who was not  physically brave       you never told him that  doctor  surely you never told him that       i only told what it was necessary he should know  my dear  namely  that  you had heard the story  that you had questioned me  and that i  knowing  the facts from his lips  admitted that there was some foundation for the  story  while asserting that i was convinced that he was morally a brave  man  he did not ask how you took the news  nor did i volunteer any  information whatever on the subject  but he understood  i think   perfectly the light in which you would view a coward       but what am i to do when we meet  doctor   she asked piteously      i should say that you will meet just as ordinary acquaintances do meet   miss hannay  people are civil to others they are thrown with  however  much they may distrust them at heart  you may be sure that mr  bathurst  will make no allusion whatever to the matter  i think i can answer for  it that you will see no shade of difference in his manner  this has  always been a heavy burden for him  as even the most careless observer  may see in his manner  i do not say that this is not a large addition to  it  but i dare say he will pull through  and now i must be off       you are very unkind  doctor  and i never knew you unkind before       unkind   the doctor repeated  with an air of surprise   in what way   i love this young fellow  i had cherished hopes for him that he hardly  perhaps ventured to cherish for himself  i quite agree with you that  what has passed has annihilated those hopes  you despise a man who is  a coward  i am not surprised at that  bathurst is the last man in the  world who would force himself upon a woman who despised him  i have done  my best to save you from being obliged to make a personal declaration of  your sentiments  i repudiate altogether the accusation as being unkind   i don t blame you in the slightest  i think that your view is the one  that a young woman of spirit would naturally take  i acquiesce in it  entirely  i will go farther  i consider it a most fortunate occurrence  for you both that you found it out in time      isobel s cheeks had flushed and paled several times while he was  speaking  then she pressed her lips tightly together  and as he finished  she said   i think  doctor  it will be just as well not to discuss the  matter further       i am quite of your opinion   he said   we will agree not to allude to  it again  goodby      and then isobel had retired to her room and cried passionately  while  the doctor had gone off chuckling to himself as if he were perfectly  satisfied with the state of affairs     during the week that had since elapsed the major had wondered and  grumbled several times at bathurst s absence      i expect   he said one day  when a note of refusal had come from him    that he doesn t care about meeting forster  you remember forster said  they had been at school together  and from the tone in which he spoke  it is evident that they disliked each other there  no doubt he has heard  from the doctor that forster is frequently in here   and the major spoke  rather irritably  for it seemed to him that isobel showed more pleasure  in the captain s society than she should have done after what he had  said to her about him  indeed  isobel  especially when the doctor was  present  appeared by no means to object to captain forster s attentions     upon the evening  however  of the day when isobel had spoken to mrs   doolan  bathurst came in  rather late in the evening      how are you  bathurst   the major said cordially   why  you have become  quite a stranger  we haven t seen you for over a fortnight  do you know  captain forster       we were at school together formerly  i believe   bathurst said  quietly   we have not met since  and i fancy we are both changed beyond  recognition      captain forster looked with surprise at the strong  well knit figure  he  had not before seen bathurst  and had pictured him to himself as a weak   puny man      i certainly should not have known mr  bathurst   he said   i have  changed a great deal  no doubt  but he has certainly changed more      there was no attempt on the part of either to shake hands  as they moved  apart isobel came into the room     a quick flash of color spread over her face when  upon entering  she saw  bathurst talking to her uncle  then she advanced  shook hands with  him as usual  and said   it is quite a time since you were here  mr   bathurst  if everyone was as full of business as you are  we should get  on badly      then she moved on without waiting for a reply and sat down  and was soon  engaged in a lively conversation with  captain forster  whilst bathurst   a few minutes later  pleading that as he had been in the saddle all day  he must go and make up for lost time  took his leave     captain forster had noticed the flush on isobel s cheeks when she saw  bathurst  and had drawn his own conclusions      there has been a flirtation between them   he said to himself   but i  fancy i have put a spoke in his wheel  she gave him the cold shoulder  unmistakably      april passed  and as matters seemed to be quieting down  there being no  fresh trouble at any of the stations  the major told dr  wade that he  really saw no reason why the projected tiger hunt should not take place   the doctor at once took the matter in hand  and drove out the next  morning to the village from which he had received news about the tiger   had a long talk with the shikaris of the place  took a general view of  the country  settled the line in which the beat should take place   and arranged for a large body of beaters to be on the spot at the time  agreed on     bathurst undertook to obtain the elephants from two zemindars in the  neighborhood  who promised to furnish six  all of which were more or  less accustomed to the sport  while the major and mr  hunter  who had  been a keen sportsman  although he had of late given up the pursuit of  large game  arranged for a number of bullock carts for the transport of  tents and stores     bathurst himself declined to be one of the party  which was to consist  of mr  hunter and his eldest daughter  the major and isobel  the doctor   the two subalterns  and captain forster  captain doolan said frankly  that he was no shot  and more likely to hit one of the party than the  tiger  captain rintoul at first accepted  but his wife shed such floods  of tears at the idea of his leaving her and going into danger  that for  the sake of peace he agreed to remain at home     wilson and richards were greatly excited over the prospect  and talked  of nothing else  they were burning to wipe out the disgrace of having  missed on the previous occasion  each of them interviewed the doctor  privately  and implored him to put them in a position where they were  likely to have the first shot  both used the same arguments  namely   that the doctor had killed so many tigers that one more or less could  make no difference to him  and if they missed  which they modestly  admitted was possible  he could still bring the animal down     as the doctor was always in a good temper when there was a prospect of  sport  he promised each of them to do all that he could for them  at the  same time pointing out that it was always quite a lottery which way the  tiger might break out     isobel was less excited than she would have thought possible over the  prospect of taking part in a tiger hunt  she had many consultations  to hold with mrs  hunter  the doctor  and rumzan as to the food to be  taken  and the things that would be absolutely necessary for camping  out  for  as it was possible that the first day s beat would be  unsuccessful  they were to be prepared for at least two days  absence  from home  two tents were to be taken  one for the gentlemen  the other  for isobel and mary hunter  these  with bedding and camp furniture   cooking utensils and provisions  were to be sent off at daybreak  while  the party were to start as soon as the heat of the day was over      i wish bathurst had been coming   major hannay said  as  with isobel by  his side  he drove out of the cantonment   he seems to have slipped away  from us altogether  he has only been in once for the last three or four  weeks  you haven t had a tiff with him about anything  have you  isobel   it seems strange his ceasing so suddenly to come after our seeing so  much of him       no  uncle  i have not seen him except when you have  what put such an  idea into your mind       i don t know  my dear  young people do have tiffs sometimes about all  sorts of trifles  though i should not have thought that bathurst was  the sort of man to do anything of that sort  i don t think that he likes  forster  and does not care to meet him  i fancy that is at the bottom of  it       very likely   isobel said innocently  and changed the subject     it was dark when they reached the appointed spot  and indeed from the  point where they left the road a native with a torch had run ahead to  show them the way  the tents looked bright  two or three large fires  were burning round them  and the lamps had already been lighted within      these tents do look cozy   mary hunter said  as she and isobel entered  the one prepared for them   i do wish one always lived under canvas  during the hot weather       they look cool   isobel said   but i don t suppose they are really as  cool as the bungalows  but they do make them comfortable  here is the  bathroom all ready  and i am sure we want it after that dusty drive   will you have one first  or shall i  we must make haste  for rumzan said  dinner would be ready in half an hour  fortunately we shan t be expected  to do much in the way of dressing      the dinner was a cheerful meal  and everyone was in high spirits     the tiger had killed a cow the day before  and the villagers were  certain that he had retired to a deep nullah round which a careful watch  had been kept all day  probably he would steal out by night to make a  meal from the carcass of the cow  but it had been arranged that he was  to do this undisturbed  and that the hunt was to take place by daylight      it is wonderful how the servants manage everything   isobel said   the  table is just as well arranged as it is at home  people would hardly  believe in england  if they could see us sitting here  that we were only  out on a two days  picnic  they would be quite content there to rough  it and take their meals sitting on the ground  or anyway they could get  them  it really seems ridiculous having everything like this       there is nothing like making yourself comfortable   the doctor said    and as the servants have an easy time of it generally  it does them  good to bestir themselves now and then  the expense of one or two extra  bullock carts is nothing  and it makes all the difference in comfort       how far is the nullah from here  doctor   wilson  who could think of  nothing else but the tiger  asked      about two miles  it is just as well not to go any nearer  not that he  would be likely to pay us a visit  but he might take the alarm and shift  his quarters  no  no more wine  major  we shall want our blood cool in  the morning  now we will go out to look at the elephants and have a talk  with the mahouts  and find out which of the animals can be most trusted  to stand steady  it is astonishing what a dread most elephants have of  tigers  i was on one once that i was assured would face anything  and  the brute bolted and went through some trees  and i was swept off the  pad and was half an hour before i opened my eyes  it was a mercy i had  not every rib broken  fortunately i was a lightweight  or i might have  been killed  and i have seen the same sort of thing happen a dozen  times  so we must choose a couple of steady ones  anyhow  for the  ladies      for the next hour they strolled about outside  the doctor cross  questioned the mahouts and told off the elephants for the party  then  there was a talk with the native shikaris and arrangements made for the  beat  and at an early hour all retired to rest  the morning was just  breaking when they were called  twenty minutes later they assembled to  take a cup of coffee before starting  the elephants were arranged in  front of the tents  and they were just about to mount when a horse was  heard coming at a gallop      wait a moment   the major said   it may be a message of some sort from  the station   a minute later bathurst rode in and reined up his horse in  front of the tent      why  bathurst  what brings you here  changed your mind at the last  moment  and found you could get away  that s right  you shall come on  the pad with me       no  i have not come for that  major  i have brought a dispatch that  arrived at two o clock this morning  doolan opened it and came to me   and asked me to bring it on to you  as i knew the way and where your  camp was to be pitched       nothing serious  i hope  bathurst   the major said  struck with the  gravity with which bathurst spoke   it must be something important  or  doolan would never have routed you off like that       it is very serious  major   bathurst said  in a low voice   may i  suggest you had better go into the tent to read it  some of the servants  understand english       come in with me   the major said  and led the way into the tent  where  the lamps were still burning on the breakfast table  although the light  had broadened out over the sky outside  it was with grave anticipation  of evil that the major took the paper from its envelope  but his worst  fears were more than verified by the contents      my dear major  the general has just received a telegram with terrible  news from meerut   native troops mutinied  murdered officers  women  and  children  opened jails and burned cantonments  and marched to delhi   it  is reported that there has been a general rising there and the massacre  of all europeans  although this is not confirmed  the news is considered  probable  we hear also that the native cavalry at lucknow have mutinied   lawrence telegraphs that he has suppressed it with the european troops  there  and has disarmed the mutineers  i believe that our regiment  will be faithful  but none can be trusted now  i should recommend your  preparing some fortified house to which all europeans in station can  retreat in case of trouble  now that they have taken to massacre as well  as mutiny  god knows how it will all end       good heavens  who could have dreamt of this   the major groaned    massacred their officers  women  and children  all europeans at delhi  supposed to have been massacred  and there must be hundreds of them  can  it be true       the telegram as to meerut is clearly an official one   bathurst said    delhi is as yet but a rumor  but it is too probable that if these  mutineers and jail birds  flushed with success  reached delhi before the  whites were warned  they would have their own way in the place  as  with  the exception of a few artillerymen at the arsenal  there is not a white  soldier in the place       but there were white troops at meerut   the major said   what could  they have been doing  however  that is not the question now  we must   of course  return instantly  ask the others to come in here  bathurst   don t tell the girls what has taken place  it will be time enough for  that afterwards  all that is necessary to say is that you have brought  news of troubles at some stations unaffected before  and that i think it  best to return at once      the men were standing in a group  wondering what the news could be which  was deemed of such importance that bathurst should carry it out in the  middle of the night      the major will be glad if you will all go in  gentlemen   bathurst  said  as he joined them      are we to go in  mr  bathurst   miss hunter asked      no  i think not  miss hunter  the fact is there have been some troubles  at two or three other places  and the major is going to hold a sort  of council of war as to whether the hunt had not better be given up  i  rather fancy that they will decide to go back at once  news flies very  fast in india  i think the major would like that he and his officers  should be back before it is whispered among the sepoys that the  discontent has not  as we hoped  everywhere ceased       it must be very serious   isobel said   or uncle would never decide to  go back  when all the preparations are made       it would never do  you see  miss hannay  for the commandant and four of  the officers to be away  if the sepoys should take it into their heads  to refuse to receive cartridges or anything of that sort       you can t give us any particulars  then  mr  bathurst       the note was a very short one  and was partly made up of unconfirmed  rumors  as i only saw it in my capacity of a messenger  i don t think i  am at liberty to say more than that       what a trouble the sepoys are   mary hunter said pettishly   it is too  bad our losing a tiger hunt when we may never have another chance to see  one       that is a very minor trouble  mary       i don t think so   the girl said   just at present it seems to me to be  very serious      at this moment the doctor put his head out of the tent      will you come in  bathurst       we have settled  bathurst   the major said  when he entered   that we  must  of course  go back at once  the doctor  however  is of opinion  that if  after all the preparations were made  we were to put the tiger  hunt off altogether  it would set the natives talking  and the report  would go through the country like wildfire that some great disaster had  happened  we must go back at once  and mr  hunter  having a wife and  daughter there  is anxious to get back  too  but the doctor urges that  he should go out and kill this tiger  as it is known that you have just  arrived  he says that if you are willing to go with him  it will be  thought that you had come here to join the hunt  and if that comes off   and the tiger is killed  it does not matter whether two or sixty of us  went out       i shall be quite willing to do so   said bathurst   and i really think  that the doctor s advice is good  if  now that you have all arrived upon  the ground  the preparations were canceled  there can be no doubt that  the natives would come to the conclusion that something very serious had  taken place  and it would be all over the place in no time       thank you  bathurst  then we will consider that arranged  now we will  get the horses in as soon as possible  and be off at once      ten minutes later the buggies were brought round  and the whole party   with the exception of the doctor and bathurst  started for deennugghur         chapter xii        let us be off at once   dr  wade said to his companion   we can talk as  we go along  i have got two rifles with me  i can lend you one       i shall take no rifle   bathurst said decidedly   or rather i will take  one of the shikaris  guns for the sake of appearance  and for use i will  borrow one of their spears       very well  i will do the shooting  then   the doctor agreed     the two men then took their places on the elephants most used to the  work  and told the mahouts of the others to follow in case the elephants  should be required for driving the tiger out of the thick jungle  and  they then started side by side for the scene of action      this is awful news  bathurst  i could not have believed it possible  that these fellows who have eaten our salt for years  fought our  battles  and have seemed the most docile and obedient of soldiers   should have done this  that they should have been goaded into mutiny  by lies about their religion being in danger i could have imagined well  enough  but that they should go in for wholesale massacre  not only of  their officers  but of women and children  seems well nigh incredible   you and i have always agreed that if they were once roused there was  no saying what they would do  but i don t think either of us dreamt of  anything as bad as this       i don t know   bathurst said quietly   one has watched this cloud  gathering  and felt that if it did break it would be something terrible   no one can foresee now what it will be  the news that delhi is in the  hands of the mutineers  and that these have massacred all europeans  and  so placed themselves beyond all hope of pardon  will fly though india  like a flash of lightning  and there is no guessing how far the matter  will spread  there is no use disguising it from ourselves  doctor   before a week is over there may not be a white man left alive in  india  save the garrisons of strong places like agra  and perhaps the  presidential towns  where there is always a strong european force       i can t deny that it is possible  bathurst  if this revolt spreads  though the three presidencies the work of conquering india will have to  be begun again  and worse than that  for we should have opposed to us a  vast army drilled and armed by ourselves  and led by the native officers  we have trained  it seems stupefying that an empire won piecemeal  and  after as hard fighting as the world has ever seen  should be lost in a  week      the doctor spoke as if the question was a purely impersonal one      ugly  isn t it   he went on   and to think i have been doctoring up  these fellows for the last thirty years  saving their lives  sir  by  wholesale  if i had known what had been coming i would have dosed them  with arsenic with as little remorse as i should feel in shooting a  tiger s whelp  well  there is one satisfaction  the major has already  done something towards turning the courthouse into a fortress  and i  fancy a good many of the scoundrels will go down before they take it   that is  if they don t fall on us unawares  i have been a noncombatant  all my life  but if i can shoot a tiger on the spring i fancy i can hit  a sepoy  by jove  bathurst  that juggler s picture you told me of is  likely to come true after all       i wish to heaven it was   bathurst said gloomily   i could look without  dread at whatever is coming as far as i am concerned  if i could believe  it possible that i should be fighting as i saw myself there       pooh  nonsense  lad   the doctor said   knowing what i know of you  i  have no doubt that  though you may feel nervous at first  you will get  over it in time      bathurst shook his head   i know myself too well  doctor  to indulge in  any such hopes  now you see we are going out tiger hunting  at present   now  as far as i am concerned  i should feel much less nervous if i knew  i was going to enter the jungle on foot with only this spear  than i do  at the thought that you are going to fire that rifle a few paces from  me       you will scarcely notice it in the excitement   the doctor said   in  cold blood i admit you might feel it  but i don t think you will when  you see the tiger spring out from the jungle at us  but here we are   that is the nullah in which they say the tiger retires at night  i  expect the beaters are lying all round in readiness  and as soon as we  have taken up our station at its mouth they will begin      a shikari came up as they approached the spot      the tiger went out last night  sahib  and finished the cow  he came  back before daylight  and the beaters are all in readiness to begin      the elephants were soon in position at the mouth of the ravine  which  was some thirty yards across  at about the same distance in front of  them the jungle of high  coarse grass and thick bush began      if you were going to shoot  bathurst  we would take post one each side   but as you are not going to i will place myself nearly in the center   and if you are between me and the rocks the tiger is pretty certain to  go on the other side  as it will seem the most open to him  now we are  ready   he said to the shikari     the latter waved a white rag on the top of a long stick  and at the  signal a tremendous hubbub of gongs and tom toms  mingled with the  shouts of numbers of the men  arose  the doctor looked across at  his companion  his face was white and set  his muscles twitched  convulsively  he was looking straight in front of him  his teeth set  hard      an interesting case   the doctor muttered to himself   if it had been  anyone else than bathurst  i expect the tiger will be some little time  before it is down  bathurst   he said  in a quiet voice  three times  he repeated the observation  each time raising his voice higher  before  bathurst heard him      the sooner it comes the better   bathurst said  between his teeth   i  would rather face a hundred tigers than this infernal din      a quarter of an hour passed  and the doctor  rifle in hand  was watching  the bushes in front when he saw a slight movement among the leaves on  his right  the side on which bathurst was stationed      that s him  bathurst  he has headed back  he caught sight of either  your elephant or mine  he will make a bolt in another minute now unless  he turns back on the beaters      a minute later there was a gleam of tawny yellow among the long grass   and quick as thought the doctor fired  with a sharp snarl the tiger  leaped out  and with two short bounds sprang onto the head of the  elephant ridden by bathurst  the mahout gave a cry of pain  for the  talons of one of the forepaws were fixed in his leg  bathurst leaned  forward and thrust the spear he held deep into the animal s neck  at  the same moment the doctor fired again  and the tiger  shot through the  head  fell dead  while  with a start  bathurst lost his balance and fell  over the elephant s head onto the body of the tiger     it was fortunate indeed for him that the ball had passed through the  tiger s skull from ear to ear  and that life was extinct before it  touched the ground  bathurst sprang to his feet  shaken and bewildered   but otherwise unhurt      he is as dead as a door nail   the doctor shouted   and lucky for you  he was so  if he had had a kick left in him you would have been badly  torn       i should never have fallen off   bathurst said angrily   if you had not  fired  i could have finished him with the spear       you might or you might not  i could not wait to think about that  the  tiger had struck its claws into the mahout s leg  and would have had him  off the elephant in another moment  that is a first rate animal you were  riding on  or he would have turned and bolted  if he had done so you and  the mahout would have both been off to a certainty      by this time the shouts of some natives  who had taken their posts in  trees near at hand  told the beaters that the shots they had heard had  been successful  and with shouts of satisfaction they came rushing  down  the doctor at once dispatched one of them to bring up his trap and  bathurst s horse  and then examined the tiger     it was a very large one  and the skin was in good condition  which  showed that he had not taken to man eating long  the doctor bound up the  wound on the mahout s leg  and then superintended the skinning of the  animal while waiting for the arrival of the trap     when it came up he said   you might as well take a seat by my side   bathurst  the syce will sit behind and lead your horse      having distributed money among the beaters  the doctor took his place  in his trap  the tiger skin was rolled up and placed under the seat   bathurst mounted beside him  and they started      there  you see  doctor   bathurst  who had not opened his lips from the  time he had remonstrated with the doctor for firing  said   you see it  is of no use  i was not afraid of the tiger  for i knew that you were  not likely to miss  and that in any case it could not reach me on the  elephant  i can declare that i had not a shadow of fear of the beast   and yet  directly that row began  my nerves gave way altogether  it was  hideous  and yet  the moment the tiger charged  i felt perfectly cool  again  for the row ceased as you fired your first shot  i struck it full  in the chest  and was about to thrust the spear right down  and should   i believe  have killed it  if you had not fired again and startled me so  that i fell from the elephant       i saw that the shouting and noise unnerved you  bathurst  but i saw too  that you were perfectly cool and steady when you planted your spear  into him  if it had not got hold of the mahout s leg i should not have  fired       is there nothing to be done  doctor  you know now what it is likely we  shall have to face with the sepoys and what it will be with me if they  rise  is there nothing you can do for me      the doctor shook his head   i don t believe in dutch courage in any  case  bathurst  certainly not in yours  there is no saying what the  effect of spirits might be  i should not recommend them  lad  of course   i can understand your feelings  but i still believe that  even if you do  badly to begin with  you will pull round in the end  i have no doubt you  will get a chance to show that it is only nerve and not courage in which  you are deficient      bathurst was silent  and scarce another word was spoken during the drive  back to deennugghur     the place had its accustomed appearance when they drove up  the doctor   as he drew up before his bungalow  said   thank god  they have not begun  yet  i was half afraid we might have found they had taken advantage of  most of us being away  and have broken out before we got back       so was i   bathurst said   i have been thinking of nothing else since  we started       well  i will go to the major at once and see what arrangements have  been made  and whether there is any further news       i shall go off on my rounds   bathurst said   i had arranged yesterday  to be at nilpore this morning  and there will be time for me to get  there now  it is only eleven o clock yet  i shall go about my work as  usual until matters come to a head      the doctor found that the major was over at the tent which served as the  orderly office  and at once followed him there      nothing fresh  major       no  we found everything going on as usual  it has been decided to put  the courthouse as far as we can in a state of defense  i shall have the  spare ammunition quietly taken over there  with stores of provisions   the ladies have undertaken to sew up sacking and make gunny bags for  holding earth  and  of course  we shall get a store of water there   everything will be done quietly at present  and things will be sent in  there after dark by such servants as we can thoroughly rely upon  at the  first signs of trouble the residents will make straight for that point   of course we must be guided by circumstances  if the trouble begins in  the daytime  that is  if it does begin  for the native officers assure  us that we can trust implicitly in the loyalty of the men  there will  probably be time for everyone to gain the courthouse  if it is at night   and without warning  as it was at meerut  i can only say  doctor  may  god help us all  for i fear that few  if any  of us would get there  alive  certainly not enough to make any efficient defense       i do not see that there is anything else to do  major  i trust with  you that the men will prove faithful  if not  it is a black lookout  whichever way we take it       did you kill the tiger  doctor       yes  at least bathurst and i did it between us  i wounded him first  it  then sprang upon bathurst s elephant  and he speared it  and i finished  it with a shot through the head       speared it   the major repeated   why didn t he shoot it  what was he  doing with his spear       he was born  major  with a constitutional horror of firearms  inherited  from his mother  i will tell you about it some day  in fact  he cannot  stand noise of any sort  it has been a source of great trouble to the  young fellow  who in all other respects has more than a fair share of  courage  however  we will talk about that when we have more time on our  hands  there is no special duty you can give me at present       yes  there is  you are in some respects the most disengaged man in  the station  and can come and go without attracting any attention  i  propose  therefore  that you shall take charge of the arrangement of  matters in the courthouse  i think that it will be an advantage if you  move from your tent in there at once  there is plenty of room for us  all  no one can say at what time there may be trouble with the sepoys   and it would be a great advantage to have someone in the courthouse  who could take the lead if the women  with the servants and so on  come  flocking in while we were still absent on the parade ground  besides   with your rifle  you could drive any small party off who attempted to  seize it by surprise  if you were there we would call it the hospital   which would be an excuse for sending in stores  bedding  and so on      you might mention in the orderly room that it is getting so hot now  that you think it would be as well to have a room or two fitted up under  a roof  instead of having the sick in tents  in case there should be an  outbreak of cholera or anything of that sort this year  i will say that  i think the idea is a very good one  and that as the courthouse is  very little used  you had better establish yourself there  the native  officers who hear what we say will spread the news  i don t say it will  be believed  but at least it will serve as an explanation       yes  i think that that will be a very good plan  major  two of the men  who act as hospital orderlies i can certainly depend upon  and they will  help to receive the things sent in from the bungalows  and will hold  their tongues as to what is being done  i shall leave my tent standing   and use it occasionally as before  but will make the courthouse my  headquarters  how are we off for arms       there are five cases of muskets and a considerable stock of ammunition  in that small magazine in the lines  one of the first things will be to  get them removed to the courthouse  we have already arranged to do that  tonight  it will give us four or five muskets apiece       good  major  i will load them all myself and keep them locked up in  a room upstairs facing the gateway  and should there be any trouble i  fancy i could give a good account of any small body of men who might  attempt to make an entrance  i am very well content with my position as  commandant of the hospital  as we may call it  the house has not been  much good to us hitherto  but i suppose when it was bought it was  intended to make this a more important station  it is fortunate they did  buy it now  for we can certainly turn it into a small fortress  still   of course  i cannot disguise from myself that though we might get on  successfully for a time against your sepoys  there is no hope of holding  it long if the whole country rises       i quite see that  doctor   the major said gravely   but i have really  no fear of that  with the assistance of the rajah of bithoor  cawnpore  is safe  his example is almost certain to be followed by almost all the  other great landowners  no  it is quite bad enough that we have to face  a sepoy mutiny  i cannot believe that we are likely to have a general  rising on our hands  if we do    and he stopped      if we do it is all up with us  major  there is no disguising that   however  we need not look at the worst side of things  well  i will go  with you to the orderly room  and will talk with you about the hospital  scheme  mention that there is a rumor of cholera  and so on  and ask  if i can t have a part of the courthouse  then we can walk across there  together  and see what arrangement had best be made      the following day brought another dispatch from the colonel  saying that  the rumors as to delhi were confirmed  the regiments there had joined  the meerut mutineers  had shot down their officers  and murdered  every european they could lay hands on  that three officers and six  noncommissioned officers  who were in charge of the arsenal  had  defended it desperately  and had finally blown up the magazine with  hundreds of its assailants  three of the defenders had reached meerut  with the news     day by day the gloom thickened  the native regiments in the punjaub rose  as soon as the news from meerut and delhi reached them  but there were  white troops there  and they were used energetically and promptly  in  some places the mutineers were disarmed before they broke out into open  violence  in other cases mutinous regiments were promptly attacked and  scattered  several of the leading chiefs had hastened to assure the  government of their fidelity  and had placed their troops and resources  at its disposal     but in the punjaub alone the lookout appeared favorable  in the daob  a mutiny had taken place at four of the stations  and the sepoys had  marched away to delhi  but without injuring the europeans     after this for a week there was quiet  and then at places widely  apart  at hansid and hissar  to the northwest of delhi  at nusserabad   in the center of rajpootana  at bareilly  and other stations in  rohilcund  the sepoys rose  and in most places massacre was added  to mutiny  then three regiments of the gwalior contingent at neemuch  revolted  then two regiments broke out at jhansi  and the whole of  the europeans  after desperately defending themselves for four days   surrendered on promise of their lives  but were instantly murdered     but before the news of the jhansi massacre reached deennugghur they  heard of other risings nearer to them  on the   th of may the three  native regiments at lucknow rose  but were sharply repulsed by the      european troops under sir henry lawrence  at seetapoor the sepoys rose  on the  d of june and massacred all the europeans  on the  th the sepoys  at mohundee imitated the example of those at seetapoor  while on the   th two regiments rose at fyzabad  in the southeastern division of the  province  and massacred all the europeans     up to this time the news from cawnpore had still been good  the rajah of  bithoor had offered sir hugh wheeler a reinforcement of two guns and      men  and it was believed that  seeing this powerful and influential  chief had thrown his weight into the scale on the side of the british   the four regiments of native troops would remain quiet     sir hugh had but a handful of europeans with him  but had just received  a reinforcement of fifty men of the   d regiment from lucknow  and he  had formed an intrenchment within which the europeans of the station   and the fugitives who had come in from the districts around  could take  refuge     several communications passed between sir hugh wheeler and major hannay   the latter had been offered the choice of moving into cawnpore with his  wing of the regiment  or remaining at deennugghur  he had chosen the  latter alternative  pointing out that he still believed in the fidelity  of the troops with him  but that if they went to cawnpore they would  doubtless be carried away with other regiments  and would only swell the  force of mutineers there  he was assured  at any rate  they would not  rise unless their comrades at cawnpore did so  but that it was best to  manifest confidence in them  as not improbably  did they hear that they  were ordered back to cawnpore  they might take it as a slur on their  fidelity  and mutiny at once     the month had been one of intense anxiety  gradually stores of  provisions had been conveyed into the hospital  as it was now called   the well inside the yard had been put into working order  and the  residents had sent in stores of bedding and such portable valuables as  could be removed     in but few cases had the outbreaks taken place at night  the mutineers  almost always breaking out either upon being ordered to parade or upon  actually falling in  still  it was by no means certain when a crisis  might come  and the europeans all lay down to rest in their clothes   one person in each house remaining up all night on watch  so that at the  first alarm all might hurry to the shelter of the hospital     its position was a strong one  a lofty wall inclosing a courtyard and  garden surrounding it  this completely sheltered the lower floor from  fire  the windows of the upper floor were above the level of the wall   and commanded a view over the country  while round the flat terraced  roof ran a parapet some two feet high     during the day the ladies of the station generally gathered at mr   hunter s  which was the bungalow nearest to the hospital  here they  worked at the bags intended to hold earth  and kept up each other s  spirits as well as they could  although all looked pale and worn  from anxiety and watching  there were  after the first few days  no  manifestations of fear  occasionally a tear would drop over their work   especially in the case of two of the wives of civilians  whose children  were in england  but as a whole their conversation was cheerful  each  trying her best to keep up the spirits of the others  generally  as soon  as the meeting was complete  mrs  hunter read aloud one of the psalms  suited to their position and the prayers for those in danger  then the  work was got out and the needles applied briskly  even mrs  rintoul  showed a fortitude and courage that would not have been expected from  her      one never knows people   mrs  doolan said to isobel  as they walked  back from one of these meetings   as long as one only sees them under  ordinary circumstances  i have never had any patience with mrs  rintoul   with her constant complaining and imaginary ailments  now that there is  really something to complain about  she is positively one of the calmest  and most cheerful among us  it is curious  is it not  how our talk  always turns upon home  india is hardly ever mentioned  we might be a  party of intimate friends  sitting in some quiet country place  talking  of our girlhood  why  we have learnt more of each other and each other s  history in the last fortnight than we should have done if we had lived  here together for twenty years under ordinary circumstances  except as  to your little brother  i think you are the only one  isobel  who has  not talked much of home       i suppose it is because my home was not a very happy one   isobel said      i notice that all the talk is about happy scenes  nothing is ever said  about disagreeables  i suppose  my dear  it is just as i have heard   that starving people talk about the feasts they have eaten  so we talk  of the pleasant times we have had  it is the contrast that makes them  dearer  it is funny  too  if anything can be funny in these days  how  different we are in the evening  when we have the men with us  to what  we are when we are together alone in the day  another curious thing is  that our trouble seems to make us more like each other  of course we are  not more like  but we all somehow take the same tone  and seem to have  given up our own particular ways and fancies      now the men don t seem like that  mr  hunter  for example  whom i used  to think an even tempered and easygoing sort of man  has become fidgety  and querulous  the major is even more genial and kind than usual  the  doctor snaps and snarls at everyone and everything  anyone listening  to my husband would say that he was in the wildest spirits  rintoul is  quieter than usual  and the two lads have grown older and nicer  i don t  say they are less full of fun than they were  especially wilson  but  they are less boyish in their fun  and they are nice with everyone   instead of devoting themselves to two or three of us  you principally   perhaps richards is the most changed  he thinks less of his collars and  ties and the polish of his boots than he used to do  and one sees  that he has some ideas in his head besides those about horses  captain  forster is  perhaps  least changed  but of that you can judge better  than i can  for you see more of him  as to mr  bathurst  i can say  nothing  for we never see him now  i think he is the only man in the  station who goes about his work as usual  he starts away the first thing  in the morning  and comes back late in the evening  and i suppose spends  the night in writing reports  though what is the use of writing reports  at the present time i don t know  mr  hunter was saying last night it  was very foolish of him  what with disbanded soldiers  and what with  parties of mutineers  it is most dangerous for any european to stir  outside the station       uncle was saying the same   isobel said quietly      well  here we separate  of course you will be in as usual this  evening   for the major s house was the general rendezvous after dinner     isobel had her private troubles  although  as she often said angrily  to herself  when she thought of them  what did it matter now  she was  discontented with herself for having spoken as strongly as she did as  to the man s cowardice  she was very discontented with the doctor  for having repeated it  she was angry with bathurst for staying away  altogether  although willing to admit that  after he knew what she had  said  it was impossible that he should meet her as before  most of all   perhaps  she was angry because  at a time when their lives were all in  deadly peril  she should allow the matter to dwell in her mind a single  moment     late one afternoon bathurst walked into the major s bungalow just as he  was about to sit down to dinner      major  i want to speak to you for a moment   he said      sit down and have some dinner  bathurst  you have become altogether a  stranger       thank you  major  but i have a great deal to do  can you spare me five  minutes now  it is of importance      isobel rose to leave the room      there is no reason you should not hear  miss hannay  but it would be  better that none of the servants should be present  that is why i wish  to speak before your uncle goes in to dinner      isobel sat down with an air of indifference      for the last week  major  i have ridden every day five and twenty to  thirty miles in the direction of cawnpore  my official work has been  practically at an end since we heard the news from meerut  i could be of  no use here  and thought that i could do no better service than trying  to obtain the earliest news from cawnpore  i am sorry to say that this  afternoon i distinctly heard firing in that direction  what the result  is  of course  i do not know  but i feel that there is little doubt that  troubles have begun there  but this is not all  on my return home   ten minutes ago  i found this letter on my dressing table  it had no  direction and is  as you see  in hindustanee   and he handed it to the  major  who read      to the sahib bathurst   rising at cawnpore today  nana sahib and  his troops will join the sepoys  whites will be destroyed  rising at  deennugghur at daylight tomorrow  troops  after killing whites  will  join those at cawnpore  be warned in time  this tiger is not to be  beaten off with a whip       good heavens   the major exclaimed   can this be true  can it be  possible that the rajah of bithoor is going to join the mutineers  it is  impossible  he could never be such a scoundrel       what is it  uncle   isobel asked  leaving her seat and coming up to  him     the major translated the letter      it must be a hoax   he went on   i cannot believe it  what does this  stuff about beating a tiger with a whip mean       i am sorry to say  major hannay  that part of the letter convinces me  that the contents can be implicitly relied upon  the writer did not dare  sign his name  but those words are sufficient to show me  and were no  doubt intended to show me  who the warning comes from  it is from that  juggler who performed here some six weeks ago  traveling about as he  does  and putting aside altogether those strange powers of his  he  has no doubt the means of knowing what is going on  as i told you that  night  i had done him some slight service  and he promised at the time  that  if the occasion should ever arise  he would risk his life to save  mine  the fact that he showed  i have no doubt  especially to please me   feats that few europeans have seen before  is  to my mind  a proof of  his goodwill and that he meant what he said       but how do you know that it is from him  bathurst  you will excuse  my pressing the question  but of course everything depends on my being  assured that this communication is trustworthy       this allusion to the tiger shows me that  major  it alludes to an  incident that i believe to be known only to him and his daughter and to  dr  wade  to whom alone i mentioned it      as the major still looked inquiringly  bathurst went on reluctantly    it was a trifling affair  major  the result of a passing impulse  i was  riding home from narkeet  and while coming along the road through the  jungle  which was at that time almost deserted by the natives on account  of the ravages of the man eater whom the doctor afterwards shot  i heard  a scream  galloping forward  i came upon the brute  standing with  one paw upon a prostrate girl  while a man  the juggler  was standing  frantically waving his arms  on the impulse of the moment i sprang from  my horse and lashed the tiger across the head with that heavy dog whip i  carry  and the brute was so astonished that it bolted in the jungle      that was the beginning and end of affairs  except that  although  fortunately the girl was practically unhurt  she was so unnerved that  we had to carry her to the next village  where she lay for some time  ill from the shock and fright  after that they came round here and  performed  for my amusement  the feats i told you of  so you see i have  every reason to believe in the good faith of the writer of this letter       by jove  i should think you had   the major said   why  my dear  bathurst  i had no idea that you could do such a thing       we have all our strong points and our weak ones  major  that was one of  my strong ones  i suppose  and now what had best be done  sir  that is  the important question at present      this was so evident  that major hannay at once dismissed all other  thoughts from his mind      of course i and the other officers must remain at our posts until the  sepoys actually arrive  the question is as to the others  now that we  know the worst  or believe we know it  ought we to send the women and  children away       that is the question  sir  but where can they be sent  lucknow is  besieged  the whites at cawnpore must have been surrounded by this time   the bands of mutineers are ranging the whole country  and at the news  that nana sahib has joined the rebels it is probable that all will  rise  i should say that it was a matter in which mr  hunter and other  civilians had better be consulted       yes  we will hold a council   the major said      i think  major  it should be done quietly  it is probable that many of  the servants may know of the intentions of the sepoys  and if they see  that anything like a council of the europeans was being held they  may take the news to the sepoys  and the latter  thinking that their  intention is known  may rise at once       that is quite true  yes  we must do nothing to arouse suspicion  what  do you propose  mr  bathurst       i will go and have a talk with the doctor  he can go round to the other  officers one by one  i will tell mr  hunter  and he will tell the other  residents  so that when they meet here in the evening no explanations  will be needed  and a very few words as we sit out on the veranda will  be sufficient       that will be a very good plan  we will sit down to dinner as if nothing  had happened  if they are watching at all  they will be keeping their  eyes on us then       very well  i will be in by nine o clock  major   and with a slight bow  to isobel  bathurst stepped out through the open window  and made his  way to the doctor s         chapter xiii       the doctor had just sat down to dinner when bathurst came in  the two  subalterns were dining with him      that s good  bathurst   the doctor said  as he entered   boy  put a  chair for mr  bathurst  i had begun to think that you had deserted me as  well as everybody else       i was not thinking of dining   bathurst said  as he sat down   but i  will do so with pleasure  though i told my man i should be back in half  an hour   and as the servant left the room he added   i have much to  say  doctor  get through dinner as quickly as you can  and get the  servants out of the tent      the conversation was at once turned by the doctor upon shooting and  hunting  and no allusion was made to passing events until coffee was put  on the table and the servant retired  the talk  which had been lively  during dinner  then ceased      well  bathurst   the doctor asked   i suppose you have something  serious to tell me       very serious  doctor   and he repeated the news he had given the major      it could not be worse  bathurst   the doctor said quietly  after the  first shock of the news had passed   you know i never had any faith in  the sepoys since i saw how this madness was spreading from station  to station  this sort of thing is contagious  it becomes a sort of  epidemic  and in spite of the assurances of the men i felt sure they  would go  but this scoundrel of bithoor turning against us is more than  i bargained for  there is no disguising the fact that it means a general  rising through oude  and in that case god help the women and children   as for us  it all comes in the line of business  what does the major  say       the only question that seemed to him to be open was whether the women  and children could be got away       but there does not seem any possible place for them to go to  one or  two might travel down the country in disguise  but that is out of the  question for a large party  there is no refuge nearer than allahabad   with every man s hand against them  i see not the slightest chance of a  party making their way down       you or i might do it easily enough  doctor  but for women it seems to  me out of the question  still  that is a matter for each married man to  decide for himself  the prospect is dark enough anyway  but  as before   it seems to me that everything really depends upon the zemindars  if we  hold the courthouse it is possible the sepoys may be beaten off in their  first attack  and in their impatience to join the mutineers  who are  all apparently marching for delhi  they may go off without throwing away  their lives by attacking us  for they must see they will not be able  to take the place without cannon  but if the zemindars join them with  cannon  we may defend ourselves till the last  but there can be but one  end to it      the doctor nodded   that is the situation exactly  bathurst       i am glad we know the danger  and shall be able to face it openly    wilson said   for the last month richards and i have been keeping watch  alternately  and it has been beastly funky work sitting with one s  pistols on the table before one  listening  and knowing any moment there  might be a yell  and these brown devils come pouring in  now  at least   we are likely to have a fight for it  and to know that some of them will  go down before we do      richards cordially agreed with his companion      well  now  what are the orders  bathurst   said the doctor      there are no orders as yet  doctor  the major says you will go round  to the others  doolan  rintoul  and forster  and tell them  i am to go  round to hunter and the other civilians  then  this evening we are to  meet at nine o clock  as usual  at the major s  if the others decide  that the only plan is for all to stop here and fight it out  there will  be no occasion for anything like a council  it will only have to be  arranged at what time we all move into the fort  and the best means for  keeping the news from spreading to the sepoys  not that it will make  much difference after they have once fairly turned in  if there is one  thing a hindoo hates more than another  it is getting from under his  blankets when he has once got himself warm at night  even if they heard  at one or two o clock in the morning that we were moving into the fort i  don t think they would turn out till morning       no  i am sure they would not   the doctor agreed      if there were a few more of us   richards said   i should vote for our  beginning it  if we were to fall suddenly upon them we might kill a lot  and scare the rest off       we are too few for that   the doctor said   besides  although bathurst  answers for the good faith of the sender of the warning  there has as  yet been no act of mutiny that would justify our taking such a step as  that  it would come to the same thing  we might kill a good many  but in  the long run three hundred men would be more than a match for a dozen   and then the women would be at their mercy  well  we had better be  moving  or we shall not have time to go round to the bungalows before  the people set out for the major s      it was a painful mission that bathurst had to perform  for he had to  tell those he called upon that almost certain death was at hand  but  the news was everywhere received calmly  the strain had of late been so  great  that the news that the crisis was at hand was almost welcome  he  did not stay long anywhere  but  after setting the alternative before  them  left husband and wife to discuss whether to try to make down to  allahabad or to take refuge in the fort     soon after nine o clock all were at major hannay s  there were pale  faces among them  but no stranger would have supposed that the whole  party had just received news which was virtually a death warrant  the  ladies talked together as usual  while the men moved in and out of the  room  sometimes talking with the major  sometimes sitting down for a few  minutes in the veranda outside  or talking there in low tones together     the major moved about among them  and soon learned that all had  resolved to stay and meet together whatever came  preferring that to the  hardships and unknown dangers of flight      i am glad you have all decided so   he said quietly   in the state the  country is  the chances of getting to allahabad are next to nothing   here we may hold out till lawrence restores order at lucknow  and then  he may be able to send a party to bring us in  or the mutineers may draw  off and march to delhi  i certainly think the chances are best here   besides  every rifle we have is of importance  and though if any of  you had made up your minds to try and escape i should have made no  objection  i am glad that we shall all stand together here      the arrangements were then briefly made for the removal to the  courthouse  all were to go back and apparently to retire to bed as  usual  at twelve o clock the men  armed  were to call up their servants   load them up with such things as were most required  and proceed with  them  the women  and children  at once to the courthouse  half the men  were to remain there on guard  while the others would continue with  the servants to make journeys backwards and forwards to the bungalows   bringing in as much as could be carried  the guard to be changed every  hour  in the morning the servants were all to have the choice given them  of remaining with their masters or leaving     captain forster was the only dissentient  he was in favor of the whole  party mounting  placing the women and children in carriages  and making  off in a body  fighting their way if necessary down to allahabad  he  admitted that  in addition to the hundred troopers of his own squadron   they might be cut off by the mutinous cavalry from cawnpore  fall in  with bodies of rebels or be attacked by villagers  but he maintained  that there was at least some chance of cutting their way through  while   once shut up in the courthouse  escape would be well nigh impossible      but you all along agreed to our holding the courthouse  forster   the  major said      yes  but then i reckoned upon cawnpore holding out with the assistance  of nana sahib  and upon the country remaining quiet  now the whole thing  is changed  i am quite ready to fight in the open  and to take my chance  of being killed there  but i protest against being shut up like a rat in  a hole      to the rest  however  the proposal appeared desperate  there would be no  withstanding a single charge of the well trained troopers  especially as  it would be necessary to guard the vehicles  had it not been for that   the small body of men might possibly have cut their way through the  cavalry  but even then they would be so hotly pursued that the most of  them would assuredly be hunted down  but encumbered by the women such  an enterprise seemed utterly hopeless  and the whole of the others were  unanimously against it     the party broke up very early  the strain of maintaining their ordinary  demeanor was too great to be long endured  and the ladies with children  were anxious to return as soon as possible to them  lest at the last  moment the sepoys should have made some change in their arrangements  by  ten o clock the whole party had left     the two subalterns had no preparations to make  they had already sent  most of their things into the hospital  and  lighting their pipes  they  sat down and talked quietly till midnight  then  placing their pistols  in their belts and wrapping themselves in their cloaks  they went into  the doctor s tent  which was next to theirs     the doctor at once roused his servant  who was sleeping in a shelter  tent pitched by the side of his  the man came in looking surprised at  being called   roshun   the doctor said   you have been with me ten  years  and i believe you to be faithful       i would lay down my life for the sahib   the man said quietly      you have heard nothing of any trouble with the sepoys       no  sahib  they know that roshun is faithful to his master       we have news that they are going to rise in the morning and kill all  europeans  so we are going to move at once into the hospital       good  sahib  what will you take with you       my books and papers have all gone in   the doctor said   that  portmanteau may as well go  i will carry these two rifles myself  the  ammunition is all there except that bag in the corner  which i will  sling round my shoulder       what are in those two cases  doctor   wilson asked      brandy  lad       we may as well each carry one of those  doctor  if your boy takes the  portmanteau  it would be a pity to leave good liquor to be wasted by  those brutes       i agree with you  wilson  besides  the less liquor they get hold of  the better for us  now  if you are all ready  we will start  but we must  move quietly  or the sentry at the quarter guard may hear us      ten minutes later they reached the hospital  being the last of the party  to arrive there      now  major   the doctor said cheerily  as soon as he entered   as this  place is supposed to be under my special charge i will take command for  the present  wilson and richards will act as my lieutenants  we have  nothing to do outside  and can devote ourselves to getting things a  little straight here  the first thing to do is to light lamps in all the  lower rooms  then we can see what we are doing  and the ladies will be  able to give us their help  while the men go out with the servants to  bring things in  and remember the first thing to do is to bring in the  horses  they may be useful to us  there is a good store of forage piled  in the corner of the yard  but the syces had best bring in as much  more as they can carry  now  ladies  if you will all bring your bundles  inside the house we will set about arranging things  and at any rate get  the children into bed as quickly as possible      as it had been already settled as to the rooms to be occupied  the  ladies and their ayahs set to work at once  glad to have something to  employ them  one of the rooms which had been fitted up with beds had  been devoted to the purposes of a nursery  and the children  most of  whom were still asleep  were soon settled there  two other rooms had  been fitted up for the use of the ladies  while the men were occupying  two others  the courtroom being turned into a general meeting and dining  room     at first there was not much to do  but as the servants  closely watched  by their masters  went backwards and forwards bringing in goods of all  kinds  there was plenty of employment in carrying them down to a large  underground room  where they were left to be sorted later on     the doctor had appointed isobel hannay and the two miss hunters to the  work of lighting a fire and getting boiling water ready  and a plentiful  supply of coffee was presently made  wilson and richards drawing the  water  carrying the heavier loads downstairs  and making themselves  generally useful     captain forster had not come in  he had undertaken to remain in his tent  in the lines  where he had quietly saddled and unpicketed his horse   tying it up to the tent ropes so that he could mount in an instant  he  still believed that his own men would stand firm  and declared he would  at their head charge the mutinous infantry  while if they joined the  mutineers he would ride into the fort  it was also arranged that he  should bring in word should the sepoys obtain news of what was going on  and rise before morning     all felt better and more cheerful after having taken some coffee      it is difficult to believe  miss hannay   richards said   that this  is all real  and not a sort of picnic  or an early start on a hunting  expedition       it is indeed  mr  richards  i can hardly believe even now that it is  all true  and have pinched myself two or three times to make sure that i  am awake       if the villains venture to attack us   wilson said   i feel sure we  shall beat them off handsomely       i have no doubt we shall  mr  wilson  especially as it will be in  daylight  you know you and mr  richards are not famous for night  shooting      the young men both laughed      we shall never hear the last of that tiger story  miss hannay  i can  tell you it is no joke shooting when you have been sitting cramped up  on a tree for about six hours  we are really both pretty good shots   of course  i don t mean like the doctor  but we always make good scores  with the targets  come  richards  here is another lot of things  if they  go on at this rate the sepoys won t find much to loot in the bungalows  tomorrow      just as daylight was breaking the servants were all called together  and  given the choice of staying or leaving  only some eight or ten  all of  whom belonged to the neighborhood  chose to go off to their villages   the rest declared they would stay with their masters     two of the party by turns had been on watch all night on the terrace  to listen for any sound of tumult in the lines  but all had gone on  quietly  bathurst had been working with the others all night  and  after seeing that all his papers were carried to the courthouse  he  had troubled but little about his own belongings  but had assisted the  others in bringing in their goods     at daylight the major and his officers mounted and rode quietly down  towards the parade ground  bathurst and mr  hunter  with several of the  servants  took their places at the gates  in readiness to open and close  them quickly  while the doctor and the other europeans went up to the  roof  where they placed in readiness six muskets for each man  from the  store in the courthouse  isobel hannay and the wives of the two captains  were too anxious to remain below  and went up to the roof also  the  doctor took his place by them  examining the lines with a field glass     the officers halted when they reached the parade ground  and sat on  their horses in a group  waiting for the men to turn out as usual      there goes the assembly   the doctor said  as the notes of the bugle  came to their ears   the men are turning out of their tents  there  i  can make out forster  he has just mounted  a plucky fellow that      instead of straggling out onto the parade ground as usual  the sepoys  seemed to hang about their tents  the cavalry mounted and formed up in  their lines  suddenly a gun was fired  and as if at the signal the whole  of the infantry rushed forward towards the officers  yelling and  firing  and the latter at once turned their horses and rode towards the  courthouse      don t be alarmed  my dear   the doctor said to isobel   i don t suppose  anyone is hit  the sepoys are not good shots at the best of times  and  firing running they would not be able to hit a haystack at a hundred  yards  the cavalry stand firm  you see   he said  turning his glass in  that direction   forster is haranguing them  there  three of the native  officers are riding up to him  ah  one has fired at him  missed  ah   that is a better shot   as the man fell from his horse  from a shot from  his captain s pistol     the other two rushed at him  one he cut down  and the other shot  then  he could be seen again  shouting and waving his sword to the men  but  their yells could be heard as they rode forward at him      ride  man  ride   the doctor shouted  although his voice could not have  been heard at a quarter of the distance     but instead of turning forster rode right at them  there was a confused  melee for a moment  and then his figure appeared beyond the line   through which he had broken  with yells of fury the troopers reined in  their horses and tried to turn them  but before they could do so the  officer was upon them again  his revolver cracked in his left hand  and  his sword flashed in his right  two or three horses and men were seen to  roll over  and in a moment he was through them again and riding at full  speed for the courthouse  under a scattered fire from the infantry   while the horsemen  now in a confused mass  galloped behind him      now then   the doctor shouted  picking up his rifle   let them know  we are within range  but mind you don t hit forster  fire two or three  shots  and then run down to the gate  he is well mounted  and has a good  fifty yards  start of them      then taking deliberate aim he fired  the others followed his example   three of the troopers dropped from their horses  four times those on the  terrace fired  and then ran down  each  at the doctor s order  taking  two guns with him  one of these was placed in the hands of each of the  officers who had just ridden in  and they then gathered round the gate   in two minutes forster rode in at full speed  then fifteen muskets  flashed out  and several of the pursuers fell from their horses  a  minute later the gate was closed and barred  and the men all ran up to  the roof  from which three muskets were fired simultaneously      well done   the doctor exclaimed   that is a good beginning      a minute later a brisk fire was opened from the terrace upon the  cavalry  who at once turned and rode rapidly back to their lines     captain forster had not come scathless through the fray  his cheek had  been laid open by a sabre cut  and a musket ball had gone through the  fleshy part of his arm as he rode back      this comes of fighting when there is no occasion   the doctor growled   when he dressed his wounds   here you are charging a host like a paladin  of old  forgetful that we want every man who can lift an arm in defense  of this place       i think  doctor  there is someone else wants your services more than i  do       yes  is anyone else hit       no  i don t know that anyone else is hit  doctor  but as i turned to  come into the house after the gates were shut  there was that fellow  bathurst leaning against the wall as white as a sheet  and shaking all  over like a leaf  i should say a strong dose of dutch courage would be  the best medicine there       you do not do justice to bathurst  captain forster   the doctor said  gravely   he is a man i esteem most highly  in some respects he is the  bravest man i know  but he is constitutionally unable to stand  noise  and the sound of a gun is torture to him  it is an unfortunate  idiosyncrasy for which he is in no way accountable       exceedingly unfortunate  i should say   forster said  with a dry  laugh   especially at times like this  it is rather unlucky for him  that fighting is generally accompanied by noise  if i had such an  idiosyncrasy  as you call it  i would blow out my brains       perhaps bathurst would do so  too  captain forster  if he had not more  brains to blow out than some people have       that is sharp  doctor   forster laughed good temperedly   i don t mind  a fair hit       well  i must go   the doctor said  somewhat mollified   there is plenty  to do  and i expect  after these fellows have held a council of war   they will be trying an attack      when the doctor went out he found the whole of the garrison busy  the  major had placed four men on the roof  and had ordered everyone else to  fill the bags that had been prepared for the purpose with earth from  the garden  it was only an order to the men and male servants  but  the ladies had all gone out to render their assistance  as fast as the  natives filled the bags with earth the ladies sewed up the mouths of the  bags  and the men carried them away and piled them against the gate     the garrison consisted of the six military officers  the doctor  seven  civilians  ten ladies  eight children  thirty eight male servants  and  six females  the work  therefore  went on rapidly  and in the course  of two hours so large a pile of bags was built up against the gate that  there was no probability whatever of its being forced      now   the major said   we want four dozen bags at least for the  parapet of the terrace  we need not raise it all  but we must build up a  breastwork two bags high at each of the angles      there was only just time to accomplish this when one of the watch on the  roof reported that the sepoys were firing the bungalows  as soon as  they saw that the europeans had gained the shelter of the courthouse the  sepoys  with yells of triumph  had made for the houses of the europeans   and their disappointment at finding that not only had all the whites  taken refuge in the courthouse  but that they had removed most of  their property  vented itself in setting fire to the buildings  after  stripping them of everything  and then amused themselves by keeping up a  straggling fire against the courthouse     as soon as the bags were taken onto the roof  the defenders  keeping as  much as possible under the shelter of the parapet  carried them to  the corners of the terrace and piled them two deep  thus forming a  breastwork four feet high  eight of the best shots were then chosen  and  two of them took post at each corner      now   the doctor said cheerfully  as he sat behind a small loophole  that had been left between the bags   it is our turn  and i don t fancy  we shall waste as much lead as they have been doing      the fire from the defenders was slow  but it was deadly  and in a very  short time the sepoys no longer dared to show themselves in the open   but took refuge behind trees  whence they endeavored to reply to the  fire on the roof  but even this proved so dangerous that it was not long  before the fire ceased altogether  and they drew off under cover of the  smoke from the burning bungalows     isobel hannay had met bathurst as he was carrying a sack of earth to the  roof      i have been wanting to speak to you  mr  bathurst  ever since yesterday  evening  but you have never given me an opportunity  will you step into  the storeroom for a few minutes as you come down      as he came down he went to the door of the room in which isobel was  standing awaiting him      i am not coming in  miss hannay  i believe i know what you are going  to say  i saw it in your face last night when i had to tell that tiger  story  you want to say that you are sorry you said that you despised  cowards  do not say it  you were perfectly right  you cannot despise  me one tenth as much as i despise myself  while you were looking at the  mutineers from the roof i was leaning against the wall below well nigh  fainting  what do you think my feelings must be that here  where every  man is brave  where there are women and children to be defended  i alone  cannot bear my part  look at my face  i know there is not a vestige of  color in it  look at my hands  they are not steady yet  it is useless  for you to speak  you may pity me  but you cannot but despise me   believe me  that death when it comes will be to me a happy release  indeed from the shame and misery i feel      then  turning  he left the girl without another word  and went about  his work  the doctor had  just before going up to take his place on the  roof  come across him      come in here  my dear bathurst   he said  seizing his arm and dragging  him into the room which had been given up to him for his drugs and  surgical appliances      let me give you a strong dose of ammonia and ginger  you want a pickup  i can see by your face       i want it  doctor  but i will not take it   bathurst said   that is  one thing i have made up my mind to  i will take no spirits to create a  courage that i do not possess       it is not courage  it has nothing to do with courage   the doctor said  angrily   it is a simple question of nerves  as i have told you over and  over again       call it what you like  doctor  the result is precisely the same  i do  not mind taking a strong dose of quinine if you will give it me  for i  feel as weak as a child  but no spirits      with an impatient shrug of the shoulders the doctor mixed a strong dose  of quinine and gave it to him     an hour later a sudden outburst of musketry took place  not a native  showed himself on the side of the house facing the maidan  but from the  gardens on the other three sides a heavy fire was opened      every man to the roof   the major said   four men to each of the rear  corners  three to the others  do you think you are fit to fire  forster   had you not better keep quiet for today  you will have opportunities  enough       i am all right  major   he said carelessly   i can put my rifle through  a loophole and fire  though i have one arm in a sling  by jove   he  broke off suddenly   look at that fellow bathurst  he looks like a  ghost      the roll of musketry was unabated  and the defenders were already  beginning to answer it  the bullets sung thickly overhead  and above the  din could be heard the shouts of the natives  bathurst s face was rigid  and ghastly pale  the major hurried to him      my dear bathurst   he said   i think you had better go below  you will  find plenty of work to do there       my work is here   bathurst said  as if speaking to himself   it must be  done      the major could not at the moment pay further attention to him  for a  roar of fire broke out round the inclosure  as from the ruined bungalows  and from every bush the sepoys  who had crept up  now commenced the  attack in earnest  while the defenders lying behind their parapet  replied slowly and steadily  aiming at the puffs of smoke as they darted  out  his attention was suddenly called by a shout from the doctor      are you mad  bathurst  lie down  man  you a throwing away your life      turning round  the major saw bathurst standing up  right by the parapet   facing the point where the enemy fire was hottest  he held a rifle in  his hand but did not attempt to fire  his figure swayed slightly to and  fro      lie down   the major shouted   lie down  sir   and then as bathurst  still stood unmoved he was about to run forward  when the doctor from  one side and captain forster from the other rushed towards him through a  storm of bullets  seized him in their arms  and dragged him back to the  center of the terrace      nobly done  gentlemen   the major said  as they laid bathurst down   it  was almost miraculous your not being hit      bathurst had struggled fiercely for a moment  and then his resistance  had suddenly ceased  and he had been dragged back like a wooden figure   his eyes were closed now      has he been hit  doctor   the major asked   it seems impossible he  can have escaped  what madness possessed him to put himself there as a  target       no  i don t think he is hit   the doctor said  as he examined him   i  think he has fainted  we had better carry him down to my room  shake  hands  forster  i know you and bathurst were not good friends  and you  risked your life to save him       i did not think who it was   forster said  with a careless laugh   i  saw a man behaving like a madman  and naturally went to pull him down   however  i shall think better of him in future  though i doubt whether  he was in his right senses       he wanted to be killed   the doctor said quietly   and the effort that  he made to place himself in the way of death must have been greater than  either you or i can well understand  forster  i know the circumstances  of the case  morally i believe there is no braver man living than he is   physically he has the constitution of a timid woman  it is mind against  body       the distinction is too fine for me  doctor   forster said  as he  turned to go off to his post by the parapet   i understand pluck and i  understand cowardice  but this mysterious mixture you speak of is beyond  me altogether      the major and dr  wade lifted bathurst and carried him below  mrs   hunter  who had been appointed chief nurse  met them      is he badly wounded  doctor       no  he is not wounded at all  mrs  hunter  he stood up at the edge of  the parapet and exposed himself so rashly to the sepoys  fire that  we had to drag him away  and then the reaction  acting on a nervous  temperament  was too much for him  and he fainted  we shall soon bring  him round  you can come in with me  but keep the others away      the major at once returned to the terrace     in spite of the restoratives the doctor poured through his lips  and  cold water dashed in his face  bathurst was some time before he opened  his eyes  seeing mrs  hunter and the doctor beside him  he made an  effort to rise      you must lie still  bathurst   the doctor said  pressing his hand on  his shoulder   you have done a very foolish thing  a very wrong thing   you have tried to throw away your life       no  i did not  i had no thought of throwing away my life   bathurst  said  after a pause   i was trying to make myself stand fire  i did  not think whether i should be hit or not  i am not afraid of bullets   doctor  it s the horrible  fiendish noise that i cannot stand       i know  my boy   the doctor said kindly   but it comes to the same  thing  you did put yourself in the way of bullets when your doing so was  of no possible advantage  and it is almost a miracle that you escaped  unhurt  you must remain here quiet for the present  ii shall leave you  in charge of mrs  hunter  there is nothing for you to do on the roof  at present  this attack is a mere outbreak of rage on the part of the  sepoys that we have all escaped them  they know well enough they can t  take this house by merely firing away at the roof  when they attack in  earnest it will be quite time for you to take part in the affair again   now  mrs  hunter  my orders are absolute that he is not to be allowed to  get up      on the doctor leaving the room he found several of the ladies outside   the news that mr  bathurst had been carried down had spread among them      is he badly hurt  doctor       no  ladies  mr  bathurst is  unfortunately for himself  an extremely  nervous man  and the noise of firearms has an effect upon him that he  cannot by any effort of his own overcome  in order  as he says  to try  and accustom himself to it  he went and stood at the edge of the parapet  in full sight of the sepoys  and let them blaze away at him  he must  have been killed if forster and i had not dragged him away by main  force  then came the natural reaction  and he fainted  that is all there  is about it  poor fellow  he is extremely sensitive on the ground of  personal courage  in other respects i have known him do things requiring  an amount of pluck that not one man in a hundred possesses  and i wish  you all to remember that his nervousness at the effect of the noise of  firearms is a purely constitutional weakness  for which he is in no way  to be blamed  he has just risked his life in the most reckless manner in  order to overcome what he considers  and what he knows that some persons  consider  is cowardice  and it would be as cruel  and i may say as  contemptible  to despise him for a constitutional failing as it would be  to despise a person for being born a humpback or a cripple  but i cannot  stand talking any longer  i shall be of more use on the roof than i am  here      isobel hannay was not among those who had gathered near the door of the  room in which bathurst was lying  but the doctor had raised his voice   and she heard what he said  and bent over her work of sewing strips of  linen together for bandages with a paler face than had been caused by  the outbreak of musketry  gradually the firing ceased  the sepoys had  suffered heavily from the steady fire of the invisible defenders and  gradually drew off  and in an hour from the commencement of the attack  all was silent round the building      so far so good  ladies   the major said cheerily  as the garrison   leaving one man on watch  descended from the roof   we have had no  casualties  and i think we must have inflicted a good many  and the  mutineers are not likely to try that game on again  for they must see  that they are wasting ammunition  and are doing us no harm  now i hope  the servants have got tiffin ready for us  for i am sure we have all  excellent appetites       tiffin is quite ready  major   mrs  doolan  who had been appointed  chief of the commissariat department  said cheerfully   the servants  were a little disorganized when the firing began  but they soon became  accustomed to it  and i think you will find everything in order in the  hall      the meal was really a cheerful one  the fact that the first attack had  passed over without anyone being hit raised the spirits of the women   and all were disposed to look at matters in a cheerful light  the two  young subalterns were in high spirits  and the party were more lively  than they had been since the first outbreak of the mutiny  all had felt  severely the strain of waiting  and the reality of danger was a positive  relief after the continuous suspense  it was much to them to know that  the crisis had come at last  that they were still all together and the  foe were without      it is difficult to believe   mrs  doolan said   that it was only  yesterday evening we were all gathered at the major s  it seems an age  since then       yes  indeed   mrs  rintoul agreed   the night seemed endless  the worst  time was the waiting till we were to begin to move over  after that i  did not so much mind  though it seemed more like a week than a night  while the things were being brought in here       i think the worse time was while we were waiting watching from the roof  to see whether the troops would come out on parade as usual   isobel  said   when my uncle and the others were all in  and captain forster   and the gates were shut  it seemed that our anxieties were over       that was a mad charge of yours  forster   the major said   it was like  the balaclava business  magnificent  but it wasn t war       i did not think of it one way or the other   captain forster laughed    i was so furious at the insolence off those dogs attacking me  that  i thought of nothing else  and just went at them  but of course it was  foolish       it did good   the doctor said   it showed the sepoys how little we  thought of them  and how a single white officer was ready to match  himself against a squadron  it will render them a good deal more careful  in their attack than they otherwise would have been  it brought them  under our fire  too  and they suffered pretty heavily  and i am sure the  infantry must have lost a good many men from our fire just now  i hope  they will come to the conclusion that the wisest thing they can do is  to march away to delhi and leave us severely alone  now what are your  orders  major  for after breakfast       i think the best thing is for everyone to lie down for a few hours    the major said   no one had a wink of sleep last night  and most of us  have not slept much for some nights past  we must always keep two men on  the roof  to be relieved every two hours  i will draw up a regular rota  for duty  but except those two  the rest had better take a good sleep   we may be all called upon to be under arms at night       i will go on the first relief  major   the doctor said   i feel  particularly wide awake  it is nothing new to me to be up all night  put  bathurst down with me   he said  in a low tone  as the major rose from  the table   he knows that i understand him  and it will be less painful  for him to be with me than with anyone else  i will go up at once  and  send young harper down to his breakfast  there will be no occasion to  have bathurst up this time  the sepoys are not likely to be trying any  pranks at present  no doubt they have gone back to their lines to get a  meal      the doctor had not been long at his post when isobel hannay came up  onto the terrace  they had seen each other alone comparatively little of  late  as the doctor had given up his habit of dropping in for a chat in  the morning since their conversation about bathurst      well  my dear  what is it   he asked   this is no place for you  for  there are a few fellows still lurking among the trees  and they send a  shot over the house occasionally       i came up to say that i am sorry  doctor       that is right  isobel  always say you are sorry when you are so   although in nine cases out of ten  and this is one of them  the saying  so is too late to do much good       i think you are rather hard upon me  doctor  i know you were speaking  at me today when you were talking to the others  especially in what you  said at the end       perhaps i was  but i think you quite deserved it       yes  i know i did  but it was hard to tell me it was as contemptible to  despise a man for a physical weakness he could not help  as to despise  one for being born humpbacked or a cripple  when you know that my  brother was so       i wanted you to feel that your conduct had been contemptible  isobel   and i put it in the way that was most likely to come home to you  i have  been disappointed in you  i thought you were more sensible than the run  of young women  and i found out that you were not  i thought you had  some confidence in my judgment  but it turned out that you had not   if bathurst had been killed when he was standing up  a target for the  sepoys  i should have held you morally responsible for his death       you would have shared the responsibility  anyhow  doctor  for it was  you who repeated my words to him       we will not go over that ground again   said the doctor quietly   i  gave you my reasons for doing so  and those reasons are to my mind  convincing  now i will tell you how this constitutional nervousness on  his part arose  he told me the story  but as at that time there had  been no occasion for him to show whether he was brave or otherwise  i  considered my lips sealed  now that his weakness has been exhibited  i  consider myself more than justified in explaining its origin      and he then repeated the story bathurst had told him      you see   he said  when he had finished   it is a constitutional matter  beyond his control  it is a sort of antipathy  i have known a case of a  woman courageous in all other respects  who  at the sight of even a  dead cockroach  would faint away  i have seen one of the most gallant  officers of my acquaintance turn pale at the sight of a spider   certainly no one would think of calling either one or the other coward   and assuredly such a name should not be applied to a man who would face  a tiger armed only with a whip in defense of a native woman  because his  nerves go all to pieces at the sound of firearms       if you had told me all this before i should never have spoken as i  did   isobel pleaded      i did not go into the full details  but i told you that he was not  responsible for his want of firmness under fire  and that i knew him  in other respects to be a brave man   the doctor said uncompromisingly    since then you have by your manner driven him away from you  you have  flirted  well  you may not call it flirting   he broke off in answer  to a gesture of denial   but it was the same thing  with a man who is  undoubtedly a gallant soldier  a very paladin  if you like  but who   in spite of his handsome face and pleasant manner  is no more to be  compared with bathurst in point of moral qualities or mental ability  than light to dark  and this after i had like an old fool gone out of my  way to warn you  you have disappointed me altogether  isobel hannay      isobel stood motionless before him  with downcast eyes      well  there  my dear   the doctor went on hurriedly  as he saw a tear  glisten in her eyelashes   don t let us say anything more about it  in  the first place  it is no affair of mine  and in the second place  your  point of view was that most women would take at a time like this  only   you know  i expected you would not have done just as other women would   we cannot afford to quarrel now  for there is no doubt that  although we  may put a good face on the matter  our position is one of grave peril   and it is of no use troubling over trifles  now run away  and get a few  hours  sleep if you can  you will want all your strength before we are  through with this business      while the doctor had been talking to isobel  the men had gathered below  in a sort of informal council  the subject being bathurst s conduct on  the roof      i would not have believed it if i had not seen it   captain rintoul  said   the man was absolutely helpless with fright  i never saw such an  exhibition  and then his fainting afterwards and having to be carried  away was disgusting  in fact  it is worse than that      there was a general murmur of assent      it is disgraceful   one of the civilians said   i am ashamed that the  man should belong to our service  the idea of a fellow being helpless by  fright when there are women and children to be defended  it is downright  revolting       well  he did go and stick himself up in front   wilson said   you  should remember that  he may have been in a blue funk  i don t say he  wasn t  still  you know  he didn t go away and try to hide himself  but  he stuck himself up in front for them to fire at  i think we ought to  take that into consideration       dr  wade says bathurst put himself there to try and accustom himself to  fire   captain forster said   mind  i don t pretend to like the man  we  were at school together  and he was a coward then and a sneak  but for  all that one should look at it fairly  the doctor asserts that bathurst  is morally brave  but that somehow or other his nerves are too much  for him  i don t pretend to understand it myself  but there is no  doubt about the doctor s pluck  and i don t think he would stand up  for bathurst as he does unless he really thought he was not altogether  accountable for showing the white feather  i think  too  from what he  let drop  that the major is to some extent of the same opinion  what do  you think  doolan       i like bathurst   captain doolan said   i have always thought him a  first rate fellow  but one can t stick up  you know  for a fellow who  can t behave as a gentleman ought to  especially when there are women  and children in danger       it  is quite impossible that we should associate with him   captain  rintoul said   i don t propose that we should tell him what we think of  him  but i think we ought to leave him severely alone       i should say that he ought to be sent to coventry   richards said      i should not put it in that way   mr  hunter said gravely   i have  always esteemed bathurst  i look upon it as a terribly sad case  but  i agree with captain rintoul that  in the position in which we are now  placed  a man who proves himself to be a coward must be made to feel  that he stands apart from us  i should not call it sending him to  coventry  or anything of that sort  but i do think that we should  express by our manner that we don t wish to have any communication with  him      there was a general expression of assent to this opinion  wilson alone  protesting against it      you can do as you like   he said   but certainly i shall speak to  bathurst  and i am sure the doctor and major hannay will do so  i don t  want to stand up for a coward  but i believe what the doctor says  i  have seen a good deal of bathurst  and i like him  besides  haven t you  heard the story the doctor has been telling about his attacking a tiger  with a whip to save a native woman  i don t care what anyone says  a  fellow who is a downright coward couldn t do a thing like that       who told the doctor about it   farquharson asked   if he got it from  bathurst  i don t think it goes for much after what we have seen      wilson would have replied angrily  but captain doolan put his hand on  his shoulder      shut up  wilson   he said   this is no time for disputes  we are all in  one boat here  and must row together like brothers  you go your own  way about bathurst  i don t blame you for it  he is a man everyone has  liked  a first rate official  and a good fellow all round  except he is  not one of the sociable kind  at any other time one would not think so  much of this  but at present for a man to lack courage is for him to  lack everything  i hope he will come better out of it than it looks at  present  he will have plenty of chances here  and no one will be more  glad than i shall to see him pull himself together      the doctor  however  would have quarreled with everyone all round when  he heard what had been decided upon  had not major hannay taken him  aside and talked to him strongly      it will never do  doctor  to have quarrels here  and as commandant i  must beg of you not to make this a personal matter  i am very sorry for  this poor fellow  i accept entirely your view of the matter  but at  the same time i really can t blame the others for looking at it from a  matter of fact point of view  want of courage is at all times regarded  by men as the most unpardonable of failings  and at a time like the  present this feeling is naturally far stronger even than usual  i hope  with you that bathurst will retrieve himself yet  but we shall certainly  do him no good by trying to fight his battle until he does  you and  i  thinking as we do  will of course make no alteration in our manner  towards him  i am glad to hear that young wilson also stands as his  friend  let matters go on quietly  i believe they will come right in the  end      the doctor was obliged to acknowledge that the major s counsel was wise   and to refrain from either argument or sarcasm  but the effort required  to check his natural tendency to wordy conflict was almost too great for  him  and when not engaged in his own special duties he spent hours in  one of the angles of the terrace keenly watching every tree and bush  within range  and firing vengefully whenever he caught sight of a  lurking native  so accurate was his aim that the sepoys soon learned  to know and dread the crack of his rifle  and whenever it spoke out the  ground within its range was speedily clear of foes     the matter  however  caused a deep if temporary estrangement between  wilson and richards  although constantly chaffing each other  and  engaged in verbal strife  they had hitherto been firm friends  their  rivalry in the matter of horseflesh had not aroused angry feelings  even  their mutual adoration of isobel hannay had not affected a breach in  their friendship  but upon the subject of sending bathurst to  coventry they quarreled so hotly  that for a time they broke off all  communication with each other  and both in their hearts regretted that  their schoolboy days had passed  and that they could not settle the  matter in good schoolboy fashion         chapter xiv       but though obliged to defer to major hannay s wishes  and to abstain  from arguing with the men the question of bathurst being given the cold  shoulder  dr  wade had already organized the ladies in his favor  during  the afternoon he had told them the tiger story  and had confidentially  informed them how it was that bathurst from his birth had been  the victim of something like nervous paralysis at all loud sounds   especially those of the discharge of firearms      his conduct today   he said   and his courage in rescuing that native  girl from the tiger  illustrate his character  he is cool  brave  and  determined  as might be expected from a man of so well balanced a mind  as his  and even when his nerves utterly broke down under the din of  musketry  his will was so far dominant that he forced himself to  go forward and stand there under fire  an act which was  under the  circumstances  simply heroic      there is little difficulty in persuading women as to the merits of a man  they like  and bathurst had  since the troubles began  been much more  appreciated than before by the ladies of deennugghur  they had felt  there was something strengthening and cheering in his presence  for  while not attempting to minimize the danger  there was a calm confidence  in his manner that comforted and reassured those he talked to     in the last twenty four hours  too  he had unobtrusively performed many  little kindnesses  had aided in the removals  carried the children   looked after the servants  and had been foremost in the arrangement of  everything that could add to the comfort of the ladies      i am glad you have told us all about it  doctor   mrs  doolan said    and  of course  no one would dream of blaming him  i had heard that  story about his leaving the army years ago  but although i had only seen  him once or twice  i did not believe it for a minute  what you tell us  now  doctor  explains the whole matter  i pity him sincerely  it must be  something awful for a man at a time like this not to be able to take his  part in the defense  especially when there are us women here  why  it  would pain me less to see jim brought in dead  than for him to show the  white feather  what can we do for the poor fellow       treat him just as usual  there is nothing else you can do  mrs  doolan   any tone of sympathy  still less of pity  would be the worst thing  possible  he is in the lowest depths at present  but if he finds by your  tone and manner that you regard him on the same footing as before  he  will gradually come round  and i hope that before the end of the siege  he will have opportunities of retrieving himself  not under fire  that  is hopeless  but in other ways       you may be sure we will do all we can  doctor   mrs  doolan said  warmly   and there are plenty of ways he will be able to make himself  most useful  there is somebody wanted to look after all those syces and  servants  and it would be a comfort to us to have someone to talk to  occasionally  besides  all the children are fond of him      this sentiment was warmly echoed  and thus  when the determination  at which the men had arrived to cut bathurst became known  there was  something like a feminine revolution      you may do as you like   mrs  doolan said indignantly   but if you  think that we are going to do anything so cruel and unjust  you are  entirely mistaken  i can tell you      mrs  rintoul was equally emphatic  and mrs  hunter quietly  but with  as much decision  protested   i have always regarded mr  bathurst as a  friend   she said   and i shall continue to do so  it is very sad for  him that he cannot take part in the defense  but it is no more fair  to blame him than it would be to blame us  because we  too  are  noncombatants      isobel hannay had taken no part in the first discussion among the  ladies  nor did she say anything now      it is cruel and unjust   she said to herself   but they only think as  i did  i was more cruel and unjust than they  for there was no talk  of danger then  i expressed my contempt of him because there was a  suspicion that he had showed cowardice ten years ago  while they have  seen it shown now when there is fearful peril  if they are cruel and  unjust  what was i      later on the men gathered together at one end of the room  and talked  over the situation      dr  wade   the major said quietly   i shall be obliged if you will go  and ask mr  bathurst to join us  he knows the people round here better  than any of us  and his opinion will be valuable      the doctor  who had several times been in to see bathurst  went to his  room      the major wants you to join us  bathurst  we are having a talk over  things  and he wishes to have your opinion  i had better tell you that  as to yourself the camp is divided into two parties  on one side are the  major  wilson  and myself  and all the ladies  who take  i need not say   a common sense view of the matter  and recognize that you have done all  a man could do to overcome your constitutional nervousness  and that  there is no discredit whatever attached to you personally  the rest of  the men  i am sorry to say  at present take another view of the case   and are disposed to show you the cold shoulder       that  of course   bathurst said quietly   as to the ladies  view of it   i know that it is only the result of your good offices  doctor       then you will come   the doctor said  pleased that bathurst seemed less  depressed than he had expected      certainly i will come  doctor   bathurst said  rising   the worst  is over now  everyone knows that i am a coward  that is what i have  dreaded  there is nothing else for me to be afraid of  and it is of no  use hiding myself       we look quite at home here  mr  bathurst  don t we   mrs  doolan said  cheerfully  as he passed her   and i think we all feel a great deal more  comfortable than we did when you gave us your warning last night  the  anticipation is always worse than the reality       not always  i think  mrs  doolan   he said quietly   but you have  certainly made yourselves wonderfully at home  though your sewing is of  a more practical kind than that upon which you are ordinarily engaged      then he passed on with the doctor to the other end of the room  the  major nodded as he came up      all right again now  bathurst  i hope  we want your opinion  for you  know  i think  more of the zemindars in this part of the country than  any of us  of course  the question is  will they take part against us       i am afraid they will  major  i had hoped otherwise  but if it be  true that the nana has gone  and as the other part of the message was  correct  i have no doubt this is so also  i am afraid they will be  carried away with the stream       and you think they have guns       i have not the least doubt of it  the number given up was a mere  fraction of those they were said to have possessed       i had hoped the troops would have marched away after the lesson we gave  them this morning  but  so far as we can make out  there is no sign of  movement in their lines  however  they may start at daybreak tomorrow       i will go out to see if you like  major   bathurst said quietly   i  can get native clothes from the servants  and i speak the language well  enough to pass as a native  so if you give me permission i will go out  to the lines and learn what their intentions are       it would be a very dangerous undertaking   the major said gravely      i have no fear whatever of danger of that kind  major  my nerves are  steady enough  except when there is a noise of firearms  and then  as  you all saw this morning  i cannot control them  do what i will  risks  of any other kind i am quite prepared to undertake  but in this matter  i think the danger is very slight  the only difficulty being to get  through the line of sentries they have no doubt posted round the house   once past them  i think there is practically no risk whatever of their  recognizing me when made up as a native  the doctor has  no doubt  got  some iodine in his surgery  and a coat of that will bring me to the  right color       well  if you are ready to undertake it  i will not refuse   the major  said   how would you propose to get out       i noticed yesterday that the branches of one of the trees in the garden  extended beyond the top of the wall  i will climb up that and lower  myself on the other side by a rope  that is a very simple matter  the  spot is close to the edge of mr  hunter s compound  and i shall work my  way through the shrubbery till i feel sure i am beyond any sentries  who may be posted there  the chances are that they will not be thick  anywhere  except opposite the gate  by the way  captain forster  before  i go i must thank you for having risked your life to save mine this  morning  i heard from mrs  hunter that it was you and the doctor who  rushed forward and drew me back       it is not worth talking about   captain forster said carelessly   you  seemed bent on making a target of yourself  and as the major s orders  were that everyone was to lie down  there was nothing for it but to  remove you      bathurst turned to dr  wade   will you superintend my get up  doctor       certainly   the doctor said  with alacrity   i will guarantee that   with the aid of my boy  i will turn you out so that no one would know  you even in broad daylight  to say nothing of the dark      a quarter of an hour sufficed to metamorphose bathurst into an oude  peasant  he did not return to the room  but  accompanied by the doctor   made his way to the tree he had spoken of      by the way  you have taken no arms   the doctor said suddenly      they would be useless  doctor  if i am recognized i shall be killed  if  i am not discovered  and the chances are very slight of my being so  i  shall get back safely  by the way  we will tie some knots on that rope  before i let myself down  i used to be able to climb a rope without  them  but i doubt whether i could do so now       well  god bless you  lad  and bring you back safely  you may make as  light of it as you will  but it is a dangerous expedition  however  i  am glad you have undertaken it  come what may  for it has given you the  opportunity of showing you are not afraid of danger when it takes any  other form than that of firearms  there are plenty of men who would  stand up bravely enough in a fight  who would not like to undertake  this task of going out alone in the dark into the middle of these  bloodthirsty scoundrels  how long do you think you will be       a couple of hours at the outside       well  at the end of an hour i shall be back here again  don t be longer  than you can help  lad  for i shall be very anxious until you return      when the doctor re entered the house there was a chorus of questions      has mr  bathurst started       why did you not bring him in here before he left  we should all have  liked to have said goodby to him       yes  he has gone  i have seen him over the wall  and it was much better  that he should go without any fuss  he went off just as quietly and  unconcernedly as if he had been going out for an ordinary evening s  walk  now i am going up onto the roof  i don t say we should hear any  hubbub down at the lines if he were discovered there  but we should  certainly hear a shout if he came across any of the sentries round the  house       has he taken any arms  doctor   the major asked      none whatever  major  i asked him if he would not take pistols  but he  refused       well  i don t understand that   captain forster remarked   if i had  gone on such a business i would have taken a couple of revolvers  i am  quite ready to take my chance of being killed fighting  but i should not  like to be seized and hacked to pieces in cold blood  my theory is a man  should sell his life as dearly as he can       that is the animal instinct  forster   the doctor said sharply   though  i don t say that i should not feel the same myself  but i question  whether bathurst s is not a higher type of courage       well  i don t aspire to bathurst s type of courage  doctor   forster  said  with a short laugh     but the doctor did not answer  he had already turned away  and was  making for the stairs      may i go with you  doctor   isobel hannay said  following him   it is  very hot down here       yes  come along  child  but there is no time to lose  for bathurst  must be near where they are likely to have posted their sentries by this  time       everything quiet  wilson   he asked the young subaltern  who  with  another  was on guard on the roof      yes  we have heard nothing except a few distant shouts and noises out  at the lines  round here there has been nothing moving  except that we  heard someone go out into the garden just now       i went out with bathurst   the doctor said   he has gone in the  disguise of a native to the sepoy lines  to find out what are their  intentions       i heard the talk over it  doctor  i only came up on watch a few minutes  since  i thought it was most likely him when i heard the steps       i hope he is beyond the sentries   the doctor said   i have come up  here to listen       i expect he is through them before this   wilson said confidently   i  wish i could have gone with him  but of course it would not have been  any good  it is a beautiful night  isn t it  miss hannay   and there is  scarcely any dew falling       now  you go off to your post in the corner  wilson  your instructions  are to listen for the slightest sound  and to assure us against the  sepoys creeping up to the walls  we did not come up here to distract you  from your duties  or to gossip       there are richards and another posted somewhere in the garden   wilson  said   still  i suppose you are right  doctor  but if you  miss hannay   have come up to listen  come and sit in my corner  it is the one nearest  to the lines       you may as well go and sit down  isobel   the doctor said   that is   if you intend to stay up here long   and they went across with wilson to  his post      shall i put one of these sandbags for you to sit on       i would rather stand  thank you   and they stood for some time silently  watching the fires in the lines      they are drawing pretty heavily on the wood stores   the doctor  growled   there is a good deal more than the regulation allowance  blazing in those fires  i can make out a lot of figures moving about  round them  no doubt numbers of the peasants have come in       do you think mr  bathurst has got beyond the line of sentries   isobel  said  after standing perfectly quiet for some time      oh  yes  a long way  probably he was through by the time we came up  here  they are not likely to post them more than fifty or sixty yards  from the wall  and  indeed  it is  as bathurst pointed out to me   probable that they are only thick near the gate  all they want to do is  to prevent us slipping away  i should think that bathurst must be out  near the lines by this time      isobel moved a few paces away from the others  and again stood  listening      i suppose you do not think that there is any chance of an attack  tonight  doctor   wilson asked  in low tones      not in the least  the natives are not fond of night work  i expect they  are dividing the spoil and quarreling over it  anyhow  they have had  enough of it for today  they may intend to march away in the morning  or  they may have sent to cawnpore to ask for orders  or they may have heard  from some of the zemindars that they are coming in to join them  that is  what bathurst has gone out to learn  but anyhow i do not think they will  attack us again with their present force       i wish there were a few more of us   wilson said   so that we could  venture on a sortie       so do i  lad  but it is no use thinking about it as it is  we have to  wait  our fate is not in our own hands       and you think matters look bad  doctor       i think they could hardly look worse  unless the mutineers take it into  their heads to march away  there is  humanly speaking  but one chance  for us  and that is that lawrence may thrash the sepoys so completely  at lucknow that he may be able to send out a force to bring us in  the  chances of that are next to nothing  for in addition to a very large  sepoy force he has the population of lucknow  one of the most turbulent  in india  on his hands  ah  what is that      two musket shots in quick succession from the sepoy lines broke the  silence of the evening  and a startled exclamation burst from the girl  standing near them     the doctor went over to her      do you think  do you think   she said in a low  strained voice   that  it was bathurst       not at all  if they detected him  and i really do not see that there is  a chance of their doing so  disguised as he was  they would have seized  him and probably killed him  but there would be no firing  he has gone  unarmed  you know  and would offer no resistance  those shots you heard  were doubtless the result of some drunken quarrel over the loot       do you really think so  doctor       i feel quite sure of it  if it had been forster who had gone out  and  he had been detected  it would have been natural enough that we should  hear the sound of something like a battle  in the first place  he would  have defended himself desperately  and  in the next  he might have made  his way through them and escaped  but  as i said  with bathurst there  would be no occasion for their firing       why didn t he come in to say goodby before he went  that is what i  wanted to ask you  doctor  and why i came up here  i wanted to have  spoken to him  if only for a moment  before he started  i tried to catch  his eye as he went out of the room with you  but he did not even look at  me  it will be so hard if he never comes back  to know that he went away  without my having spoken to him again  i did try this morning to tell  him that i was sorry for what i said  but he would not listen to me       you will have an opportunity of telling him when he comes back  if you  want to  or of showing him so by your manner  which would be  perhaps   less painful to both of you       i don t care about pain to myself   the girl said   i have been unjust   and deserve it       i don t think he considers you unjust  i did  and told you so  he feels  what he considers the disgrace so much that it seems to him perfectly  natural he should be despised       yes  but i want him to see that he is not despised   she said quickly    you don t understand  doctor       i do understand perfectly  my dear  at least  i think  i think i do  i  see that you want to put yourself straight with him  which is very right  and proper  especially placed as we all are  but i would not do or say  anything hastily  you have spoken hastily once  you see  and made a mess  of it  i should be careful how i did it again  unless  of course   and  he stopped      unless what  doctor   isobel asked shyly  after a long pause  but there  was no reply  and looking round she saw that her companion had moved  quietly away and had joined wilson at his post  she stood for a  few minutes in the same attitude  and then moved quietly across the  staircase in the center of the terrace  and went down to the party  below  a short time later the doctor followed her  and  taking his  rifle  went out into the garden with captain doolan  who assisted him in  climbing the tree  and handed his gun up to him  the doctor made his  way out on the branch to the spot where it extended beyond the wall  and  there sat  straining his eyes into the darkness  half an hour passed   and then he heard a light footfall on the sandy soil      is that you  bathurst   he whispered      all right  doctor   and a minute later bathurst sat on the branch  beside him      well  what s your news       very bad  doctor  they expect the rajah por sing  who  it seems  is the  leader of the party in this district  and several other zemindars  to be  here with guns tomorrow or next day  the news from cawnpore was true    the native troops mutinied and marched away  but were joined by nana  sahib and his force  and he persuaded them to return and attack the  whites in their intrenchments at cawnpore  as they would not be well  received at delhi unless they had properly accomplished their share of  the work of rooting out the feringhees       the infernal scoundrel   the doctor exclaimed   after pretending for  years to be our best friend  i m disgusted to think that i have drunk  his champagne a dozen times  however  that makes little difference to us  now  your other news is the most important  we could have resisted  the sepoys for a month  but if they bring up guns there can be but one  ending to it       that is so  doctor  the only hope i can see is that they may find our  resistance so obstinate as to be glad to grant us terms of surrender       yes  there is that chance   the doctor agreed   but history shows there  is but little reliance to be placed upon native oaths      bathurst was silent  his own experience of the natives had taught him  the same lesson      it is a poor hope   he said  after a while   but it is the only one  so  far as i can see      not another word was spoken as they descended the tree and walked across  to the house      never mind about changing your things  come straight in       our scout has returned   the doctor said  as he entered the room  there  was a general exclamation of gladness on the part of the ladies who had  not retired      i am very glad to see you safe back  mr  bathurst   mrs  hunter said   going up to him and taking his hand   we have all been very anxious  since you left       the danger was very slight  mrs  hunter  i only wish i had brought you  back the news that the native lines were deserted and the mutineers in  full march for delhi and lucknow       i was afraid you would hardly bring that news  mr  bathurst  it was  almost too good to hope for  however  we are all glad that you are back   are we not  isobel       we are indeed  mr  bathurst  though as yet i can hardly persuade myself  that it is you in that get up       i think there is no doubt of my identity  can you tell me where you  uncle is  miss hannay  i have to make my report to him       he is on the roof  there is a sort of general gathering of our  defenders there      two lamps had been placed in the center of the terrace  and round these  the little garrison were grouped  some sitting on boxes  others lying on  mats  almost all smoking  bathurst was greeted heartily by the major and  wilson as soon as he was recognized      i am awfully glad to see you back   wilson said  shaking him warmly by  the hand   i wish i could have gone with you  two together does not seem  so bad  but i should not like to start out by myself as you did      there was a hearty cordiality in the young fellow s voice that was very  pleasant to bathurst      we have all our gifts  as hawkeye used to say  as i have no doubt you  remember  wilson  such gifts as i have lay in the way of solitary work   i fancy       now  light a cheroot  bathurst   the major said   and drink off this  tumbler of brandy and soda  and then let us hear your story       the story is simple enough  major  i got through without difficulty   the sentries are some distance apart round the garden wall  as soon as i  discovered by the sound of their footsteps where they were  it was easy  enough to get through them  then i made a longish detour  and came down  on the lines from the other side  there was no occasion for concealment  then  numbers of the country people had come in  and were gathered round  the sepoys  fires  and i was able to move about amongst them  and listen  to the conversation without the smallest hindrance      the sepoys were loudly expressing their dissatisfaction at their  officers leading them against the house today  when they had no means  of either battering down the walls or scaling them  then there was a  general opinion that treachery was at work  for how else should the  europeans have known they were going to rise that morning  and so moved  during the night into the house  there was much angry recrimination  and quarreling  and many expressed their regret they had not marched  straight to cawnpore after burning the bungalows      all this was satisfactory  but i learned that por sing and several  other zemindars had already sent in assurances that they were wholly  with them  and would be here  with guns to batter down the walls  some  time tomorrow       that is bad news  indeed   the major said gravely  when he had  finished   of course  when we heard that nana sahib had thrown in his  lot with the mutineers  it was probable that many of the landowners  would go the same way  but if the sepoys had marched off they might not  have attacked us on their own account  now we know that the sepoys are  going to stay  and that they will have guns  it alters our position  altogether      there was a murmur of assent      i should tell you before you talk the matter over further   bathurst  went on   that during the last hour some hundreds of peasants have taken  up their posts round the house in addition to the sepoy sentries  i came  back with one party about a hundred strong  they are posted a couple of  hundred yards or so in front of the gate  i slipped away from them in  the dark and made my way here       well  gentlemen  what do you think we had better do   the major said    we are all in the same boat  and i should like to have your opinions   we may defend this house successfully for days  possibly we may even  tire them out  but on the other hand they may prove too strong for  us  if the wall were breached we could hardly hope to defend it  and   indeed  if they constructed plenty of ladders they could scale it at  night in a score of places  we must  therefore  regard the house as our  citadel  close up the lower windows and doors with sandbags  and defend  it to the last  still  if they are determined  the lookout is not a very  bright one       i am in favor of our cutting our way out  major   captain forster  said   if we are cooped up here  we must  as you say  in the long run be  beaten       that would be all very well  captain forster  if we were all men    mr  hunter said   there are sixteen of us and there are in all eighteen  horses  for i and farquharson have two each  but there are eight women  and fourteen children  so all the horses would have to carry double  we  certainly could not hope to escape from them with our horses so laden   and if they came up with us  what fighting could we do with women behind  our saddles  moreover  we certainly could not leave the servants  who  have been true to us  to the mercy of the sepoys       besides  where could we go   the doctor asked   the garrison at  cawnpore  we know  are besieged by overwhelming numbers  we do not know  much as to the position at lucknow  but certainly the europeans are  immensely outnumbered there  and i think we may assume that they  are also besieged  it is a very long distance either to agra or to  allahabad  and with the whole country up in arms against us  and the  cavalry here at our heels  the prospect seems absolutely hopeless  what  do you think  doolan  you and rintoul have your wives here  and you have  children  i consider that the question concerns you married men more  than us       it is a case of the frying pan and the fire  as far as i can see   doctor  at any rate  here we have got walls to light behind  and food  for weeks  and plenty of ammunition  i am for selling our lives as  dearly as we can here rather than go outside to be chased like jackals       i agree with you  doolan   captain rintoul said   here we may be able  to make terms with them  but once outside the walls we should be at the  scoundrels  mercy  if it were not for the women and children i should  agree entirely with forster that our best plan would be to throw open  our gates and make a dash for it  keeping together as long as we could   and then  if necessary  separating and trying to make our way down to  agra or allahabad as best we could  but with ladies that does not seem  to be possible      the opinion of the married civilians was entirely in accord with that of  mr  hunter      but what hope is there of defending this place in the long run    captain forster said   if i saw any chance at all i should be quite  willing to wait  but i would infinitely rather sally out at once and  go for them and be killed than wait here day after day and perhaps week  after week  seeing one s fate drawing nearer inch by inch  what do you  say  bathurst  we haven t had your opinion yet       i do not think that the defense is so hopeless as you suppose  although  i admit that the chances are greatly against us   bathurst said quietly    i think there is a hope of tiring the natives out  the sepoys know well  enough there can be no great amount of loot here  while they think that  were they at cawnpore  at lucknow  or still more at delhi  their chances  of plunder would be much greater  moreover  i think that men in their  position  having offended  as it were  without hope of pardon  would  naturally desire to flock together  there is comfort and encouragement  in numbers  therefore  i am sure they will very speedily become  impatient if they do not meet with success  and would be inclined to  grant terms rather than waste time here      it is the same thing with the native gentry  they will want to be off  to lucknow or delhi  where they will know more how things are going   and where  no doubt  they reckon upon obtaining posts of importance and  increased possessions under the new order of things  therefore  i think   they  as well as the sepoys  are likely  if they find the task longer  and more difficult than they expect  to be ready to grant terms  i have  no great faith in native oaths  still they might be kept      captain forster s proposal i regard as altogether impracticable  we are  something like two hundred and fifty miles from the nearest british post  where we could hope to find refuge  and with the horses carrying double   the troopers at our heels directly we start  and the country hostile   i see no chance whatever  not a vestige of one  of our getting safely  away      but there is a third alternative by which some might escape  it is   that we should make our way out on foot  break up into parties of twos  and threes  steal or fight our way through the sentries  and then for  each party to shift for itself  making its way as best it can  traveling  by night and lying up in woods or plantations by day  getting food at  times from friendly natives  and subsisting  for the most part  upon  what might be gathered in the fields  in that way some might escape   but the suffering and hardships of the women and children would be  terrible       i agree with you   mr  hunter said   such a journey would be frightful  to contemplate  and i don t think  in our case  that my wife could  possibly perform such a journey  still  some might do so  at any rate  i  think the chances are better than they would be were we to ride out in  a body  i should suggest  major  when the crisis seems to be  approaching  that is  when it is clear that we can t defend ourselves  much longer  it would be fair that each should be at liberty to try to  get out and make down the country       certainly   the major agreed   we are in a position of men on board a  sinking ship with the boats gone  we should try to the end to save the  ship  but when all hope of doing that is over  each may try to get to  shore as he best can  as long as the house can be defended  all must  remain and bear their share in the struggle  but when we decide that it  is but a question of hours  all who choose will be at liberty to try to  escape       it will be vastly more difficult then than now   captain forster said    bathurst made his way out tonight without difficulty  but they will  be a great deal more vigilant when they know we cannot hold out much  longer  i don t see how it would be possible for women and children to  get through them       we might then adopt your scheme  to a certain extent  forster   major  hannay said   we could mount  sally out suddenly  break through their  pickets  and as soon as we are beyond them scatter  those who like can  try to make their way down on horseback  those who prefer it try to do  so on foot  that would at least give us an alternative should the siege  be pushed on to the last  and we find ourselves unable to make terms      there was general assent to the major s proposal  which seemed to offer  better chances than any  there was the hope that the mutineers might  tire of the siege and march away  that if they pressed it  terms might  be at last obtained from them  and that  failing everything else  the  garrison might yet make their way down country      as there is evidently no chance of an attack during the night   the  major said   we will divide into two watches and relieve each other  every four hours  that will give two as lookouts on the roof and six  in the inclosure  as you are senior officer next to myself  doolan  you  will take charge of one watch  i shall myself take charge of the other   forster and wilson be with me  rintoul and richards with you  mr  hardy   will you and the other gentlemen divide your numbers into two watches   dr  wade counts as a combatant until his hospital begins to fill       i fancy he may be counted as a combatant all through   the doctor  muttered      tomorrow morning   the major went on   we will continue the work of  filling sandbags  there are still a large number of empty bags on hand   we shall want them for all the lower windows and doors  and the  more there are of them the better  and we must also keep a supply in  readiness to make a retrenchment if they should breach the wall  now   mr  hunter  as soon as you have made out your list my watch can go on  duty  and i should advise the others to turn in without delay      when the ladies were informed that half the men were going on watch   mrs  doolan said   i have an amendment to propose  major  women s ears  are just as keen as men s  and i propose that we supply the sentries on  the roof  i will volunteer for one      the whole of the ladies at once volunteered      there is no occasion for so many   mrs  doolan said   and i propose  that tonight  at any rate  i should take the first watch with one of the  miss hunters  and that miss hannay and the other should take the  second  that will leave all the gentlemen available for the watch in the  inclosure      the proposal was agreed to  and in a short time the first watch had  taken their station  and the rest of the garrison lay down to rest     the night passed off quietly  the first work at which the major set the  garrison in the morning was to form six wooden stages against the wall   one by the gate  one against the wall at the other end  and two at each  of the long sides of the inclosure  they were twelve feet in height   which enabled those upon them to stand head and shoulders above the  level of the wall     when these were completed the whole of the garrison  including the  ladies and native servants  again set to work filling sandbags with  earth  as fast as they were finished they were carried in and piled two  deep against the lower windows  and three deep against the doors  only  one small door being left undefended  so as to allow a passage in and  out of the house  bags were piled in readiness for closing this also in  case of necessity     mrs  rintoul and another lady had volunteered for a third watch on the  roof  so that each watch would go on duty once every twelve hours  the  whole of the men  therefore  were available for work below     a scattered fire was opened at the house soon after daybreak  and  was kept up without intermission from bushes and other cover  but the  watchers on the roof  seated behind the sandbags at opposite angles   were well under shelter  peering out occasionally through the crevices  between the bags to see that no general movement was taking place among  the enemy     about midday there was a desultory discharge of firearms from the native  lines  and the major  on ascending to the roof  saw a procession of  elephants and men approaching the camp      i expect there are guns there   he muttered   and they are going to  begin in earnest  ladies  you are relieved of duty at present  i expect  we shall be hearing from those fellows soon  and we must have someone up  here who can talk back to them      accordingly the doctor and mr  farquharson  who was the best shot among  the civilians  took the places of the ladies on the roof  half an hour  later the major went up again      they have four cannon   the doctor said   there they are  on that  slight rise to the left of the lines  i should fancy they are about  eight hundred yards away  do you see  there is a crowd gathering behind  them  our rifles will carry that distance easily enough  i think  you  might as well let us have three or four more up here   the two lads are  both fair shots  and hunter was considered a good shikari some years  ago  we can drive their cannon off that rise  the farther we make them  take up their post the better  but even at that distance their shooting  will be wild  the guns are no doubt old ones  and  as likely as not  the  shot won t fit  at any rate  though they may trouble us  they will do no  serious harm till they establish a battery at pretty close quarters      the major went down  and the two subalterns and mr  hunter joined the  doctor on the roof     ten minutes later the boom of four guns in quick succession was heard   and the party below stopped for a moment at their work as they heard the  sound of shot rushing through the air overhead  then came five shots in  answer from the parapet  again and again the rifles spoke out  and then  the doctor shouted down to those in the courtyard   they have had enough  of it already  and are bringing up the elephants to move the cannon  back  now  boys   he said to the subalterns   an elephant is an easier  mark than a tiger  aim carefully  and blaze away as quickly as you  like      for five minutes a rapid fire was kept up  then wilson went below      the doctor asked me to tell you  sir   he said to the major   that  the guns have been removed  there has been great confusion among the  natives  and we can see with our glasses eight or ten bodies left on the  ground  one of the elephants turned and went off at full speed among the  crowd  and we fancy some of the others were hit  there was great trouble  in getting them to come up to the guns  the doctor says it is all over  for the present      two other large parties with elephants were seen to come up to the  native lines in the course of the afternoon  the defenders of the roof  had now turned their attention to their foes in the gardens around  and  the fire thence was gradually suppressed  until by evening everything  was quiet     by this time the work of filling the sandbags was completed  the doors  and windows had been barricaded  and a large pile of bags lay in the  inclosure ready for erection at any threatened point         chapter xv       when the party met at dinner they were for a time somewhat silent  for  all were exhausted by their hard work under a blazing sun  but their  spirits rose under their surroundings     the native servants had laid the table with as scrupulous care as  usual  and  except that there was no display of flowers  no change was  observable     all had dressed after the work was over  and the men were in white  drill  and the ladies had  from custom  put on light evening gowns     the cook had prepared an excellent dinner  and as the champagne went  round no stranger would have supposed that the party had met under  unusual circumstances  the doctor and the two subalterns were  unaffectedly gay  and as the rest all made an effort to be cheerful  the  languor that had marked the commencement of the dinner soon wore off      wilson and richards are becoming quite sportsmen   the doctor said    they have tried their hands at tigers but could hardly have expected  to take part in elephant shooting  they can t quite settle between  themselves as to which it was who sent the rajah s elephant flying among  the crowd  both declare they aimed at that special beast  so  as there  is no deciding the point  we must consider the honor as divided       it was rather hard on us   isobel said   to be kept working below  instead of being up there seeing what was going on  but i consider we  quite did our full share towards the defense today  my hands are quite  sore with sewing up the mouths of those rough bags  i think the chief  honors that way lie with mrs  rintoul  i am sure she sewed more  bags than any of us  i had no idea that you were such a worker  mrs   rintoul       i used to be a quick worker  miss hannay  till lately  i have not  touched a needle since i came out to india       i should recommend you to keep it up  mrs  rintoul   the doctor said    it has done you more good than all my medicines  i don t believe i have  prescribed for you for the last month  and i haven t seen you looking so  well since you came out       i suppose i have not had time to feel ill  doctor   mrs  rintoul said   with a slight smile   all this has been a sort of tonic       and a very useful one  mrs  rintoul  we are all of us the better for a  little stirring up sometimes      captain forster had  as usual  secured a place next to isobel hannay  he  had been near her all day  carrying the bags as he filled them to her to  sew up  bathurst was sitting at the other end of the table  joining but  little in the conversation      i thought bathurst was going to faint again when the firing began  miss  hannay   captain forster said  in a low voice   it was quite funny to  see him give a little start each shot that was fired  and his face was  as white as my jacket  i never saw such a nervous fellow       you know he cannot help it  captain forster   isobel said indignantly    i don t think it is right to make fun of him for what is a great  misfortune       i am not making fun of him  miss hannay  i am pitying him       it did not sound like it   isobel said   i don t think you can  understand it  captain forster  it must be terrible to be like that       i quite agree with you there  i know i should drown myself or put a  bullet through my head if i could not show ordinary courage with a lot  of ladies going on working quietly round me       you must remember that mr  bathurst showed plenty of courage in going  out among the mutineers last night       yes  he did that very well  but you see  he talks the language so  thoroughly that  as he said himself  there was very little risk in it       i don t like you to talk so  captain forster   isobel said quietly   i  do not see much of mr  bathurst  i have not spoken to him half a dozen  times in the last month  but both my uncle and dr  wade have a high  opinion of him  and do not consider that he should be personally blamed  for being nervous under fire  i feel very sorry for him  and would much  rather that you did not make remarks like that about him  we have all  our weak points  and  no doubt  many of them are a good deal worse than  a mere want of nerve       your commands shall be obeyed  miss hannay  i did not know that  bathurst was a protege of the major s as well as of the estimable  doctor  or i would have said nothing against him       i don t think mr  bathurst is the sort of man to be anyone s protege   captain forster   isobel said coldly   however  i think we had better  change the subject      this captain forster did easily and adroitly  he had no special feeling  against bathurst save a contempt for his weakness  and as he had met him  but once or twice at the major s since he came to the station  he had  not thought of him in the light of a rival     just as dinner was over richards and one of the civilians came down from  the terrace      i think that there is something up  major  i can hear noises somewhere  near where mr  hunter s bungalow was       what sort of noises  richards       there is a sort of murmur  as if there were a good many men there       well  gentlemen  we had better go to our posts   the major said    doolan  please place your watch on the platforms by the wall  i will  take my party up onto the terrace  doctor  will you bring up some of  those rockets you made the other day  we must try and find out what they  are doing      as soon as he gained the terrace with his party  the major requested  everyone to remain perfectly still  and going forward to the parapet  listened intently  in three or four minutes he returned to the others      there is a considerable body of men at work there   he said   i can  hear muffled sounds like digging  and once or twice a sharp click  as  if a spade struck a stone  i am very much afraid they are throwing up a  battery there  i was in hopes they would have begun in the open  because  we could have commanded the approaches  but if they begin among the  trees  they can come in and out without our seeing them  and bring up  their guns by the road without our being able to interfere with them   mr  bathurst  will you take down word to captain doolan to put his men  on the platforms on that side  tell him that i am going to throw up a  rocket  as i believe they are erecting a battery near hunter s bungalow   and that his men are to be ready to give them a volley if they can  make them out  tell them not to expose themselves too much  for if they  really are at work there no doubt they have numbers of men posted in the  shrubs all about to keep down our fire  now  gentlemen  we will all lie  down by the parapet  take those spare rifles  and fire as quickly as you  can while the light of the rocket lasts  now  mr  wilson  we will get  you to send them up  the rest of you had better get in the corner and  stoop down behind the sandbags  you can lay your rifles on them  so as  to be able to fire as soon as you have lit the second rocket      the doctor soon came up with the rockets  he had made three dozen the  week before  and a number of blue lights  for the special purpose of  detecting any movement that the enemy might make at night      i will fire them myself   he said  as wilson offered to take them   i  have had charge of the fireworks in a score of fetes and that sort of  thing  and am a pretty good hand at it  there  we will lean them against  the sandbags  that is about it  now  are you all ready  major       all ready   replied the major     the doctor placed the end of his lighted cheroot against the touch  paper  there was a momentary pause  then a rushing sound  and the rocket  soared high in the air  and then burst  throwing out four or five white  fireballs  which lit up clearly the spot they were watching      there they are   the major exclaimed   just to the right of the  bungalow  there are scores of them      the rifles  both from the terrace and the platforms below  cracked out  in rapid succession  and another rocket flew up into the air and burst   before its light had faded out  each of the defenders had fired his four  shots  shouts and cries from the direction in which they fired showed  that many of the bullets had told  whilst almost immediately a sharp  fire broke out from the bushes round them      don t mind the fellows in the shrubs   the major said   but keep up  your fire on the battery  we know its exact position now  though we  cannot actually make them out       let them wait while i go down and get a bit of phosphorus   the doctor  said   i have some in the surgery  they will only throw away their fire  in the dark without it      he soon returned  and when all the fore and back sights had been rubbed  by the phosphorus the firing recommenced  and the doctor sent wilson  down with the phosphorus to the men on the platforms facing the  threatened point     bathurst was returning  after having given the message to captain  doolan  when mrs  hunter met him in the passage  she put her hand kindly  on his shoulder      now  mr  bathurst  if you will take my advice you will remain quietly  here  the doctor tells me they are going to open fire  and it is not the  least use your going there exposing yourself to be shot when you know  that you will be of no use  you showed us yesterday that you could be  of use in other ways  and i have no doubt you will have opportunities of  doing so again  i can assure you none of us will think any the worse  of you for not being able to struggle against a nervous affliction that  gives you infinite pain  if they were attacking it would be different  i  know you would be wanting to take your share then       thank you  mrs  hunter   he said   but i must go up  i grant that i  shall be of no use  but at least i will take any chance that the others  run of being shot  a man does not flinch from a painful operation  and   whatever the pain  it has to be faced  i may get used to it in time  but  whether i do or not i must go through it  though i do not say it doesn t  hurt      at this moment the rattle of musketry broke out above  bathurst gave a  violent start  and a low cry as of pain  then he rushed past mrs  hunter  and up the staircase to the terrace  when he staggered rather than  walked forward to the parapet  and threw himself down beside two figures  who were in the act of firing      is that you  bathurst   the major s voice asked   mind  man  don t lift  your head above the sandbags in that way  there  you had best lie quiet   the natives have no idea of attacking  and it is of no use throwing away  valuable ammunition by firing unless your hand is steady      but bathurst did not hear  and remained with his head above the line  of sandbags until the major put his hand on his shoulder and forced him  down  he might have put his hands over his ears to deaden the sound  for  in the darkness no one would have seen the action  but he would not do  so  but with clenched teeth and quivering nerves lay there until the  major said   i fancy we have stopped them working  now  doctor  do you   hunter  bathurst  and farquharson go and lie down for four hours  when i  will send for you to take our places  before you lie down will you tell  doolan to send half his party in  of course you will lie down in your  clothes  ready to fall in at your posts at a moment s notice       let me send another rocket up first  major  to see what they are doing   we can sleep tomorrow in the daytime  they won t dare to work under our  fire then  now  get ready  gentlemen  and don t throw away a shot  if  they are still working there      the light of the rocket showed that there were now no natives at the  spot where they had been seen at work      i thought it would be too hot for them  major  at such close quarters  as these  we must have played the mischief with them       all the better  doctor  we will send a few shots there occasionally to  show them we have not forgotten them  but the principal thing will be  to keep our ears open to see that they don t bring up ladders and try a  rush       i think there is no fear of that tonight  major  they would not have  set to work at the battery if they had any idea of trying to scale the  wall with ladders  that will come later on  but i don t think you will  be troubled any more tonight  except by these fellows firing away from  the bushes  and i should think they would get tired of wasting their  ammunition soon  it is fortunate we brought all the spare ammunition in  here       yes  they only had ten rounds of ball cartridge  and that must be  nearly used up by this time  they will have to make up their cartridges  in future  and cast their bullets  unless they can get a supply from  some of the other mutineers       well  you will send for us in four hours  major       you need not be afraid of my forgetting      dawn was just breaking when the relief were called up  the firing had  died away  and all was quiet      you will take command here  rintoul   the major said   i should keep  farquharson up here  if i were you  and leave the doctor and bathurst to  look after things in general  i think  doctor  it would be as well if we  appointed bathurst in charge of the general arrangements of the house   we have a good amount of stores  but the servants will waste them if  they are not looked after  i should put them on rations  bathurst  and  there might be regular rations of things served out for us too  then  it would fall in your province to see that the syces water and feed the  horses  you will examine the well regularly  and note whether there is  any change in the look of the water  i think you will find plenty to  do       thank you  major   bathurst said   i appreciate your kindness  and  for the present  at any rate  will gladly undertake the work of looking  after the stores and servants  but there is one thing i have been  thinking of  and which i should like to speak to you about at once  if  you could spare a minute or two before you turn in       what is that  bathurst       i think that we are agreed  major  that though we may hold this place  for a time  sooner or later we must either surrender or the place be  carried by storm      major hannay nodded      that is what it must come to  bathurst  if they will at last grant  us terms  well and good  if not  we must either try to escape or die  fighting       it is about the escape i have been thinking  major  as our position  grows more and more desperate they will close round us  and although we  might have possibly got through last night  our chances of doing so when  they have once broken into the inclosure and begin to attack the house  itself are very slight  a few of us who can speak the language well  might possibly in disguise get away  but it would be impossible for the  bulk of us to do so       i quite see that  bathurst       my proposal is  major  that we should begin at once to mine  that is   to drive a gallery from the cellar  and to carry it on steadily as far  as we can  i should say that we have ten days or a fortnight before us  before matters get to an extremity  and in that time we ought to be able  to get  working night and day  from fifty to a hundred yards beyond the  wall  aiming at a clump of bushes  there is a large one in farquharson s  compound  about a hundred yards off  then  when things get to the worst   we can work upwards  and come out on a dark night  we might leave a long  fuse burning in the magazine  so that there should be an explosion an  hour or two after we had left  there is enough powder there to bring the  house down  and the sepoys might suppose that we had all been buried in  the ruins       i think the idea is a very good one  bathurst  what do you think   doctor       capital   the doctor said   it is a light sandy soil  and we should  be able to get through it at a pretty good rate  how many can work  together  do you think  bathurst       i should say two of us in each shift  to drive  and  if necessary  prop  the roof  with some of the natives to carry out the earth  if we have  three shifts  each shift would go on twice in the twenty four hours   that would be four hours on and eight hours off       will you take charge of the operation  bathurst       with pleasure  major       very well then  you shall have with you wilson and richards and the  three youngest of the civilians  saunderson  austin  and herbert  you  six will be relieved from other duty except when the enemy threaten an  attack  i will put down saunderson and austin together  which of the  others would you like to have with you       i will take wilson  sir       very well  then  richards and herbert will make the third party  after  breakfast we can pick out the twelve strongest of the natives  i will  tell them that they have to work  but that they will be each paid half  a rupee a day in addition to their ordinary wages  then you will give a  general supervision to the work  bathurst  in addition to your own share  in it       certainly  major  i will take general charge of it      so at breakfast the major explained the plan agreed upon  the five men  chosen at once expressed their willingness to undertake the work  and  the offer of half a rupee extra a day was sufficient to induce twelve of  the servants to volunteer for it  the major went down to the cellars  and fixed upon the spot at which the work should begin  and bathurst and  wilson  taking some of the intrenching tools from the storeroom  began  to break through the wall without delay      i like this   wilson said   it is a thousand times better than sitting  up there waiting till they choose to make an attack  how wide shall we  make it       as narrow as we can for one to pass along at a time   bathurst said    the narrower it is  the less trouble we shall have with the roof       but only one will be able to work at a time in that case       that will be quite enough    bathurst said   it will be hot work and  hard  we will relieve each other every five minutes or so      a very short time sufficed to break through the wall      thank goodness  it is earth   wilson said  thrusting a crowbar through  the opening as soon as it was made      i had no fear of its being rock  wilson  if it had been  they would not  have taken the trouble to have walled the sides of the cellar  the soil  is very deep all over here  the natives have to line their wells thirty  or forty feet down      the enemy were quiet all day  but the garrison thought it likely that   warned by the lesson of the night before  they were erecting a battery  some distance farther back  masked by the trees  and that until it was  ready to open fire they would know nothing about it      so you have turned miner  mr  wilson   isobel hannay said to him as   after a change and a bath  he came in to get his lunch      i calculate i have lost half a stone in weight  miss hannay  if i were  to go on at this for a month or two there would be nothing left of me       and how far did you drive the hole       gallery  miss hannay  please call it a gallery  it sounds so much  better  we got in five yards  i should hardly have believed it possible   but bathurst is a tremendous fellow to work  he uses a pick as if he had  been a sapper all his life  we kept the men pretty hard at work  i can  tell you  carrying up the earth  richards is at work now  and i bet him  five rupees that he and herbert don t drive as far as we did       there is not much use in betting now  mr  wilson   isobel said sadly      no  i suppose not  miss hannay  but it gives a sort of interest to  one s work  i have blistered my hands horribly  but i suppose they will  get hard in a day or two       i wish we could work at something   isobel said   now that we have  finished with the bags and bandages  the time seems very long  the only  thing there is to do is to play with the children and try to keep them  good  it is fortunate there is a bit of garden for them to play in       it is not much of a garden  miss hannay  we had something like a garden  when i was a boy at home  the governor s is a jolly old rectory  with a  splendid garden  what fun we used to have there when i was a young one   i wonder what the dear old governor and mater would say if they knew the  fix we were in here  you know  sometimes i think that forster s plan  was the best  and that it would be better to try and make a dash through  them       we are in your way  mr  wilson  you wouldn t be able to do much  fighting if you had one of us clinging to you       i don t know  miss hannay   wilson said quietly   what my fighting  powers are  but i fancy if you were clinging to me i could cut my way  through a good deal       i am sure you would do anything that anyone could do   the girl said  kindly   but whatever you might feel  having another person behind  you could not but hamper you awfully  i would infinitely rather try to  escape on foot  for then i should be relying on myself  while if i was  riding behind anyone  and we were pursued or attacked  i should feel all  the time i was destroying his chances  and that if it were not for me  he would get away  that would be terrible  i don t know whether we were  wise to stay here instead of trying to escape at once  but as uncle and  mr  hunter and the others all thought it wiser to stay  i have no doubt  it was  but i am quite sure that it could not have been a good plan to  go off like that on horseback      another day passed quietly  and then during the night the watch heard  the sounds of blows with axes  and of falling trees      they are clearing the ground in front of their battery   the major   who was on the watch with his party  said   it will begin in earnest  tomorrow morning  the sound came from just where we expected  it is  about in the same line as where they made their first attempt  but a  hundred yards or so further back      at daylight they saw that the trees and bushes had been leveled  and a  battery  with embrazures for six guns  erected at a distance of about  four hundred yards from the house  more sandbags were at once brought up  from below  and the parapet  on the side facing the battery  raised two  feet and doubled in thickness  the garrison were not disturbed while so  engaged      why the deuce don t the fellows begin   captain forster said  impatiently  as he stood looking over the parapet when the work was  finished      i expect they are waiting for the rajah and some of the principal  zemindars to come down   replied the major   the guns are theirs  you  see  and will most likely be worked by their own followers  no doubt  they think they will knock the place to pieces in a few minutes      listen  there is music  they are coming in grand state  rintoul  will  you tell the workers in the mine to come up  by the way  who are at work  now       bathurst and wilson  sir       then tell wilson to come up  and request bathurst to go on with the  gallery  tell him i want that pushed forward as fast as possible  and  that one gun will not make much difference here  request the ladies and  children to go down into the storeroom for the present  i don t think  the balls will go through the wall  but it is as well to be on the safe  side      captain rintoul delivered his message to the ladies  they had already  heard that the battery had been unmasked and was ready to open fire  and  lamps had been placed in the storeroom in readiness for them  there  were pale faces among them  but their thoughts were of those on the roof  rather than of themselves     mrs  hunter took up the bible she had been reading  and said   tell  them  captain rintoul  we shall be praying for them   the ladies went  into the room that served as a nursery  and with the ayahs and other  female servants carried the children down into the storeroom      i would much rather be up there   isobel said to mrs  doolan   we could  load the muskets for them  and i don t think it would be anything  like so bad if we could see what was going on as being cooped up below  fancying the worst all the time       i quite agree with you  but men never will get to understand women   perhaps before we are done they will recognize the fact that we are no  more afraid than they are      the music was heard approaching along the road where the bungalows had  stood  presently a number of flags were raised in the battery amid a  great beating of drums  on the previous day a flagstaff had been erected  on the roof  and a union jack was run up in answer to the enemy s  demonstration      a cheer for the old flag  lads   the major said  and a hearty cheer  broke from the little party on the roof  where  with the exception of  bathurst  all the garrison were assembled  the cheer was answered by a  yell from the natives not only in the battery  but from the gardens and  inclosures round the house      pay no attention to the fellows in the gardens   the major said   fire  at their guns  they must expose themselves to load      the men were kneeling behind the parapet  where the sandbags had been  so arranged that they could see through between those on the upper line   and thus fire without raising their heads above it      shall we wait for them or fire first  major   the doctor asked      i expect the guns are loaded and laid  doctor  but if you see a head  looking along them  by all means take a shot at it  i wish we could see  down into the battery itself  but it is too high for that      the doctor lay looking along his rifle  presently he fired  and as if  it had been the signal five cannon boomed out almost at the same moment   the other being fired a quarter of a minute later  three of the shot  struck the house below the parapet  the others went overhead      i hit my man   the doctor said  as he thrust another rifle through the  loophole   now  we will see if we can keep them from loading      simultaneously with the roar of the cannon a rattle of musketry broke  out on three sides of the house  and a hail of bullets whistled over the  heads of the defenders  who opened a steady fire at the embrasures of  the guns  these had been run in  and the natives could be seen loading  them  the major examined the work through a pair of field glasses      you are doing well   he said presently   i have seen several of them  fall  and there is a lot of confusion among them  they will soon get  tired of that game      slowly and irregularly the guns were run out again  and the fire of the  defenders was redoubled to prevent them from taking aim  only one shot  hit the house this time  the others all going overhead  the fire of the  enemy became slower and more irregular  and at the end of an hour ceased  almost entirely      doctor   the major said   i will get you and farquharson to turn your  attention to some fellows there are in that high tree over there  they  command us completely  and many of their bullets have struck on the  terrace behind us  it would not be safe to move across to the stairs  now  i think we have pretty well silenced the battery for the present   here are my glasses  with them you can easily make out the fellows among  the leaves       i see them   the doctor said  handing the glasses to farquharson   we  will soon get them out of that  now  farquharson  you take that fellow  out on the lower branch to the right  i will take the one close to the  trunk on the same branch      laying their rifles on the upper row of sandbags  the two men took a  steady aim  they fired almost together  and two bodies were seen to fall  from the tree      well shot   the major exclaimed   there are something like a dozen of  them up there  but they will soon clear out if you keep that up       they are not more than two hundred yards away   the doctor said   and  firing from a rest we certainly ought not to miss them at that distance   give me the glasses again      a similar success attended the next two shots  and then a number of  figures were seen hastily climbing down      give them a volley  gentlemen   the major said     a dozen guns were fired  and three more men dropped  and an angry yell  from the natives answered the shout of triumph from the garrison      will you go down  mr  hunter  and tell the ladies that we have silenced  the guns for the present  and that no one has received a scratch  now   let us see what damage their balls have effected      this was found to be trifling  the stonework of the house was strong   and the guns were light  the stonework of one of the windows was broken   and two or three stones in the wall cracked  one ball had entered a  window  torn its way through two inner walls  and lay against the back  wall      it is a four pound ball   the major said  taking it up   i fancy the  guns are seven pounders  they have evidently no balls to fit  which  accounts for the badness of their firing and the little damage they did   with so much windage the balls can have had but small velocity  well   that is a satisfactory beginning  gentlemen  they will take a long time  to knock the place about our ears at this rate  now we will see if we  cannot clear them out of the gardens  captain doolan  will you take the  glasses and watch the battery  if you see any movement about the guns   the fire will be reopened at once  until then all will devote their  attention to those fellows among the bushes  it is important to teach  them that they are not safe there  for a chance ball might come in  between the sandbags  each of you pick out a particular bush  and watch  it till you see the exact position in which anyone firing from it must  be in  and then try to silence him  don t throw away a shot if you can  help it  we have a good stock of ammunition  but it is as well not to  waste it  i will leave you in command at present  doolan      major hannay then went down to the storeroom      i have come to relieve you from your confinement  ladies   he said   i  am glad to say that we find their balls will not penetrate the walls  of the house alone  and there is therefore no fear whatever of their  passing through them and the garden wall together  therefore  as long  as the wall is intact  there is no reason whatever why you should not  remain on the floor above      there was a general exclamation of pleasure      that will be vastly better  uncle   isobel said   it is hateful being  hidden away down here when we have nothing to do but to listen to the  firing  we don t see why some of us should not go up on the terrace to  load the rifles for you       not at present  isobel  we are not pressed yet  when it comes to a real  attack it will be time to consider about that  i don t think any of us  would shoot straighter if there were women right up among us in danger       i don t at all see why it should be worse our being in danger than for  you men  major   mrs  doolan said   we have just as much at stake  and  more  and i warn you i shall organize a female mutiny if we are not  allowed to help      the major laughed      well  mrs  doolan  i shall have to convert this storeroom into a  prison  and all who defy my authority will be immured here  so now you  know the consequence of disobedience       and has no one been hurt with all that firing  major hannay   mary  hunter asked      a good many people have been hurt  miss hunter  but no one on our side   i fancy we must have made it very hot for those at the guns  and the  doctor and mr  farquharson have been teaching them not to climb trees   at present that firing you hear is against those who are hiding in the  gardens      an hour later the firing ceased altogether  the natives finding the fire  of the defenders so deadly that they no longer dared  by discharging a  rifle  to show where they were hiding  they had drawn off from the more  distant clumps and bushes  but dared not try and crawl from those nearer  the house until after nightfall     the next morning it was found that during the night the enemy had closed  up their embrasures  leaving only openings sufficiently large for the  muzzles of the guns to be thrust through  and soon after daybreak they  renewed their fire  the doctor and mr  farquharson alone remained on  the roof  and throughout the day they kept up a steady fire at these  openings whenever the guns were withdrawn  several of the sandbags were  knocked off the parapet during the course of the day  and a few shot  found their way through the walls of the upper story  but beyond this  no damage was done  the mining was kept up with great vigor  and the  gallery advanced rapidly  the servants finding it very hard work to  remove the earth as fast as the miners brought it down     captain forster offered to go out with three others at night to try  and get into the battery and spike the guns  but major hannay would not  permit the attempt to be made      we know they have several other guns   he said   and the risk would be  altogether too great  for there would be practically no chance of your  getting back and being drawn up over the wall before you were overtaken   even if you succeeded in spiking the guns  there are probably a hundred  men sleeping in the battery  and it is likely they would have sentries  out in front of it  the loss of four men would seriously weaken the  garrison      the next morning another battery to the left was unmasked  and on  the following day three guns were planted  under cover  so as to play  against the gate  the first battery now concentrated its fire upon the  outer wall  the new battery played upon the upper part of the house  and  the three guns kept up a steady fire at the gate     there was little rest for the besieged now  it was a constant duel  between their rifles and the guns  varied by their occasionally turning  their attention to men who climbed trees  or who  from the roofs of some  buildings still standing  endeavored to keep down their fire     wilson had been released from his labors in the gallery  bathurst  undertaking to get down the earth single handed as fast as the servants  could remove it      i never saw such a fellow to work  miss hannay   wilson said one day   when he was off duty  and happened to find her working alone at some  bandages   i know you don t like him  but he is a first rate fellow if  there ever was one  it is unlucky for him being so nervous at the guns   but that is no fault of his  after all  and i am sure in other things he  is as cool as possible  yesterday i was standing close to him  shoving  the earth back to the men as he got it down  suddenly he shouted   run   wilson  the roof is coming down   i could not help bolting a few yards   for the earth came pattering down as he spoke  then i looked round and  saw him standing there  by the light of the lamp  like those figures  you see holding up pillars  i forget what they call them  catydigs  or  something of that sort       caryatides   isobel put in      yes  that is the name  some timber had given way above him  and he was  holding it up with his arms  i should say that there must have been  half a ton of it  and he said  as quietly as possible   get two of those  short poles  wilson  and put up one on each side of me  i can hold it a  bit  but don t be longer than you can help about it   i managed to shove  up the timber  so that he could slip out before it came down  it would  have crushed us both to a certainty if he had not held it up       why do you say you know i don t like mr  bathurst       i don t exactly know  miss hannay  but i have noticed you are the only  lady who does not chat with him  i don t think i have seen you speak  to him since we have come in here  i am sorry  because i like him very  much  and i don t care for forster at all       what has captain forster to do with it   isobel asked  somewhat  indignantly      oh  nothing at all  miss hannay  only  you know  bathurst used to be  a good deal at the major s before forster came  and then after that i  never met him there except on that evening before he came in here  now  you know  miss hannay   he went on earnestly   what i think about you  i  have not been such an ass as to suppose i ever had a chance  though you  know i would lay down my life for you willingly  but i did not seem to  mind bathurst  i know he is an awfully good fellow  and would have  made you very happy  but i don t feel like that with forster  there is  nothing in the world that i should like better than to punch his head   and when i see that a fellow like that has cut bathurst out altogether  it makes me so savage sometimes that i have to go and smoke a pipe  outside so as not to break out and have a row with him       you ought not to talk so  mr  wilson  it is very wrong  you have  no right to say that anyone has cut anyone else out as far as i am  concerned  i know you are all fond of me in a brotherly sort of way   and i like you very much  but that gives you no right to say such  things about other people  mr  bathurst ceased his visits not because of  captain forster but from another reason altogether  and certainly i  have neither said nor done anything that would justify your saying that  captain forster had cut mr  bathurst out  even if i had  you ought not  to have alluded to such a thing  i am not angry with you   she said   seeing how downcast he looked   but you must not talk like that any  more  it would be wrong at any time  it is specially so now  when we are  all shut up here together  and none can say what will happen to us       it seemed to me that was just the reason why i could speak about it   miss hannay  we may none of us get out of this fix we are in  and i  do think we ought all to be friends together now  richards and i both  agreed that as it was certain neither of us had a chance of winning you   the next best thing was to see you and bathurst come together  well  now  all that s over  of course  but is it wrong for me to ask  how is it you  have come to dislike him       but i don t dislike him  mr  wilson       well  then  why do you go on as if you didn t like him      isobel hesitated  from most men she would have considered the question  impertinent  and would have resented it  but this frank faced boy meant  no impertinence  he loved her in his honest way  and only wanted to see  her happy      i can t speak to him if he doesn t speak to me   she said desperately      no  of course not   he agreed   but why shouldn t he speak to you  you  can t have done anything to offend him except taking up with forster       it is nothing to do with captain forster at all  mr  wilson  i    and  she hesitated   i said something at which he had the right to feel hurt  and offended  and he has never given me any opportunity since of saying  that i was sorry       i am sure you would not have said anything that he should have been  offended about  miss hannay  it is not your nature  and i would not  believe it whoever told me  not even yourself  so he must be in fault   and  of course  i have nothing more to say about it       he wasn t in fault at all  mr  wilson  i can t tell you what i said   but it was very wrong and thoughtless on my part  and i have been sorry  for it ever since  and he has a perfect right to be hurt and not to  come near me  especially as   and she hesitated   as i have acted badly  since  and he has no reason for supposing that i am sorry  and now you  must not ask me any more about it  i don t know why i have said as much  to you as i have  only i know i can trust you  and i like you very much   though i could never like you in the sort of way you would want me to  i  wish you didn t like me like that       oh  never mind me   he said earnestly   i am all right  miss hannay  i  never expected anything  you know  so i am not disappointed  and it has  been awfully good of you talking to me as you have  and not getting  mad with me for interfering  but i can hear them coming down from the  terrace  and i must be off  i am on duty there  you know  now  bathurst  has undertaken double work in that hole  i didn t like it  really  it  seemed mean to be getting out of the work and letting him do it all  but  he said that he liked work  and i really think he does  i am sure he is  always worrying himself because he can t take his share in the firing on  the roof  and when he is working he hasn t time to think about it  when  he told me that in future he would drive the tunnel our shift himself   he said   that will enable you to take your place on the roof  wilson   and you must remember you are firing for both of us  so don t throw  away a shot   it is awfully rough on him  isn t it  well  goodby  miss  hannay   and wilson hurried off to the roof         chapter xvi       the next four days made a great alteration in the position of the  defenders in the fortified house     the upper story was now riddled by balls  the parapet round the terrace  had been knocked away in several places  the gate was in splinters  but  as the earth from the tunnel had been all emptied against the sandbags   it had grown to such a thickness that the defense was still good here   but in the wall  against which one of the new batteries had steadily  directed its fire  there was a yawning gap  which was hourly increasing  in size  and would ere long be practicable for assault  many of the  shots passing through this had struck the house itself  some of these  had penetrated  and the room in the line of fire could no longer be  used     there had been several casualties  the young civilian herbert had  been killed by a shot that struck the parapet just where he was lying   captain rintoul had been seriously wounded  two of the natives had been  killed by the first shot which penetrated the lower room  mr  hunter  was prostrate with fever  the result of exposure to the sun  and several  others had received wounds more or less severe from fragments of stone   but the fire of the defenders was as steady as at first  and the loss of  the natives working the guns was severe  and they no longer ventured to  fire from the gardens and shrubberies round the walls     fatigue  watching  still more the heat on the terrace  was telling  heavily upon the strength of the garrison  the ladies went about  their work quietly and almost silently  the constant anxiety and the  confinement in the darkened rooms were telling upon them too  several of  the children were ill  and when not employed in other things  there  were fresh sandbags to be made by the women  to take the place of those  damaged by the enemy s shot     when  of an evening  a portion of the defenders came off duty  there was  more talk and conversation  as all endeavored to keep up a good face and  assume a confidence they were far from feeling  the doctor was perhaps  the most cheery of the party  during the daytime he was always on the  roof  and his rifle seldom cracked in vain  in the evening he attended  to his patients  talked cheerily to the ladies  and laughed and joked  over the events of the day     none among the ladies showed greater calmness and courage than mrs   rintoul  and not a word was ever heard from the time the siege began  of her ailments or inconveniences  she was mrs  hunter s best assistant  with the sick children  even after her husband was wounded  and her  attention night and day was given to him  she still kept on patiently  and firmly      i don t know how to admire mrs  rintoul enough   mrs  hunter said to  isobel hannay one day   formerly i had no patience with her  she was  always querulous and grumbling  now she has turned out a really noble  woman  one never knows people  my dear  till one sees them in trouble       everyone is nice   isobel said   i have hardly heard a word of  complaint about anything since we came here  and everyone seems to help  others and do little kindnesses      the enemy s fire had been very heavy all that day  and the breach in  the wall had been widened  and the garrison felt certain that the enemy  would attack on the following morning      you and farquharson  doctor  must stop on the roof   the major said    in the first place  it is possible they may try to attack by ladders at  some other point  and we shall want two good shots up there to keep them  back  and in the second  if they do force the breach  we shall want you  to cover our retreat into the house  i will get a dozen rifles for each  of you loaded and in readiness  isobel and mary hunter  who have both  volunteered over and over again  shall go up to load  they have both  practiced  and can load quickly  of course if you see that the enemy  are not attacking at any other point  you will help us at the breach  by keeping up a steady fire on them  but always keep six guns each in  reserve  i shall blow my whistle as a signal for us to retire to the  house if i find we can hold the breach no longer  so when you hear that  blaze away at them as fast as you can  your twelve shots will check them  long enough to give us time to get in and fasten the door  we shall  be round the corner of the house before they can get fairly over the  breastwork  we will set to work to raise that as soon as it gets dark      a breastwork of sandbags had already been erected behind the breach  in  case the enemy should make a sudden rush  and a couple of hours  labor  transformed this into a strong work  for the bags were already filled   and only needed placing in position  when completed  it extended in a  horseshoe shape  some fifteen feet across  behind the gap in the wall   for nine feet from the ground it was composed of sandbags three deep   and a single line was then laid along the edge to serve as a parapet      i don t think they will get over that   the major said  when the work  was finished   i doubt if they will be disposed even to try when they  reach the breach      before beginning their work they had cleared away all the fallen  brickwork from behind the breach  and a number of bricks were laid on  the top of the sandbags to be used as missiles      a brick is as good as a musket ball at this distance   the major said    and when our guns are empty we can take to them  there are enough spare  rifles for us to have five each  and  with those and our revolvers and  the bricks  we ought to be able to account for an army  there are some  of the servants and syces who can be trusted to load  they can stand  down behind us  and we can pass our guns down to them as we empty them      each man had his place on the work assigned to him  bathurst  who had  before told the major that when the time came for an assault to be  delivered he was determined to take his place in the breach  was placed  at one end of the horseshoe where it touched the wall      i don t promise to be of much use  major   he said quietly   i know  myself too well  but at least i can run my chance of being killed      the major had put wilson next to him      i don t think there is much chance of their storming the work  wilson   but if they do  you catch hold of bathurst s arm  and drag him away  when you hear me whistle  the chances are a hundred to one against his  hearing it  or remembering what it means if he does hear it       all right  major  i will look to him      four men remained on guard at the breach all night  and at the first  gleam of daylight the garrison took up their posts      now mind  my dears   the doctor said  as he and farquharson went up on  the terrace with isobel and mary hunter   you must do exactly as you are  told  or you will be doing more harm than good  for farquharson and i  would not be able to pay attention to our shooting  you must lie down  and remain perfectly quiet till we begin to fire  then keep behind us  just so far that you can reach the guns as we hand them back to you  after firing  and you must load them either kneeling or sitting down   so that you don t expose your heads above the thickest part of the  breastwork  when you have loaded  push the guns back well to the right  of us  but so that we can reach them  then  if one of them goes off   there won t be any chance of our being hit  the garrison can t afford to  throw away a life at present  you will  of course  only half cock them   still  it is as well to provide against accidents      both the girls were pale  but they were quiet and steady  the doctor saw  they were not likely to break down      that is a rum looking weapon you have got there  bathurst   wilson  said  as  after carrying down the spare guns and placing them ready for  firing  they lay down in their positions on the sandbags  the weapon  was a native one  and was a short mace  composed of a bar of iron about  fifteen inches long  with a knob of the same metal  studded with spikes   the bar was covered with leather to break the jar  and had a loop to put  the hand through at the end      yes   bathurst said quietly   i picked it up at one of the native shops  in cawnpore the last time i was there  i had no idea then that i might  ever have to use it  and bought it rather as a curiosity  but i have  kept it within reach of my bedside since these troubles began  and i  don t think one could want a better weapon at close quarters       no  it is a tremendous thing  and after the way i have seen you using  that pick i should not like to be within reach of your arm with that  mace in it  i don t think there is much chance of your wanting that  i  have no fear of the natives getting over here this time       i have no fear of the natives at all   bathurst said      i am only afraid of myself  at present i am just as cool as if there  was not a native within a thousand miles  and i am sure that my pulse is  not going a beat faster than usual  i can think of the whole thing and  calculate the chances as calmly as if it were an affair in which i was  in no way concerned  it is not danger that i fear in the slightest  it  is that horrible noise  i know well enough that the moment the firing  begins i shall be paralyzed  my only hope is that at the last moment  if  it comes to hand to hand fighting  i shall get my nerve       i have no doubt you will   wilson said warmly   and when you do i would  back you at long odds against any of us  ah  they are beginning      as he spoke there was a salvo of all the guns on the three sepoy  batteries  then a roar of musketry broke out round the house  and above  it could be heard loud shouts      they are coming  major   the doctor shouted down from the roof   the  sepoys are leading  and there is a crowd of natives behind them      those lying in the middle of the curve of the horseshoe soon caught  sight of the enemy advancing tumultuously towards the breach  the major  had ordered that not a shot was to be fired until they reached it  and  it was evident that the silence of the besieged awed the assailants with  a sense of unknown danger  for their pace slackened  and when they got  to within fifty yards of the breach they paused and opened fire  then   urged forward by their officers and encouraged by their own noise  they  again rushed forward  two of their officers led the way  and as these  mounted the little heap of rubbish at the foot of the breach  two rifles  cracked out from the terrace  and both fell dead     there was a yell of fury from the sepoys  and then they poured in  through the breach  those in front tried to stop as they saw the trap  into which they were entering  but pressed on by those behind they were  forced forward     and now a crackling fire of musketry broke out from the rifles  projecting between the sandbags into the crowded mass  every shot told   wild shrieks  yells  and curses rose from the assailants  some tried  madly to climb up the sandbags  some to force their way back through  the crowd behind  some threw themselves down  others discharged their  muskets at their invisible foe  from the roof the doctor and his  companion kept up a rapid fire upon the crowd struggling to enter the  breach  as fast as the defenders  muskets were discharged they handed  them down to the servants behind to be reloaded  and when each had fired  his spare muskets he betook himself to his revolver     wilson  while discharging his rifle  kept his eyes upon bathurst  the  latter had not fired a shot  but lay rigid and still  save for a sort of  convulsive shuddering  presently there was a little lull in the firing  as the weapons were emptied  and the defenders seizing the bricks hurled  them down into the mass      look out   the major shouted   keep your heads low  i am going to throw  the canisters      a number of these had been prepared  filled to the mouth with powder and  bullets  and with a short fuse attached  ropes being fastened round them  to enable them to be slung some distance  the major half rose to throw  one of these missiles when his attention was called by a shout from  wilson     the latter was so occupied that he had not noticed bathurst  who had  suddenly risen to his feet  and just as wilson was about to grasp him  and pull him down  leaped over the sandbag in front of him down among  the mutineers  the major gave a swing to the canister  of which the fuse  was already lighted  and hurled it through the breach among the crowd   who  ignorant of what was going on inside  were still struggling to  enter      look out   he shouted to the others   mind how you throw  bathurst is  down in the middle of them  hand up all the muskets you have loaded   he  cried to the servants     as he spoke he swung another canister through the breach  and almost  immediately two heavy explosions followed  one close upon the other      give them a volley at the breach   he shouted   never mind those  below      the muskets were fired as soon as received      now to your feet   the major cried   and give them the brickbats   and  as he stood up he hurled two more canisters among the crowd behind the  breach  the others sprang up with a cheer  the inclosure below them was  shallower now from the number that had fallen  and was filled with a  confused mass of struggling men  in their midst was bathurst fighting  desperately with his short weapon  and bringing down a man at every  blow  the mutineers being too crowded together to use their unfixed  bayonets against him  in a moment captain forster leaped down  sword in  hand  and joined bathurst in the fight      stand steady   the major shouted   don t let another man move      but the missiles still rained down with an occasional shot  as the  rifles were handed up by the natives  while the doctor and farquharson  kept up an almost continuous fire from the terrace  then the two last  canisters thrown by the major exploded  the first two had carried havoc  among the crowd behind the breach  these completed their confusion  and  they turned and fled  while those in the retrenchment  relieved of the  pressure from behind  at once turned  and flying through the breach   followed their companions     a loud cheer broke from the garrison  and the major looking round saw  the doctor standing by the parapet waving his hat  while isobel stood  beside him looking down at the scene of conflict      lie down  isobel   he shouted   they will be opening fire again  directly      the girl disappeared  and almost at the same moment the batteries spoke  out again  and a crackle of the musketry began from the gardens  the  major turned round  bathurst was leaning against the wall breathing  heavily after his exertions  forster was coolly wiping his sword on the  tunic of one of the fallen sepoys      are either of you hurt   he asked      i am not hurt to speak of   forster said   i got a rip with a bayonet  as i jumped down  but i don t think it is of any consequence       how are you  bathurst   the major repeated   what on earth possessed  you to jump down like that       i don t know  major  i had to do something  and when you stopped firing  i felt it was time for me to do my share       you have done more than your share  i should say   the major said   for  they went down like ninepins before you  now  wilson  you take one of  his hands  and i will take the other  and help him up      it needed considerable exertion to get him up  for the reaction had now  come  and he was scarce able to stand      you had better go up to the house and get a glass of wine   the major  said   now  is anyone else hurt       i am hit  major   richards said quietly   a ball came in between the  sandbags just as i fired my first shot  and smashed my right shoulder  i  think i have not been much good since  though i have been firing from my  left as well as i could  i think i will go up and get the doctor to look  at it      but almost as he spoke the young fellow tottered  and would have fallen   had not the major caught him      lend me a hand  doolan   the latter said   we will carry him in  i am  afraid he is very hard hit      the ladies gathered round the major and captain doolan as they entered  with their burden  mary hunter had already run down and told them that  the attack had been repulsed and the enemy had retreated      nobody else is hit   the major said  as he entered   at least  not  seriously  the enemy have been handsomely beaten with such loss that  they won t be in a hurry to try again  will one of you run up and bring  the doctor down      richards was carried into the hospital room  where he was left to the  care of the doctor  mrs  hunter  and mrs  rintoul  the major returned to  the general room      boy  bring half a dozen bottles of champagne and open them as quickly  as you can   he said   we have got enough to last us for weeks  and this  is an occasion to celebrate  and i think we have all earned it      the others were by this time coming in  for there was no chance of the  enemy renewing the attack at present  farquharson was on the roof on the  lookout  quiet greetings were exchanged between wives and husbands      it didn t last long   wilson said   not above five minutes  i should  say  from the time when we opened fire       it seemed to us an age   amy hunter replied   it was dreadful not to be  able to see what was going on  it seemed to me everyone must be killed  with all that firing       it was sharp while it lasted   the major said   but we were all snug  enough except against a stray bullet  such as that which hit poor young  richards  he behaved very gallantly  and none of us knew he was hit till  it was all over       but how did captain forster get his bayonet wound   mrs  doolan asked    i saw him go in just now into the surgery  it seemed to me he had a  very serious wound  for his jacket was cut from the breast up to the  shoulder  and he was bleeding terribly  though he made light of it       he jumped down into the middle of them   the major said   bathurst  jumped down first  and was fighting like a madman with a mace he has  got  we could do nothing  for we were afraid of hitting him  and forster  jumped down to help him  and  as he did so  got that rip with the  bayonet  it is a nasty cut  no doubt  but it is only a flesh wound       where is mr  bathurst   mrs  doolan asked   is he hurt  too  why did he  jump down  i should not have thought   and she stopped      i fancy a sort of fury seized him   the major said   but whatever it  was  he fought like a giant  he is a powerful man  and that iron mace is  just the thing for such work  the natives went down like ninepins before  him  no  i don t think he is hurt       i will go out and see   mrs  doolan said  and taking a mug half full of  champagne from the table  she went out     bathurst was sitting on the ground leaning against the wall of the  house      you are not hurt  mr  bathurst  i hope   mrs  doolan said  as she came  up   no  don t try to get up  drink a little of this  we are celebrating  our victory by opening a case of champagne  the major tells us you have  been distinguishing yourself greatly      bathurst drank some of the wine before he replied      in a way  mrs  doolan  i scarcely know what i did do  i wanted to do  something  even if it was only to get killed       you must not talk like that   she said kindly   your life is as  valuable as any here  and you know that we all like and esteem you  and   at any rate  you have shown today that you have plenty of courage       the courage of a malay running amuck  mrs  doolan  that is not courage   it is madness  you cannot tell  no one can tell  what i have suffered  since the siege began  the humiliation of knowing that i alone of the  men here am unable to take my part in the defense  and that while others  are fighting i am useful only to work as a miner       but you are as useful in that way as you would be in the other   she  said   i don t feel humiliated because i can only help in nursing the  sick while the others are fighting for us  we have all of us our gifts   few men have more than you  you have courage and coolness in other ways   and you are wrong to care nothing for your life because of the failing   for which you are not accountable  of your nerves to stand the sound of  firearms   i can understand your feelings and sympathize with you  but  it is of no use to exaggerate the importance of such a matter  you might  live a thousand lives without being again in a position when such a  failing would be of the slightest importance  one way or the other  now  come in with me  certainly this is not the moment for you to give way  about it  for whatever your feelings may have been  or whatever may have  impelled you to the act  you have on this occasion fought nobly       not nobly  mrs  doolan   he said  rising to his feet   desperately  or  madly  if you like      at this moment wilson came out   halloa  bathurst  what are doing here   breakfast is just ready  and everyone is asking for you  i am sure  you must want something after your exertions  you should have seen him  laying about him with that iron mace  mrs  doolan   i have seen him  using the pick  and knew how strong he was  but i was astonished  i  can tell you  it was a sort of coeur de lion business  he used to use a  mace  you know  and once rode through the saracens and smashed them up   till at last  when he had done  he couldn t open his hand  bring him in   mrs  doolan  if he won t come  i will go in and send the doctor out  to him  bad business  poor richards being hurt  isn t it  awfully good  fellow  richards  can t think why he was the one to be hit      so keeping up a string of talk  the young subaltern led bathurst into  the house     after breakfast a white flag was waved from the roof  and in a short  time two sepoy officers came up with a similar flag  the major and  captain doolan went out to meet them  and it was agreed that hostilities  should be suspended until noon  in order that the wounded and dead might  be carried off     while this was being done the garrison remained under arms behind their  work at the breach lest any treacherous attempt should be made  the  mutineers  however  who were evidently much depressed by the  failure  carried the bodies off quietly  and at twelve o clock firing  recommenced     that evening  after it was dark  the men gathered on the terrace      well  gentlemen   the major said   we have beaten them off today  and  we may do it again  but there is no doubt how it must all end  you see   this afternoon their guns have all been firing at a fresh place in the  wall  and if they make another breach or two  and attack at them all  together  it will be hopeless to try to defend them  you see  now that  we have several sick and wounded  the notion of making our escape is  almost knocked on the head  at the last moment each may try to save his  life  but there must be no desertion of the sick and wounded as long as  there is a cartridge to be fired  our best hope is in getting assistance  from somewhere  but we know nothing of what is going on outside  i think  the best plan will be for one of our number to try to make his way out   and go either to lucknow  agra  or allahabad  and try and get help   if they could spare a troop of cavalry it might be sufficient  the  mutineers have suffered very heavily  there were over a hundred and  fifty bodies carried out today  and if attacked suddenly i don t think  they would make any great resistance  we may hold out for a week or ten  days  but i think that is the outside  and if rescue does not arrive by  that time we must either surrender or try to escape by that passage      there was a general assent      bathurst would be the man to do it   the doctor said   once through  their lines he could pass without exciting the slightest suspicion   he could buy a horse then  and could be at any of the stations in two  days       yes  there is no doubt that he is the man to do it   the major said    where is he now       at work as usual  major  shall i go and speak to him  but i tell you  fairly i don t think he will undertake it       why not  doctor  it is a dangerous mission  but no more dangerous than  remaining here       well  we shall see   the doctor said  as he left the group     nothing was said for a few minutes  the men sitting or lying about  smoking  presently the doctor returned      bathurst refuses absolutely   he said   he admits that he does not  think there would be much difficulty for him to get through  but he is  convinced that the mission would be a useless one  and that could help  have been spared it would have come to us before now       but in that case he would have made his escape   the major said      that is just why he won t go  major  he says that come what will he will  share the fate of the rest  and that he will not live to be pointed to  as the one man who made his escape of the garrison of deennugghur       whom can we send   the major said   you are the only other man who  speaks the language well enough to pass as a native  doctor       i speak it fairly  but not well enough for that  besides  i am too old  to bear the fatigue of riding night and day  and  moreover  my services  are wanted here both as a doctor and as a rifle shot       i will go  if you will send me  major   captain forster said suddenly    not in disguise  but in uniform  and on my horse s back  of course i  should run the gauntlet of their sentries  once through  i doubt if they  have a horse that could overtake mine      there was a general silence of surprise  forster s reckless courage was  notorious  and he had been conspicuous for the manner in which he had  chosen the most dangerous points during the siege  and this offer to  undertake what  although a dangerous enterprise in itself  still offered  a far better chance of life than that of remaining behind  surprised  everyone  it had been noticed that  since the rejection of his plan to  sally out in a body and cut their way through the enemy  he had been  moody and silent  except only when the fire was heavy and the danger  considerable  then he laughed and joked and seemed absolutely to enjoy  the excitement  but he was the last man whom any of them would have  expected to volunteer for a service that  dangerous as it might be  had  just been refused by bathurst on the ground that it offered a chance of  escape from the common lot     the major was the first to speak      well  captain forster  as we have just agreed that our only chance  is to obtain aid from one of the stations  and as you are the only  volunteer for the service  i do not see that i can decline to accept  your offer  at which station do you think you would be most likely to  find a force that could help us       i should say lucknow  major  if help is to be obtained anywhere  i  should say it was there       yes  i think that is the most hopeful  you will start at once  i  suppose the sooner the better       as soon as they are fairly asleep  say twelve o clock       very well  i will go and write a dispatch for you to carry  giving an  account of the fix we are in here  how will you sally out       i should think the easiest plan would be to make a gap in the sandbags  in the breach  lead the horse till fairly outside  and then mount       i think you had better take a spare horse with you   the doctor said    it will make a difference if you are chased  if you can change from one  to the other  bathurst told me to say whoever went could have his horse   which is a long way the best in the station  i should fancy as good as  your own       i don t know   forster said   led horses are a nuisance  still  as you  say  it might come in useful  if it is only to loose and turn down a  side road  and so puzzle anyone who may be after you in the dark      the major and forster left the roof together      well  that is a rum go   wilson said   if it had been anyone but  forster i should have said that he funked and was taking the opportunity  to get out of it  but everyone knows that he has any amount of pluck   look how he charged those sepoys single handed       there are two sorts of pluck  wilson   the doctor said dryly   there is  the pluck that will carry a man through a desperate action and lead him  to do deeds that are the talk of an army  forster possesses that kind of  pluck in an unusual degree  he is almost an ideal cavalryman  dashing   reckless  riding with a smile on his lips into the thickest of the fray   absolutely careless of life when his blood is up      there is another sort of courage  that which supports men under long  continued strain  and enables them  patiently and steadfastly  to face  death when they see it approaching step by step  i doubt whether forster  possesses that passive sort of courage  he would ride up to a cannon s  mouth  but would grow impatient in a  square of infantry condemned to  remain inactive under a heavy artillery fire      no one has changed more since this siege began than he has  except when  engaged under a heavy fire he has been either silent  or impatient and  short tempered  shirking conversation even with women when his turn  of duty was over  mind  i don t say for a moment that i suspect him of  being afraid of death  when the end came he would fight as bravely  as ever  and no one could fight more bravely  but he cannot stand the  waiting  he is always pulling his mustache moodily and muttering to  himself  he is good to do but not to suffer  he would make a shockingly  bad patient in a long illness      well  if any of you have letters you want to write to friends in  england i should advise you to take the opportunity  mind  i don t think  they will ever get them  forster may get through  but i consider the  chances strongly against it  for a ride of ten miles through a country  swarming with foes i could choose no messenger i would rather trust  but  for a ride like this  that requires patience and caution and resource   he is not the man i should select  bathurst would have succeeded almost  certainly if he had once got out  the two men are as different as light  to dark  one possesses just the points the other fails in  i have no one  at home i want to write to  so i will undertake the watch here          chapter xvii       the men on descending from the roof found all the ladies engaged in  writing  the major having told them that there was a chance of their  letters being taken out  scarce one looked up as they entered  their  thoughts at the moment were at home with those to whom they were writing  what might well be their last farewells  stifled sobs were heard in the  quiet room  mournful letters were blurred with tears even from eyes that  had not before been dimmed since the siege began     isobel hannay was the first to finish  for her letter to her mother was  but a short one  as she closed it she looked up  captain forster was  standing at the other side of the table with his eyes fixed on her   and he made a slight gesture to her that he wished to speak to her  she  hesitated a moment  and then rose and quietly left the room  a moment  later he joined her outside      come outside   he said   i must speak to you   and together they went  out through the passage into the courtyard      isobel   he began   i need not tell you that i love you  till lately  i have not known how much  but i feel now that i could not live without  you       why are you going away then  captain forster   she asked quietly      i don t want to go alone   he said   i cannot go alone  i want you to  go with me  your uncle would surely consent  it is the only chance of  saving your life  we all know that it is next to hopeless that a force  sufficient to rescue us can be sent  there is just a chance  but that is  all that can be said  we could be married at allahabad  i would make for  that town instead of lucknow if you will go with me  and i could leave  you there in safety till these troubles are over  i am going to take  another horse as well as my own  and two would be as likely to escape as  one       thank you for the offer  captain forster   she said coldly   but i  decline it  my place is here with my uncle and the others       why is it   he asked passionately   if you love me  your place is  surely with me  and you do love me  isobel  do you not  surely i have  not been mistaken      isobel was silent for a moment      you were mistaken  captain forster   she said  after a pause   you paid  me attentions such as i had heard you paid to many others  and it was  pleasant  that you were serious i did not think  i believed you were  simply flirting with me  that you meant no more by it than you had meant  before  and being forewarned  and therefore having no fear that i should  hurt myself more than you would  i entered into it in the same spirit   where there was so much to be anxious about  it was a pleasure and  relief  had i met you elsewhere  and under different circumstances  i  think i should have come to love you  a girl almost without experience  and new to the world  as i am  could hardly have helped doing so   i think  had i thought you were in earnest i should have acted  differently  and if i have deceived you by my manner i am sorry  but  even had i loved you i would not have consented to do the thing you ask  me  you are going on duty  you are going in the hope of obtaining aid  for us  i should be simply escaping while others stay  and i should  despise myself for the action  besides  i do not think that even in that  case my uncle would have consented to my going with you       i am sure that he would   forster broke in   he would never be mad  enough to refuse you the chance of escape from such a fate as may now  await you       we need not discuss the question   she said   even if i loved you  i  would not go with you  and i do not love you       they have prejudiced you against me   he said angrily      they warned me  and they were right in doing so  ask yourself if they  were not  would you see a sister of yours running the risk of breaking  her heart without warning her  do not be angry   she went on  putting  her hand on his arm   we have been good friends  captain forster  and i  like you very much  we may never meet again  it is most likely we never  shall do so  i am grateful to you for the many pleasant hours you have  given me  let us part thus       can you not give some hope that in the distance  when these troubles  are over  should we both be spared  you may        no  captain forster  i am sure it could never be so  if we ever meet  again  we will meet as we part now  as friends  and now i can stay no  longer  they will be missing me   and  turning  she entered the house  before he could speak again     it was some minutes before he followed her  he had not really thought  that she would go with him  perhaps he had hardly wished it  for on  such an expedition a woman would necessarily add to the difficulty and  danger  but he had thought that she would have told him that his love  was returned  and for perhaps the first time in his life he was serious  in his protestation of it      what does it matter   he said at last  as he turned    tis ten thousand  to one against our meeting again  if we do  i can take it up where it  breaks off now  she has acknowledged that she would have liked me if she  had been sure that i was in earnest  next time i shall be so  she was  right  i was but amusing myself with her at first  and had no more  thought of marrying her than i had of flying  but there  it is no use  talking about the future  the thing now is to get out of this trap  i  have felt like a rat in a cage with a terrier watching me for the last  month  and long to be on horseback again  with the chance of making a  fight for my life  what a fool bathurst was to throw away the chance      bathurst  his work done  had looked into the hall where the others were  gathered  and hearing that the doctor was alone on watch had gone up to  him      i was just thinking  bathurst   the doctor said  as he joined him    about that fight today  it seems to me that whatever comes of this  business  you and i are not likely to be among those who go down when  the place is taken       how is that  doctor  why is our chance better than the rest  i have no  hope myself that any will be spared       i put my faith in the juggler  bathurst  has it not struck you that the  first picture you saw has come true       i have never given it a thought for weeks   bathurst said   certainly  i have not thought of it today  yes  now you speak of it  it has come  true  how strange  i put it aside as a clever trick  one that i could  not understand any more than i did the others  but  knowing myself   it seemed beyond the bounds of possibility that it could come true   anything but that i would have believed  but  as i told you  whatever  might happen in the future  i should not be found fighting desperately  as i saw myself doing there  it is true that i did so  but it was only a  sort of a frenzy  i did not fire a shot  as wilson may have told you   i strove like a man in a nightmare to break the spell that seemed to  render me powerless to move  but when  for a moment  the firing ceased   a weight seemed to fall off me  and i was seized with a sort of passion  to kill  i have no distinct remembrance of anything until it was all  over  it was still the nightmare  but one of a different kind  and i  was no more myself then than i was when i was lying helpless on the  sandbags  still  as you say  the picture was complete  at least  if miss  hannay was standing up here       yes  she rose to her feet in the excitement of the fight  i believe we  all did so  the picture was true in all its details as you described it  to me  and that being so  i believe that other picture  the one we saw  together  you and i and isobel hannay in native disguises  will also  come true      bathurst was silent for two or three minutes      it may be so  doctor  heaven only knows  i trust for your sake and hers  it may be so  though i care but little about myself  but that picture  wasn t a final one  and we don t know what may follow it       that is so  bathurst  but i think that you and i  once fairly away in  disguise  might be trusted to make our way down the country  you see   we have a complete confirmation of that juggler s powers  he showed me a  scene in the past  a scene which had not been in my mind for years  and  was certainly not in my thoughts at the time  he showed you a scene in  the future  which  unlikely as it appeared  has actually taken place  i  believe he will be equally right in this other picture  you have heard  that forster is going       yes  wilson came down and told me while i was at work  wilson seemed  rather disgusted at his volunteering  i don t know that i am surprised  myself  for  as i told you  i knew him at school  and he had no moral  courage  though plenty of physical  still  under the circumstances  i  should not have thought he would have gone       you mean because of miss hannay  bathurst       yes  that is what i mean       that sort of thing might weigh with you or me  bathurst  but not with  him  he has loved and ridden away many times before this  but in this  case  fortunately  i don t think he will leave an aching heart behind  him       you don t mean to say  doctor  that you don t think she cares for him       i have not asked her the question   the doctor said dryly   i dare say  she likes him  in fact  i am ready to admit that there has been what you  may call a strong case of flirtation  but when a young woman is  thrown with an uncommonly good looking man  who lays himself out to be  agreeable to her  my experience is that a flirtation generally comes  of it  especially when the young woman has no one else to make herself  agreeable to  and is  moreover  a little sore with the world in general   i own that at one time i was rather inclined to think that out of sheer  perverseness the girl was going to make a fool of herself with that good  looking scamp  but since we have been shut up here i have felt easy in  my mind about it  and now  if you will take my rifle for ten minutes   i will go down and get a cup of tea  i volunteered to take sentry work   but i didn t bargain for keeping it all night without relief  by the  way  i told forster of your offer of your horse  and i think he is going  to take it       he is welcome to it   bathurst said carelessly   it will be of no use  to me       now  look here   the doctor said shortly   just put miss hannay out of  your head for the present  and attend to the business on hand  i do not  think there is much chance of their trying it on again tonight  but they  may do so  so please to keep a sharp lookout while i am below       i will be careful  doctor   bathurst said  with a laugh  but the doctor  had so little faith in his watchfulness that as soon as he went below he  sent up wilson to share his guard     at twelve o clock the sandbags were removed sufficiently to allow a  horse to pass through  and forster s and bathurst s animals were led  out through the breach  their feet having been muffled with blankets to  prevent their striking a stone and arousing the attention of the enemy s  sentinels  once fairly out the mufflings were removed and forster sprang  into his saddle      goodby  major   he said   i hope i may be back again in eight or nine  days with a squadron of cavalry       goodby  forster  i hope it may be so  may god protect you      the gap in the defenses was closed the instant the horses passed  through  and the men stood in the breach of the wall listening as  forster rode off  he went at a walk  but before he had gone fifty paces  there was a sharp challenge  followed almost instantly by a rifle shot   then came the crack of a revolver and the rapid beat of galloping hoofs   loud shouts were heard  and musket shots fired in rapid succession      they are not likely to have hit him in the dark   the major said  as  he climbed back over the sandbags   but they may hit his horses  which  would be just as fatal      leaving two sentries  the one just outside the breach near the wall   the other on the sandbags  the rest of the party hurried up on the  roof  shots were still being fired  and there was a confused sound of  shouting  then a cavalry trumpet rang out sharply  and presently three  shots fired in quick succession came upon the air      that is the signal agreed on   the major said   he is safely beyond  their lines  now it is a question of riding  some of the cavalry will be  in pursuit of him before many minutes are over      forster s adieus had been brief  he had busied himself up to the last  moment in looking to the saddling of the two horses  and had only gone  into the house and said goodby to the ladies just when it was time to  start  he had said a few hopeful words as to the success of the mission   but it had evidently needed an effort for him to do so  he had no  opportunity of speaking a word apart with isobel  and he shook her hand  silently when it came to her turn      i should not have given him credit for so much feeling   mrs  doolan  whispered to isobel  as he went out   he was really sorry to leave us   and i didn t think he was a man to be sorry for anything that didn t  affect himself  i think he had absolutely the grace to feel a little  ashamed of leaving us       i don t think that is fair   isobel said warmly   when he is going away  to fetch assistance for us       he is deserting us as rats desert a sinking ship   mrs  doolan said  positively   and i am only surprised that he has the grace to feel a  little ashamed of the action  as for caring  there is only one person in  the world he cares for  himself  i was reading  david copperfield   just before we came in here  and steerforth s character might have been  sketched from forster  he is a man without either heart or conscience   a man who would sacrifice everything to his own pleasures  and yet even  when one knows him to be what he is  one can hardly help liking him  i  wonder how it is  my dear  that scamps are generally more pleasant than  good men       i never thought about it  mrs  doolan   isobel said  roused to a smile  by the earnestness with which mrs  doolan propounded the problem   and  can give no reason except that we are attracted by natures the reverse  of our own      mrs  doolan laughed      so you think we are better than men  isobel  i don t  not one bit  we  are cramped in our opportunities  but given equal opportunities i don t  think there would be anything to choose between us  but we mustn t stay  talking here any longer  we both go on duty in the sick ward at four  o clock      the enemy s batteries opened on the following morning more violently  than before  more guns had been placed in position during the night  and  a rain of missiles was poured upon the house  for the next six days the  position of the besieged became hourly worse  several breaches had been  made in the wall  and the shots now struck the house  and the inmates  passed the greater part of their time in the basement     the heat was terrible  and  as the firing was kept up night and  day  sleep was almost impossible  the number of the besiegers had  considerably increased  large numbers of the country people taking part  in the siege  while a regiment of sepoys from cawnpore had taken the  place of the detachment of the    d bengal infantry  of whom  indeed   but few now remained     the garrison no longer held the courtyard  several times masses of the  enemy had surged up and poured through the breaches  but a large number  of hand grenades of various sizes had been constructed by the defenders   and the effects of these thrown down from the roof among the crowded  masses were so terrible that the natives each time fell back  the horses  had all been turned out through the breach on the day after captain  forster s departure  in order to save their lives  a plague of flies  was not the least of the defenders  troubles  after the repulse of the  assaults the defenders went out at night and carried the bodies of the  natives who had fallen in the courtyard beyond the wall  nevertheless   the odor of blood attracted such countless swarms of flies that the  ground was black with them  and they pervaded the house in legions     the number of the defenders decreased daily  six only were able now to  carry arms  mr  hunter  captain rintoul  and richards had died of fever   farquharson had been killed by a cannon ball  two civilians had been  badly wounded  several of the children had succumbed  amy hunter had  been killed by a shell that passed through the sandbag protection of the  grating that gave light to the room in the basement used as a sick  ward  the other ladies were all utterly worn out with exhaustion   sleeplessness  and anxiety  still there had been no word spoken of  surrender  had the men been alone they would have sallied out and  died fighting  but this would have left the women at the mercy of the  assailants     the work at the gallery had been discontinued for some time  it had been  carried upwards until a number of roots in the earth showed that they  were near the surface  and  as they believed  under a clump of bushes  growing a hundred and fifty yards beyond the walls  but of late there  had been no talk of using this  flight  which even at first had seemed  almost hopeless  was wholly beyond them in their present weakened  condition     on the last of these six days major hannay was severely wounded  at  night the enemy s fire relaxed a little  and the ladies took advantage  of it to go up onto the terrace for air  while the men gathered for a  council round the major s bed      well  doctor  the end is pretty near   he said   it is clear we cannot  hold out many hours longer  we must look the matter in the face now  we  have agreed all along that when we could no longer resist we would offer  to surrender on the terms that our lives should be spared  and that we  should be given safe conduct down the country  and that if those terms  were refused we were to resist to the end  and then blow up the house  and all in it  i think the time has come for raising the white flag       i think so   the doctor said   we have done everything men could do   i have little hope that they will grant us terms of surrender  for from  the native servants who have deserted us they must have a fair idea of  our condition  what do you think  bathurst       i think it probable there are divisions among them   he replied   the  talookdars may have risen against us  but i do not think they can have  the same deadly enmity the sepoys have shown  they must be heartily sick  of this prolonged siege  and they have lost large numbers of their men   i should say they would be willing enough to give terms  but probably  they are overruled by the sepoys  and perhaps by orders from nana sahib   i know several of them personally  and i think i could influence por  sing  who is certainly the most powerful of the zemindars of this  neighborhood  and is probably looked upon as their natural leader  if  you approve of it  major  i will go out in disguise  and endeavor to  obtain an interview with him  he is an honorable man  and if he will  give his guarantee for our safety  i would trust him  at any rate  i can  but try  if i do not return  you will know that i am dead  and that no  terms can be obtained  and can then decide when to end it all       it is worth the attempt anyhow   the major said   i say nothing about  the danger you will run  for no danger can be greater than that which  hangs over us all now       very well  major  then i will do it at once  but you must not expect me  back until tomorrow night  i can hardly hope to obtain an interview with  por sing tonight       how will you go out  bathurst       i will go down at once and break in the roof of the gallery   he said    we know they are close round the wall  and i could not hope to get out  through any of the breaches       i suppose you are quite convinced that there is no hope of relief from  lucknow       quite convinced  i never had any real hope of it  but had there been a  force disposable  it would have started at once if forster arrived there  with his message  and might have been here by this time       at any rate  we can wait no longer       then we will begin at once   bathurst said  and  taking a crowbar and  pick from the place where the tools were kept  he lighted the lamp and  went along the gallery  accompanied by the doctor  who carried two light  bamboo ladders      do you think you will succeed  bathurst       i am pretty sure of it   he said confidently   i believe i have a  friend there       a friend   the doctor repeated in surprise      yes  i am convinced that the juggler is there  not once  but half a  dozen times during the last two nights when i have been on watch on the  terrace  i have distinctly heard the words whispered in my ear   meet me  at your bungalow   you may think i dozed off and was dreaming  but i  was as wide awake then as i am now  i cannot say that i recognized the  voice  but the words were in the dialect he speaks  at any rate  as soon  as i am out i shall make my way there  and shall wait there all night  on the chance of his coming  after what we know of the man s strange  powers  there seems nothing unreasonable to me in his being able to  impress upon my mind the fact that he wants to see me       i quite agree with you there  and his aid might be invaluable  you are  not the sort of man to have delusions  bathurst  and i quite believe  what you say  i feel more hopeful now than i have done for some time      an hour s hard work  and a hole was made through the soil  which was but  three feet thick  bathurst climbed up the ladder and looked out      it is as we thought  doctor  we are in the middle of that thicket  now  i will go and dress if you will keep guard here with your rifle      at the end of the gallery a figure was standing  it was isobel hannay      i have heard you are going out again  mr  bathurst       yes  i am going to see what i can do in the way of making terms for  us       you may not come back again   she said nervously      that is  of course  possible  miss hannay  but i do not think the risk  is greater than that run by those who stay here       i want to speak to you before you go   she said   i have wanted to  speak so long  but you have never given me an opportunity  we may never  meet again  and i must tell you how sorry i am  how sorry i have been  ever since for what i said  i spoke as a foolish girl  but i know better  now  have i not seen how calm you have been through all our troubles   how you have devoted yourself to us and the children  how you have kept  up all our spirits  how cheerfully you have worked  and as our trouble  increased we have all come to look up to you and lean upon you  do say   mr  bathurst  that you forgive me  and that if you return we can be  friends as we were before       certainly i forgive you if there is anything to forgive  miss hannay    he said gravely   nothing that you or anyone can say can relieve me of  the pain of knowing that i have been unable to take any active part in  your defense  that i have been forced to play the part of a woman rather  than a man  but assuredly  if i return  i shall be glad to be again your  friend  which  indeed  i have never ceased to be at heart      perhaps she expected something more  but it did not come  he spoke  cordially  but yet as one who felt that there was an impassible barrier  between them  she stood irresolute for a moment  and then held out her  hand   goodby  then   she said     he held it a moment   goodby  miss hannay  may god keep you and guard  you      then gently he led her to the door  and they passed out together  a  quarter of an hour later he rejoined the doctor  having brought with him  a few short lengths of bamboo      i will put these across the hole when i get out   he said   lay some  sods over them  and cover them up with leaves  in case anyone should  enter the bushes tomorrow  it is not likely  but it is as well to take  the precaution  one of you had better stay on guard until i come back   it would not do to trust any of the natives  those that remain are all  utterly disheartened and broken down  and might take the opportunity  of purchasing their lives by going out and informing the enemy of the  opening into the gallery  they must already know of its existence from  the men who have deserted  but  fortunately  i don t think any of them  are aware of its exact direction  if they had been  we should have had  them countermining before this      having carefully closed up the opening  bathurst went to the edge of the  bushes and listened  he could hear voices between him and the house   but all was quiet near at hand  and he began to move noiselessly along  through the garden  he had no great fear of meeting with anyone here   the natives had formed a cordon round the wall  and behind that there  would be no one on watch  and as the batteries were silent  all were  doubtless asleep there  in ten minutes he stood before the charred  stumps that marked the site of his bungalow  as he did so  a figure  advanced to meet him      it is you  sahib  i was expecting you  i knew that you would come this  evening       i don t know how you knew it but i am heartily glad to see you       you want to see por sing  come along with me and i will take you to  him  but there is no time to lose   and without another word he walked  rapidly away  followed by bathurst     when they got into the open the latter could see that his companion was  dressed in an altogether different garb to that in which he had before  seen him  being attired as a person of some rank and importance  he  stopped presently for bathurst to come up with him      i have done what i could to prepare the way for you   he said   openly  i could for certain reasons do nothing  but i have said enough to make  him feel uncomfortable about the future  and to render him anxious to  find a way of escape for himself if your people should ever again get  the mastery       how are things going  rujub  we have heard nothing for three weeks  how  is it at cawnpore       cawnpore has been taken by the nana  they surrendered on his solemn  oath that all should be allowed to depart in safety  he broke his oath   and there are not ten of its defenders alive  the women are all in  captivity      bathurst groaned  he had hardly hoped that the handful of defenders  could have maintained themselves against such overpowering numbers  but  the certainty as to their fate was a heavy blow      and lucknow   he asked      the residency holds out at present  but men say that it must soon  fall       and what do you say       i say nothing   the man said   we cannot use our art in matters which  concern ourselves       and delhi       there is a little force of whites in front of delhi  there are tens of  thousands of sepoys in the town  but as yet the whites have maintained  themselves  the chiefs of the punjaub have proved faithless to their  country  and there the british rule is maintained       thank god for that   bathurst exclaimed   as long as the punjaub holds  out the tables may be turned  and the other presidencies       nothing as yet   rujub said  in a tone of discontent      then you are against us  rujub      the man stopped      sahib  i know not what i wish now  i have been brought up to hate the  whites  two of my father s brothers were hung as thugs  and my father  taught me to hate the men who did it  for years i have worked quietly  against you  as have most of those of my craft  we have reason to hate  you  in the old times we were honored in the land  honored and feared   for even the great ones knew that we had powers such as no other men  have  but the whites treat us as if we were mere buffoons  who play  for their amusement  they make no distinction between the wandering  conjurer  with his tricks of dexterity  and the masters  who have powers  that have been handed down from father to son for thousands of years   who can communicate with each other though separated by the length of  india  who can  as you have seen  make men invisible  who can read  the past and the future  they see these things  and though they cannot  explain them  they persist in treating us all as if we were mere  jugglers      they prefer to deny the evidence of their own senses rather than admit  that we have powers such as they have not  and so  even in the eyes of  our own countrymen  we have lost our old standing and position  while  the whites would bribe us with money to divulge the secrets in which  they profess to disbelieve  no wonder that we hate you  and that we  long for the return of the old days  when even princes were glad to ask  favors at our hands  it is seldom that we show our powers now  those who  aid us  and whose servants we are  are not to be insulted by the powers  they bestow upon us being used for the amusement of men who believe in  nothing      the europeans who first came to india have left records of the strange  things they saw at the courts of the native princes  but such things are  no longer done for the amusement of our white masters  thus  then  for  years i have worked against you  and just as i saw that our work was  successful  just as all was prepared for the blow that was to sweep the  white men out of india  you saved my daughter  then my work seemed to  come to an end  would any of my countrymen  armed only with a whip  have  thrown themselves in the way of a tiger to save a woman  a stranger  one  altogether beneath him in rank  one  as it were  dust beneath his feet   that i should be ready to give my life for yours was a matter of course   i should have been an ungrateful wretch otherwise  but this was not  enough  at one blow the work i had devoted myself to for years was  brought to nothing  everything seemed to me new  and as i sat by my  daughter s bedside  when she lay sick with the fever  i had to think it  all out again  then i saw things in another light  i saw that  though  the white men were masterful and often hard  though they had little  regard for our customs  and viewed our beliefs as superstitious   and scoffed at the notion of there being powers of which they had no  knowledge  yet that they were a great people  other conquerors  many  of them  india has had  but none who have made it their first object to  care for the welfare of the people at large  the feringhees have wrung  nothing from the poor to be spent in pomp and display  they permit no  tyranny or ill doing  under them the poorest peasant tills his fields in  peace      i have been obliged to see all this  and i feel now that their  destruction would be a frightful misfortune  we should be ruled by our  native lords  but as soon as the white man was gone the old quarrels  would break out  and the country would be red with blood  i did not see  this before  because i had only looked at it with the eyes of my own  caste  now i see it with the eyes of one whose daughter has been saved  from a tiger by a white man  i cannot love those i have been taught to  hate  but i can see the benefit their rule has given to india      but what can i do now  i am in the stream  and i must go with it  i  know not what i wish or what i would do  six months ago i felt certain   now i doubt  it seemed to me that in a day the english raj would be  swept away  how could it be otherwise when the whole army that had  conquered india for them were against them  i knew they were brave  but  we have never lacked bravery  how could i tell that they would fight one  against a hundred      but come  let us go on  por sing is expecting you  i told him that  i knew that one from the garrison would come out to treat with him  privately tonight  and he is expecting you  though he does not know who  may come      ten minutes walking  and they approached a large tent surrounded by  several smaller ones  a sentry challenged when they approached  but  on rujub giving his name  he at once resumed his walk up and down  and  rujub  followed by bathurst  advanced and entered the tent  the zemindar  was seated on a divan smoking a hookah  rujub bowed  but not with the  deep reverence of one approaching his superior      he is here   he said      then you were not mistaken  rujub       how could i be when i knew   rujub said   i have done what i said  and  have brought him straight to you  that was all i had to do with it  the  rest is for your highness       i would rather that you should be present   por sing said  as rujub  turned to withdraw      no   the latter replied   in this matter it is for you to decide   i know not the nana s wishes  and your highness must take the  responsibility  i have brought him to you rather than to the commander  of the sepoys  because your authority should be the greater  it is you  and the other oude chiefs who have borne the weight of this siege  and  it is only right that it is you who should decide the conditions of  surrender  the sepoys are not our masters  and it is well they are  not so  the nana and the oude chiefs have not taken up arms to free  themselves from the english raj to be ruled over by the men who have  been the servants of the english       that is so   the zemindar said  stroking his beard   well  i will talk  with this person      rujub left the tent   you do not know me  por sing   bathurst said   stepping forward from the entrance where he had hitherto stood   i am  the sahib bathurst       is it so   the zemindar said  laying aside his pipe and rising to his  feet   none could come to me whom i would rather see  you have always  proved yourself a just officer  and i have no complaint against you  we  have often broken bread together  and it has grieved me to know that you  were in yonder house  do you come to me on your own account  or from the  sahib who commands       i come on my own account   bathurst said   when i come as a messenger  from him  i must come openly  i  know you to be an honorable man  and  that i could say what i have to say to you and depart in safety  i  regard you as one who has been misled  and regret for your sake that you  should have been induced to take part with these mutineers against us   believe me  chief  you have been terribly misled  you have been told  that it needed but an effort to overthrow the british raj  those who  told you so lied  it might have seemed easy to destroy the handful of  europeans scattered throughout india  but you have not succeeded in  doing it  even had you done so  you would not have so much as begun  the work  there are but few white soldiers here  why  because england  trusted in the fidelity of her native troops  and thought it necessary  to keep only a handful of soldiers in india  but if need be  for every  soldier now here she could send a hundred  and she will send a hundred  if required to reconquer india  already you may be sure that ships are  on the sea laden with troops  and if you find it so hard to overcome the  few soldiers now here  what would you do against the great armies that  will pour in ere long  why  all the efforts of the sepoys gathered  at delhi are insufficient to defeat the four or five thousand british  troops who hold their posts outside the town  waiting only till the  succor arrives from england to take a terrible vengeance  woe be then  to those who have taken part against us  still more to those whose hands  are stained with british blood       it is too late now   the native said gloomily   the die is cast  but  since i have seen how a score of men could defend that shattered house  against thousands  do you think i have not seen that i have been wrong   who would have thought that men could do such a thing  but it is too  late now       it is not too late   bathurst said   it is too late  indeed  to undo  the mischief that has been done  but not too late for you to secure  yourself against some of the consequences  the english are just  and  when they shall have stamped out this mutiny  as assuredly they will do   they will draw a distinction between mutinous soldiers who were false  to their salt  and native chiefs who fought  as they believed  for the  independence of their country  but one thing they will not forgive   whether in sepoy or in prince  the murder of man  woman  or child in  cold blood  for that there will be no pardon      but it is not upon that ground that i came to appeal to you  but as  a noble of oude  a man who is a brave enemy  but who could never be a  butcher  we have fought against each other fairly and evenly  the time  has come when we can fight no longer  and i demand of you  confidently   that  if we surrender  the lives of all within those walls shall be  respected  and a safe conduct be granted them down the country  i know  that such conditions were granted to the garrison at cawnpore  and that  they were shamelessly violated  for that act nana sahib will never be  forgiven  he will be hunted down like a dog and hung when he is caught   just as if he had been the poorest peasant  but i have not so bad an  opinion of the people of india as to believe them base enough to follow  such an example  and i am confident that if you grant us those terms   you will see that the conditions are observed       i have received orders from nana sahib to send all prisoners down to  him   por sing said  in a hesitating voice      you will never send down prisoners from here   bathurst replied firmly    you may attack us again  and after the loss of the lives of scores more  of your followers you may be successful  but you will take no prisoners   for at the last moment we will blow the house and all in it into the  air  besides  who made nana sahib your master  he is not the lord of  oude  and though doubtless he dreams of sovereignty  it is a rope  not  a throne  that awaits him  why should you nobles of oude obey the orders  of this peasant boy  though he was adopted by the peishwa  the peishwa  himself was never your lord  and why should you obey this traitor  this  butcher  this disgrace to india  when he orders you to hand over to him  the prisoners your sword has made       that is true   por sing said gloomily   but the sepoys will not agree  to the terms       the sepoys are not your masters   bathurst said   we do not surrender  to them  but to you  we place no confidence in their word  but we have  every faith in the honor of the nobles of oude  if you and your friends  grant us the terms we ask  the sepoys may clamor  but they will not  venture to do more  neither they nor nana sahib dare at this moment  affront the people of oude      there are sepoys round lucknow  but it is the men of oude who are  really pressing the siege  if you are firm  they will not dare to break  with you on such a question as the lives of a score of europeans  if you  will give me your word and your honor that all shall be spared  i will  come out in the morning with a flag of truce to treat with you  if not   we will defend ourselves to the last  and then blow ourselves into the  air       and you think   por sing said doubtfully   that if i agreed to this  it  would be taken into consideration should the british raj be restored       i can promise you that it will   bathurst said   it will be properly  represented that it is to you that the defenders of deennugghur  and the  women and children with them  owe their lives  and you may be sure that  this will go a very long way towards wiping out the part you have taken  in the attack on the station  when the day of reckoning comes  the  british government will know as well how to reward those who rendered  them service in these days  as to punish those who have been our foes       i will do it   por sing said firmly   do not come out until the  afternoon  in the morning i will talk with the other zemindars  and  bring them over to agree that there shall be no more bloodshed  there is  not one of us but is heartily sick of this business  and eager to put an  end to it  rujub may report what he likes to the nana  i will do what is  right      after a hearty expression of thanks  bathurst left the tent  rujub was  awaiting him outside      you have succeeded   he asked      yes  he will guarantee the lives of all the garrison  but he seemed to  be afraid of what you might report to nana sahib       i am the nana s agent here   rujub said   i have been working with  him for months  i would i could undo it all now  i was away when they  surrendered at cawnpore  had i not been  that massacre would never have  taken place  for i am one of the few who have influence with him  he is  fully cognizant of my power  and fears it      they made their way back without interruption to the clump of bushes  near the house      when shall i see you again   bathurst asked      i do not know   replied rujub   but be sure that i shall be at hand to  aid you if possible should danger arise          chapter xviii       as soon as bathurst began to remove the covering of the hole  a voice  came from below      is that you  bathurst       all right  doctor       heaven be praised  you are back sooner than i expected  by a long way   i heard voices talking  so i doubted whether it was you       the ladder is still there  i suppose  doctor       yes  it is just as you got off it  what are you going to do about the  hole       rujub is here  he will cover it up after me       then you were right   the doctor said  as bathurst stepped down beside  him   and you found the juggler really waiting for you       at the bungalow  doctor  as i expected       and what have you done  you can hardly have seen por sing  it is not  much over an hour since you left       i have seen him  doctor  and what is more  he has pledged his word for  our safety       thank god for that  lad  it is more than i expected  this will be news  indeed for the poor women  and do you think he will be strong enough to  keep his pledge       i think so  he asked me to wait until tomorrow afternoon before going  out with a flag of truce  and said that by that time he would get the  other zemindars to stand by him  and would make terms whether the sepoys  liked it or not       well  you shall tell us all about it afterwards  bathurst  let us take  the news in to them at once  it is long since they had good tidings  of any kind  it would be cruel to keep them in suspense  even for five  minutes      there was no noisy outburst of joy when the news was told  three weeks  before it would have been received with the liveliest satisfaction  but  now the bitterness of death was well nigh past  half the children lay  in their graves in the garden  scarce one of the ladies but had lost  husband or child  and while women murmured  thank god   as they clasped  their children to them  the tears ran down as they thought how different  it would have been had the news come sooner  the men  although equally  quiet  yet showed more outward satisfaction than the women  warm grasps  of the hands were exchanged by those who had fought side by side  during these terrible days  and a load seemed lifted at once off their  shoulders     bathurst stayed but a moment in the room after this news was told  but  went in with dr  wade to the major  and reported to him in full the  conversation that had taken place between himself and por sing      i think you are right  bathurst  if the oude men hold together  the  sepoys will scarcely risk a breach with them  whether he will be able to  secure our safety afterwards is another thing       i quite see that  major  but it seems to me that we have no option but  to accept his offer and hope for the best       that is it   the doctor agreed   it is certain death if we don t  surrender  there is a chance that he will be able to protect us if we  do  at any rate  we can be no worse off than we are here      isobel had been in with mrs  doolan nursing the sick children when  bathurst arrived  but they presently came out  isobel shook hands with  him without speaking      we are all heavily indebted to you  mr  bathurst   mrs  doolan said    if we escape from this  it will be to you that we humanly owe our  lives      she spoke in a voice that all in the room could hear      your are right  mrs  doolan   the doctor said   and i think that there  are some who must regret now the manner in which they have behaved to  bathurst since this siege began       i do for one   captain doolan said  coming forward      i have regretted it for some time  though i have not had the manliness  to say so  i am heartily sorry  i have done you a great and cruel  injustice  i ought to have known that the doctor  who knew you vastly  better than i did  was not likely to be mistaken  putting that aside   i ought to have seen  and i did see  though i would not acknowledge  it even to myself  that no man has borne himself more calmly and  steadfastly through this siege than you have  and that by twice  venturing out among the enemy you gave proof that you possessed as much  courage as any of us  i do hope that you will give me your hand      all the others who had held aloof from bathurst came forward and  expressed their deep regret for what had occurred     bathurst heard them in silence      i do not feel that there is anything to forgive   he said quietly   i  am glad to hear what you say  and i know you mean it  and i accept  the hands you offer  but what you felt towards me has affected me  but little  for your contempt for me was as nothing to my contempt of  myself  nothing can alter the fact that here  where every man s hand was  wanted to defend the ladies and children  my hand was paralyzed   that whatever i may be at other times  in the hour of battle i  fail hopelessly  nothing that i can do can wipe out  from my own  consciousness  that disgrace       you exaggerate it altogether  bathurst   wilson broke in hotly   it is  nonsense your talking like that  after the way you jumped down into the  middle of them with that mace of yours  it was splendid       more than that  mr  bathurst   mrs  doolan said   i think we women know  what true courage is  and there is not one of us but has  since this  siege began  been helped and strengthened by your calmness  not one but  has reason to be grateful for your kindness to our children during this  terrible time  i won t hear even you speak against yourself       then i will not do so  mrs  doolan   he said  with a grave smile   and  now i will go and sit with the major for a time  things are quieter  tonight than they have been for some time past  and i trust he will get  some sleep      so saying  he quietly left the room      i don t believe he has slept two hours at a time since the siege  began   mrs  doolan said  with tears in her eyes   we have all  suffered  god only knows what we have suffered   but i am sure that he  has suffered more than any of us  as for you men  you may well say you  are sorry and ashamed of your treatment of him  coward  indeed  mr   bathurst may be nervous  but i am sure he has as much courage as anyone  here  come  isobel  you were up all last night  and it s past two  o clock now  we must try to get a little sleep before morning  and i  should advise everyone else off duty to do the same      at daybreak firing commenced  and was kept up energetically all the  morning  at two o clock a white flag was hoisted from the terrace  and  its appearance was greeted with shouts of triumph by the assailants  the  firing at once ceased  and in a few minutes a native officer carrying a  white flag advanced towards the walls      we wish to see the zemindar por sing   bathurst said   to treat with  him upon the subject of our surrender      the officer withdrew  and returned in half an hour saying that he would  conduct the officer in command to the presence of the chief of the  besieging force  captain doolan  therefore  accompanied by bathurst and  dr  wade  went out  they were conducted to the great tent where all  the zemindars and the principal officers of the sepoys were assembled   bathurst acted as spokesman      por sing   he said   and you zemindars of oude  major hannay being  disabled  captain doolan  who is now in command of the garrison   has come to represent him and to offer to surrender to you under the  condition that the lives of all british and natives within the walls be  respected  and that you pledge us your faith and honor that we shall be  permitted to go down the country without molestation  it is to you  por  sing  and you nobles of oude  that we surrender  and not to those who   being sworn soldiers  have mutinied against their officers  and have in  many cases treacherously murdered them  with such men major hannay will  have no dealings  and it is to you that we surrender  major hannay bids  me say that if this offer is refused  we can for a long time prolong our  resistance  we are amply supplied with provisions and munitions of war   and many as are the numbers of our assailants who have fallen already   yet more will die before you obtain possession of the house  more than  that  in no case will we be taken prisoners  for one and all have firmly  resolved to fire the magazine when resistance is no longer possible  and  to bury ourselves and our assailants in the ruins      when bathurst ceased  a hubbub of voices arose  the sepoy officers  protesting that the surrender should be made to them  it was some  minutes before anything like quietness was restored  and then one of the  officers said   here is rujub  he speaks in the name of nana  what does  he say to this      rujub  who was handsomely attired  stepped forward      i have no orders from his highness on this subject   he said   he  certainly said that the prisoners were to be sent to him  but at present  there are no prisoners  nor  if the siege continues  and the english  carry out their threat  will there be any prisoners  i cannot think that  nana sahib would wish to see some hundreds more of his countrymen  slain or blown up  only that he may have these few men and women in his  power       we have come here to take them and kill them   one of the officers said  defiantly   and we will do so      por sing  who had been speaking with the talookdars round him  rose from  his seat      it seems to me that it is for us to decide this matter   he said   it  is upon us that the losses of this siege have fallen  at the order of  nana sahib we collected our retainers  abandoned our homes  and have for  three weeks supported the dangers of this siege  we follow the nana  but  we are not his vassals  nor do we even know what his wishes are in  this matter  but it seems to us that we have done enough and more than  enough  numbers of our retainers and kinsmen have fallen  and to prolong  the siege would cause greater loss  and what should we gain by it  the  possession of a heap of stones  therefore  we are all of opinion that  this offer of surrender should be accepted  we war for the freedom of  our country  and have no thirst for the blood of these english sahibs   still less for that of their wives and children      some of the officers angrily protested  but por sing stood firm  and  the other chiefs were equally determined  seeing this  the officers  consulted together  and the highest in rank then said to the talookdars    we protest against these conditions being given  but since you are  resolved  we stand aside  and are ready to agree for ourselves and our  men to what you may decide       what pledges do you require   por sing asked bathurst      we are content  rajah  with your personal oath that the lives of all  within the house shall be respected  and your undertaking that they  shall be allowed to go unharmed down the country  we have absolute faith  in the honor of the nobles of oude  and can desire no better guarantee       i will give it   por sing said   and all my friends will join me in  it  tonight i will have boats collected on the river  i will furnish you  with an escort of my troops  and will myself accompany you and see you  safely on board  i will then not only give you a safe conduct  praying  all to let you pass unharmed  but my son with ten men shall accompany  you in the boats to inform all that my honor is concerned in your  safety  and that i have given my personal pledge that no molestation  shall be offered to you  i will take my oath  and my friends will do the  same  and i doubt not that the commander of the sepoy troops will join  me in it      bathurst translated what had been said to captain doolan      it is impossible for him to do more than that   he concluded   i do not  think there is the least question as to his good faith       he is a fine old heathen   captain doolan said   tell him that we  accept his terms      bathurst at once signified this  and the rajah then took a solemn oath  to fulfill the conditions of the agreement  the other talookdars  doing the same  and the commander of the sepoys also doing so without  hesitation  por sing then promised that some carts should be collected  before morning  to carry the ladies  the sick and wounded  down to the  river  which was eight miles distant      you can sleep in quiet tonight   he added   i will place a guard of my  own men round the house  and see that none trouble you in any way      a few other points were settled  and then the party returned to the  house  to which they were followed a few minutes later by the son of por  sing and three lads  sons of other zemindars  bathurst went down to meet  them when their approach was noticed by the lookout on the roof      we have come to place ourselves in your hands as hostages  sahib   por  sing s son said   my father thought it likely that the sepoys or  others might make trouble  and he said that if we were in your hands as  hostages  all our people would see that the agreement must be kept  and  would oppose themselves more vigorously to the sepoys       it was thoughtful and kind of your father   bathurst said   as far as  accommodation is concerned  we can do little to make you comfortable   but in other respects we are not badly provided      some of the native servants were at once told off to erect an awning  over a portion of the terrace  tables and couches were placed here  and  bathurst undertook the work of entertaining the visitors     he was glad of the precaution that had been taken in sending them  for  with the glass he could make out that there was much disturbance in  the sepoy lines  men gathering in large groups  with much shouting and  noise  muskets were discharged in the direction of the house  and it was  evident that the mutineers were very discontented with the decision that  had been arrived at     in a short time  however  a body  several hundred strong  of the oude  fighting men moved down and surrounded the house  and when a number of  the sepoys approached with excited and menacing gestures  one of the  zemindars went out to meet them  and bathurst  watching the conference   could see by his pointing to the roof of the house that he was  informing them that hostages had been given to the europeans for the due  observance of the treaty  and doubted not he was telling them that  their lives would be endangered by any movement  then he pointed to the  batteries  as if threatening that if any attack was made the guns would  be turned upon them  at any rate  after a time they moved away  and  gradually the sepoys could be seen returning to their lines     there were but few preparations to be made by the garrison for their  journey  it had been settled that they might take their personal effects  with them  but it was at once agreed to take as little as possible   as there would probably be but little room in the boats  and the fewer  things they carried the less there would be to tempt the cupidity of the  natives      well  bathurst  what do you think of the outlook   the doctor asked   as late in the evening they sat together on some sandbags in a corner of  the terrace      i think that if we get past cawnpore in safety there is not much to  fear  there is no other large place on the river  and the lower we get  down the less likely the natives are to disturb us  knowing  as they are  almost sure to do  that a force is gathering at allahabad       after what you heard of the massacre of the prisoners at cawnpore  whom  the nana and his officers had all sworn to allow to depart in safety   there is little hope that this scoundrel will respect the arrangements  made here       we must pass the place at night  and trust to drifting down  unobserved  the river is wide there  and keeping near the opposite  shore  we may get past in the darkness without being perceived  and even  if they do make us out  the chances are they will not hit us  there are  so few of us that there is no reason why they should trouble greatly  about us       i am sorry to say  bathurst  that i don t like the appearance of the  major s wound  everything has been against him  the heat  the close air   and his anxiety of mind have all told on him  he seems very low  and i  have great doubts whether he will ever see allahabad       i hope you are wrong  doctor  but i thought myself there was a change  for the worse when i saw him an hour ago  there was a drawn look about  his face i did not like  he is a splendid fellow  nothing could have  been kinder than he has been to me  i wish i could change places with  him      the doctor grunted   well  as none of us may see allahabad  bathurst   you need not trouble yourself on that score  i wonder what has become  of your friend the conjurer  i thought he might have been in to see you  this afternoon       i did not expect him   bathurst said   i expect he went as far as he  dared in what he said at the durbar today  probably he is doing all he  can to keep matters quiet  of course he may have gone down to cawnpore  to see nana sahib  but i should think it more probable that he would  remain here until he knows we are safe on board the boats       ah  here is wilson   said the doctor   he is a fine young fellow  and i  am very glad he has gone through it safely       so am i   bathurst said warmly   here we are  wilson       i thought i would find you both smoking here   wilson said  as he  seated himself   it is awfully hot below  and the ladies are all at  work picking out the things they are going to take with them and packing  them  and as i could not be of any use at that  i thought i would come  up for a little fresh air  if one can call it fresh  but  in fact  i  would rather sit over an open drain  for the stench is horrible  how  quiet everything seems tonight  after crouching here for the last three  weeks listening to the boom of their cannon and the rush of their balls  overhead  or the crash as they hit something  it seems quite unnatural   one can t help thinking that something is going to happen  i don t  believe i shall be able to sleep a wink tonight  while generally  in  spite of the row  it has been as much as i could do to keep my eyes  open  i suppose i shall get accustomed to it in time  at present it  seems too unnatural to enjoy it       you had better get a good night s sleep  if you can  wilson   the  doctor said   there won t be much sleep for us in the boats till we see  the walls of allahabad       i suppose not  doctor  i expect we shall be horribly cramped up  i long  to be there  i hope to get attached to one of the regiments coming up   so as to help in giving the thrashing to these scoundrels that they  deserve  i would give a year s pay to get that villain  nana sahib   within reach of my sword  it is awful to think of the news you brought  in  bathurst  and that there are hundreds of women and children in his  power now  what a day it will be when we march into cawnpore       don t count your chickens too soon  wilson   the doctor said   the time  i am looking forward to is when we shall have safely passed cawnpore on  our way down  that is quite enough for me to hope for at present       yes  i was thinking of that myself   wilson replied   if the nana  could not be bound by the oath he had taken himself  he is not likely to  respect the agreement made here       we must pass the place at night   bathurst said   and trust to not  being seen  even if they do make us out  we shan t be under fire long  unless they follow us down the bank  but if the night is dark  they may  not make us out at all  fortunately there is no moon  and boats are  not very large marks even by daylight  and at night it would only be a  chance shot that would hit us       yes  we should be as difficult to hit as a tiger   the doctor put in     wilson laughed      i have gained a lot of experience since then  doctor  what ages that  seems back  years almost       it does indeed   the doctor agreed   we count time by incidents and not  by days  well  i think i shall turn in   are you coming  bathurst       no  i could not sleep   bathurst said   i shall watch till morning  i  feel sure it is all safe  but the mutineers might attempt something      the night  however  passed off quietly  and soon after daybreak eight  bullock carts were seen approaching  with a strong body of oude men   half an hour later the luggage was packed  and the sick and wounded laid  on straw in the wagons  several of the ladies took their places with  them  but mrs  doolan  isobel  and mary hunter said they would walk for  a while  it had been arranged that the men might carry out their arms  with them  and each of the ten able to walk took their rifles  while  all  even the women  had pistols about them  just as they were ready   por sing and several of the zemindars rode up on horseback      we shall see you to the boats   he said   have you taken provisions for  your voyage  it would be better not to stop to buy anything on the way      this precaution had been taken  and as soon as all was ready they set  out  guarded by four hundred oude matchlock men  the sepoys had gathered  near the house  and as soon as they left it there was a rush made to  secure the plunder      i should have liked to have emptied the contents of some of my bottles  into the wine   the doctor growled   it would not have been strictly  professional  perhaps  but it would have been a good action       i am sure you would not have given them poison  doctor   wilson  laughed   but a reasonable dose of ipecacuanha might hardly have gone  against your conscience       my conscience has nothing to do with it   the doctor said   these  fellows came from cawnpore  and i have no doubt took part in the  massacre there  my conscience wouldn t have troubled me if i could  have poisoned the whole of the scoundrels  or put a slow match in  the magazine and blown them all into the air  but under the present  conditions it would hardly have been politic  as one couldn t be sure of  annihilating the whole of them  well  miss hannay  what are you thinking  of       i am thinking that my uncle looks worse this morning  doctor  does it  not strike you so too       we must hope that the fresh air will do him good  one could not expect  anyone to get better in that place  it was enough to kill a healthy man   to say nothing of a sick one      isobel was walking by the side of the cart in which her uncle was lying   and it was not long before she took her place beside him     the doctor shook his head      can you do nothing  doctor   bathurst said  in a low tone      nothing  he is weaker this morning  still the change of air may help  him  and he may have strength to fight through  the wound itself is a  serious one  but he would under other circumstances have got over it   as it is  i think his chance a very poor one  though i would not say as  much to her      after three hours  travel they reached the river  here two large native  boats were lying by the bank  the baggage and sick were soon placed  on board  and the europeans with the native servants were then divided  between them  and the rajah s son and six of the retainers took their  places in one of the boats  the doctor and captain doolan had settled  how the party should be divided  the major and the other sick men were  all placed in one boat  and in this were the doctor  bathurst  and four  civilians  with isobel hannay  mrs  hunter  and her daughter  captain  doolan  his wife  mrs  rintoul  and the other three ladies  with the six  children who had alone survived  and the rest of the party  were in the  other boat     por sing and his companions were thanked heartily for the protection  they had given  and bathurst handed them a document which had been  signed by all the party  testifying to the service they had rendered      if we don t get down to allahabad   bathurst said  as he handed it to  him   this will insure you good treatment when the british troops come  up  if we get there  we will represent your conduct in such a light that  i think i can promise you that the part you took in the siege will be  forgiven      then the boats pushed off and started on their way down the stream     the distance by water to cawnpore was over forty miles  it was already  eleven o clock  and slow progress only could be made with the heavy  boats  but it was thought that they would be able to pass the town  before daylight began to break next morning  and they therefore pushed  on as rapidly as they could  the boatmen being encouraged to use their  utmost efforts by the promise of a large reward upon their arrival at  allahabad     there was but little talk in the boats  now that the strain was over   all felt its effects severely  the doctor attended to his patients   isobel sat by the side of her uncle  giving him some broth that they had  brought with them  from time to time  or moistening his lips with weak  brandy and water  he spoke only occasionally      i don t much think i shall get down to allahabad  isobel   he said   if  i don t  go down to calcutta  and go straight to jamieson and son  they  are my agents  and they will supply you with money to take you home   they have a copy of my will  my agents in london have another copy  i  had two made in case of accident       oh  uncle  you will get better now you are out of that terrible place       i am afraid it is too late  my dear  though i should like to live for  your sake  but i think i see happiness before you  if you choose to  take it  he is a noble fellow  isobel  in spite of that unfortunate  weakness      isobel made no answer  but a slight pressure of the hand she was holding  showed that she understood what he meant  it was no use to tell her  uncle that she felt that what might have been was over now  bathurst had  chatted with her several times the evening before and during the march  that morning  but she felt the difference between his tone and that in  which he had addressed her in the old times before the troubles began   it was a subtle difference that she could hardly have explained even  to herself  but she knew that it was as a friend  and as a friend only   that he would treat her in the future  and that the past was a closed  book  which he was determined not to reopen     bathurst talked to mrs  hunter and her daughter  both of whom were mere  shadows  worn out with grief  anxiety  and watching  at times he went  forward to talk to the young noble  who had taken his seat there  both  boats had been arched in with a canopy of boughs to serve alike as a  protection from the sun and to screen those within from the sight of  natives in boats or on the banks      you don t look yourself  bathurst   the doctor said to him late in the  afternoon   everything seems going on well  no boats have passed us  and  the boatmen all say that we shall pass cawnpore about one o clock  at  the rate at which we are going       i feel nervous  doctor  more anxious than i have been ever since this  began  there is an apprehension of danger weighing over me that i can t  account for  as you say  everything seems going on well  and yet i feel  that it is not so  i am afraid i am getting superstitious  but i feel  as if rujub knows of some danger impending  and that he is somehow  conveying that impression to me  i know that there is nothing to be  done  and that we are doing the only thing that we can do  unless we  were to land and try and make our way down on foot  which would be sheer  madness  that the man can in some way impress my mind at a distance  is evident from that summons he gave me to meet him at the ruins of my  bungalow  but i do not feel the same clear distinct perception of  his wishes now as i did then  perhaps he himself is not aware of the  particulars of the danger that threatens  or  knowing them  he can see  no way of escape out of them  it may be that at night  when everything  is quiet  one s mind is more open to such impressions than it is when we  are surrounded by other people and have other things to think of  but i  feel an actual consciousness of danger       i don t think there can be any danger until we get down near cawnpore   they may possibly be on the lookout for us there  and may even have  boats out on the stream  it is possible that the sepoys may have sent  down word yesterday afternoon to nana sahib that we had surrendered  and  should be starting by boat this morning  but i don t think there can  be any danger till we get there  should we meet native boats and be  stopped  por sing s son will be able to induce them to let us pass   certainly none of the villagers about here would be likely to disobey  him  once beyond cawnpore  i believe that he would have sufficient  influence  speaking  as he does  in the name  not only of his father   but of other powerful landowners  to induce any of these oude people to  let us pass  no  i regard cawnpore as our one danger  and i believe it  to be a very real one  i have been thinking  indeed  that it would be a  good thing when we get within a couple of miles of the place for all who  are able to walk  to land on the opposite bank  and make their way along  past cawnpore  and take to the boats again a mile below the town       that would be an excellent plan  doctor  but if the boats were stopped  and they found the sick  they would kill them to a certainty  i don t  think we could leave them  i am quite sure miss hannay would not leave  her uncle       i think we might get over even that  bathurst  there are only the major  and the other two men  and mrs  forsyth and three children  too ill to  walk  there are eight of the native servants  ourselves  and the young  rajah s retainers  we ought to have no difficulty in carrying the  wounded  as to the luggage  that must be sacrificed  so that the boatmen  can go down with empty benches  it must be pitched overboard  the loss  would be of no real consequence  everyone could manage with what they  have on until we get to allahabad  there would be no difficulty in  getting what we require there       i think the plan is an excellent one  doctor  i will ask the young  chief if his men will help us to carry the sick  if he says yes  we will  go alongside the other boat and explain our plan to doolan      the young rajah at once assented  and the boat being rowed up to the  other  the plan was explained and approved of  no objection was raised  by anyone  even to the proposal for getting rid of all the luggage   and as soon as the matter was arranged  a general disposition towards  cheerfulness was manifested  everyone had felt that the danger of  passing cawnpore would be immense  and this plan for avoiding it seemed  to lift a load from their minds     it was settled they should land at some spot where the river was  bordered by bushes and young trees  that stout poles should be cut  and  blankets fastened between them  so as to form stretchers on which the  sick could be carried     as far as possible the boats were kept on the left side of the river   but at times shallows rendered it necessary to keep over by the right  bank  whenever they were near the shore  silence was observed  lest the  foreign tongue should be noticed by anyone near the bank     night fell  and they still continued their course  an hour after sunset  they were rowing near the right bank  the major had fallen into a sort  of doze  and isobel was sitting next to bathurst  and they were talking  in low tones together  when suddenly there was a hail from the shore   not fifty yards away      what boats are those       fishing boats going down the river   one of the boatmen answered      row alongside  we must examine you      there was a moment s pause  and then the doctor said in the native  language   row on  men   and the oars of both boats again dipped into  the water      we are pressed for time   the young zemindar shouted  and then   dropping his voice  urged the men to row at the top of their speed      stop  or we fire   came from the shore     no answer was returned from the boats  they were now nearly opposite the  speaker  then came the word   fire   six cannon loaded with grape were  discharged  and a crackle of musketry at the same moment broke out  the  shot tore through the boats  killing and disabling many  and bringing  down the arbor of boughs upon them     a terrible cry arose  and all was confusion  most of the rowers were  killed  and the boats drifted helplessly amid the storm of rifle  bullets     as the cannon flashed out and the grape swept the boats bathurst  with  a sharp cry  sprang to his feet  and leaped overboard  as did several  others from both boats  diving  he kept under water for some distance   and then swam desperately till he reached shallow water on the other  side of the river  and then fell head foremost on the sand  eight or  ten others also gained the shore in a body  and were running towards the  bank  when the guns were again fired  and all but three were swept away  by the iron hail  a few straggling musket shots were fired  then orders  were shouted  and the splashing of an oar was heard  as one of the  native boatmen rowed one of the two boats toward the shore  bathurst  rose to his feet and ran  stumbling like a drunken man  towards the  bushes  and just as he reached them  fell heavily forward  and lay there  insensible  three men came out from the jungle and dragged him in  as  they did so loud screams arose from the other bank  then half a dozen  muskets were fired  and all was quiet     it was not for a quarter of an hour that bathurst was conscious of what  was going on around him  someone was rubbing his chest and hands      who is it   he asked      oh  it is you  bathurst   he heard wilson s voice exclaim   i thought  it was you  but it is so dark now we are off that white sand that i  could not see  where are you hit       i don t know   bathurst said   i felt a sort of shock as i got out of  the water  but i don t know that i am hurt at all       oh  you must be hit somewhere  try and move your arms and legs      bathurst moved      no  i don t think i am hit  if i am  it is on the head  i feel  something warm round the back of my neck       by jove  yes   wilson said   here is where it is  there is a cut all  along the top of your head  the bullet seems to have hit you at the  back  and gone right along over the top  it can t have gone in  or else  you would not be able to talk       help me up   bathurst said  and he was soon on his feet  he felt giddy  and confused   who have you with you   he asked      two natives  i think one is the young chief  and the other is one of  his followers      bathurst spoke to them in their native language  and found that wilson  was not mistaken  as soon as he found that he was understood  the young  chief poured out a volley of curses upon those who had attacked them     bathurst stopped him   we shall have time for that afterwards  murad    he said   the first thing is to see what had best be done  what has  happened since i landed  wilson       our boat was pretty nearly cut in two   wilson said   and was sinking  when i jumped over  the other boat has been rowed ashore       what did you hear  wilson       i heard the women scream   wilson said reluctantly   and five or six  shots were fired  there has been no sound since then      bathurst stood silent for a minute      i do not think they will have killed the women   he said   they did not  do so at cawnpore  they will take them there  no doubt they killed the  men  let me think for a moment  now   he said after a long pause   we  must be doing  murad  your father and friends have given their word for  the safety of those you took prisoners  that they have been massacred  is no fault of your father or of you  this gentleman and myself are the  only ones saved  as far as we know  are you sure that none others came  ashore       the others were all killed  we alone remaining   murad said   i will go  back to my father  and he will go to cawnpore and demand vengeance       you can do that afterwards  murad  the first thing is to fulfill  your promise  and i charge you to take this sahib in safety down to  allahabad  you must push on at once  for they may be sending out from  cawnpore at daylight to search the bushes here to see if any have  escaped  you must go on with him tonight as far as you can  and in the  morning enter some village  buy native clothes  and disguise him  and  then journey on to allahabad       i will do that   the young rajah said   but what about yourself       i shall go into cawnpore and try to rescue any they may have taken   i have a native cloth round me under my other clothes  as i thought it  might be necessary for me to land before we got to cawnpore to see if  danger threatened us  so i have everything i want for a disguise about  me       what are you saying  bathurst   wilson asked      i am arranging for murad and his follower to take you down to  allahabad  wilson  i shall stop at cawnpore       stop at cawnpore  are you mad  bathurst       no  i am not mad  i shall stop to see if any of the ladies have been  taken prisoners  and if so  try to rescue them  rujub  the juggler  is  there  and i am confident he will help me       but if you can stay  i can  bathurst  if miss hannay has been made  prisoner  i would willingly be killed to rescue her       i know you would  wilson  but you would be killed without being able to  rescue her  and as i should share your fate  you would render her rescue  impossible  i can speak the native language perfectly  and know native  ways  i can move about among them without fear of exciting their  suspicion  if you were with me this would be impossible  the first time  you were addressed by a native you would be detected  your presence  would add to my difficulties a hundredfold  it is not now a question of  fighting  were it only that  i should be delighted to have you with me   as it is  the thing is impossible  if anything is done  i must do it  alone  if i ever reach miss hannay  she shall know that you were ready  to run all risks to save her  no  no  you must go on to allahabad  and  if you cannot save her now  you will be with the force that will save  her  if i should fail to do so  and which will avenge us both if it  should arrive too late to rescue her  now i must get you to bandage my  head  for i feel faint with loss of blood  i will take off my shirt and  tear it in strips  i have got a native disguise next to the skin  we may  as well leave my clothes behind me here      as soon as wilson  with the assistance of murad  had bandaged the wound   the party struck off from the river  and after four hours  walking came  down upon it again two miles below cawnpore  here bathurst said he would  stop  stain his skin  and complete his disguise      i hate leaving you   wilson said  in a broken voice   there are only  you and i left of all our party at deennugghur  it is awful to think  they have all gone  the good old chief  the doctor  and richards  and  the ladies  there are only we two left  it does seem such a dirty   cowardly thing for me to be making off and leaving you here alone       it is not cowardly  wilson  for i know you would willingly stay if you  could be of the slightest use  but  as  on the contrary  you would only  add to the danger  it must be as i have arranged  goodby  lad  don t  stay  it has to be done  god bless you  goodby  murad  tell your father  when you see him that i know no shadow of broken faith rests on him      so saying  he turned and went into a clump of bushes  while wilson   too overpowered to speak  started on his way down country with the two  natives         chapter xix       now alone  bathurst threw himself down among the bashes in an attitude  of utter depression      why wasn t i killed with the others   he groaned   why was i not killed  when i sat there by her side      so he lay for an hour  and then slowly rose and looked round  there was  a faint light in the sky      it will be light in another hour   he said to himself  and he again sat  down  suddenly he started  had someone spoken  or had he fancied it      wait till i come      he seemed to hear the words plainly  just as he had heard rujub s  summons before      that s it  it is rujub  how is it that he can make me hear in this way   i am sure it was his voice  anyhow  i will wait  it shows he is thinking  of me  and i am sure he will help me  i know well enough i could do  nothing by myself      bathurst assumed with unquestioning faith that isobel hannay was alive   he had no reason for his confidence  that first shower of grape might  have killed her as it killed others  but he would not admit the doubt  in his mind  wilson s description of what had happened while he was  insensible was one of the grounds of this confidence     he had heard women scream  mrs  hunter and her daughter were the only  other women in the boat  isobel would not have screamed had those  muskets been pointed at her  nor did he think the others would have done  so  they screamed when they saw the natives about to murder those who  were with them  the three women were sitting together  and if one had  fallen by the grape shot all would probably have been killed  he felt  confident  therefore  that she had escaped  he believed he would have  known it had she been killed      if i can be influenced by this juggler  surely i should have felt it  had isobel died   he argued  and was satisfied that she was still alive     what  however  more than anything else gave him hope was the picture  on the smoke   everything else has come true   he said to himself   why  should not that  wilson spoke of the doctor as dead  i will not believe  it  for if he is dead  the picture is false  why should that thing of  all others have been shown to me unless it had been true  what seemed  impossible to me  that i should be fighting like a brave man  has  been verified  why should not this  i should have laughed at such  superstition six months ago  now i cling to it as my one ground for  hope  well  i will wait if i have to stay here until tomorrow night      noiselessly he moved about in the little wood  going to the edge and  looking out  pacing to and fro with quick steps  his face set in  a frown  occasionally muttering to himself  he was in a fever of  impatience  he longed to be doing something  even if that something led  to his detention and death  he said to himself that he should not care  so that isobel hannay did but know that he had died in trying to rescue  her     the sun rose  and he saw the peasants in the fields  and caught the note  of a bugle sounding from the lines at cawnpore  at last  it had seemed  to him an age  but the sun had been up only an hour  he saw a figure  coming along the river bank  as it approached he told himself that it  was the juggler  if so  he had laid aside the garments in which he last  saw him  and was now attired as when they first met  when he saw him  turn off from the river bank and advance straight towards the wood  he  had no doubt that it was the man he expected      thanks be to the holy ones that you have escaped  sahib   rujub said   as soon as he came within speaking distance of bathurst   i was in  an agony last night  i was with you in thought  and saw the boats  approaching the ambuscade  i saw you leap over and swim to shore  i saw  you fall  and i cried out  for a moment i thought you were killed  then  i saw you go on and fall again  and saw your friends carry you in  i  watched you recover and come on here  and then i willed it that you  should wait here till i came for you  i have brought you a disguise  for  i did not know that you had one with you  but  first of all  sit down  and let me dress your wound afresh  i have brought all that is necessary  for it       you are a true fried  rujub  i relied upon you for aid  do you know why  i waited here instead of going down with the others       i know  sahib  i can tell your thoughts as easily when you are away  from me as i can when we are together       can you do this with all people       no  my lord  to be able to read another s thoughts it is necessary  there should be a mystic relation established between them  as i walked  beside your horse when you carried my daughter before you after saving  her life  i felt that this relation had commenced  and that henceforward  our fates were connected  it was necessary that you should have  confidence in me  and it was for that reason that i showed you some of  the feats that we rarely exhibit  and proved to you that i possessed  powers with which you were unacquainted  but in thought reading my  daughter has greater powers than i have  and it was she who last night  followed you on your journey  sitting with her hand in mine  so that my  mind followed hers       do you know all that happened last night  rujub   bathurst said   summoning up courage to ask the question that had been on his lips from  the first      i only know  my lord  that the party was destroyed  save three white  women  who were brought in just as the sun rose this morning  one  was the lady behind whose chair you stood the night i performed at  deennugghur  the lady about whom you are thinking  i do not know the  other two  one was getting on in life  the other was a young one      the relief was so great that bathurst turned away  unable for a while to  continue the conversation  when he resumed the talk  he asked   did you  see them yourself  rujub       i saw them  sahib  they were brought in on a gun carriage       how did they look  rujub       the old one looked calm and sad  she did not seem to hear the shouts of  the budmashes as they passed along  she held the young one close to  her  that one seemed worn out with grief and terror  your memsahib sat  upright  she was very pale and changed from the time i saw her that  evening  but she held her head high  and looked almost scornfully at the  men who shook their fists and cried at her       and they put them with the other women that they have taken prisoners      rujub hesitated      they have put the other two there  sahib  but her they took to  bithoor      bathurst started  and an exclamation of horror and rage burst from him      to the rajah s   he exclaimed   to that scoundrel  come  let us go  why  are we staying here       we can do nothing for the moment  before i started i sent off my  daughter to bithoor  she knows many there  and will find out what is  being done and bring us word  for i dare not show myself there  the  rajah is furious with me because i did not support the sepoys  and  suffered conditions to be made with your people  but now that all has  turned out as he wished  i will in a short time present myself before  him again  but for the moment it was better that my daughter should go   as i had to come to you  but first you had better put on the disguise i  have brought you  you are too big and strong to pass without notice in  that peasant s dress  the one i have brought you is such as is worn  by the rough people  the budmashes of cawnpore  i can procure others  afterwards when we see what had best be done  it will be easy enough to  enter bithoor  for all is confusion there  and men come and go as they  choose  but it will be well nigh impossible for you to penetrate where  the memsahib will be placed  even for me  known as i am to all the  rajah s officers  it would be impossible to do so  it is my daughter in  whom we shall have to trust      bathurst rapidly put on the clothes that rujub had brought with him  and  thrust a sword  two daggers  and a brace of long barreled pistols into  the sash round his waist      your color is not dark enough  sahib  i have brought dye with me  but  first i must dress the wound on your head  and bandage it more neatly   so that the blood stained swathings will not show below the folds of  your turban      bathurst submitted himself impatiently to rujub s hands  the latter cut  off all the hair that would show under the turban  dyed the skin  the same color as the other parts  and finally  after darkening his  eyebrows  eyelashes  and mustache  pronounced that he would pass  anywhere without attracting attention  then they started at a quick walk  along the river  crossed by the ferryboat to cawnpore  and made their  way to a quiet street in the native town      this is my house for the present   rujub said  producing a key and  unlocking a door  he shouted as he closed the door behind him  and an  old woman appeared      is the meal prepared   he asked      it is ready   she said      that is right  tell rhuman to put the pony into the cart      he then led the way into a comfortably furnished apartment where a meal  was laid      eat  my lord   he said   you need it  and will require your strength      bathurst  who  during his walk  had felt the effects of the loss of  blood and anxiety  at once seated himself at the table and ate  at first  languidly  but as appetite came  more heartily  and felt still more  benefited by a bottle of excellent wine rujub had placed beside him  the  latter returned to the room just as he had finished  he was now attired  as he had been when bathurst last met him at deennugghur      i feel another man  rujub  and fit for anything       the cart is ready   rujub said   i have already taken my meal  we do  not eat meat  and live entirely on vegetables  meat clouds the senses   and simple food  and little of it  is necessary for those who would  enter the inner brotherhood      at the door a small native cart was standing with a pony in the shafts      you will go with us  rhuman   rujub said  as he and bathurst took their  seats in the cart     the boy squatted down at rujub s feet  taking the reins and whip  and  the pony started off at a brisk pace  upon the way rujub talked of  various matters  of the reports of the force that was gathering at  allahabad  and the madness of the british in supposing that two or three  thousand men could withstand the forces of the nana      they would be eaten up   he said   the troops will go out to meet them   they will never arrive within sight of cawnpore      as bathurst saw that he was talking for the boy to hear  rather than to  himself  he agreed loudly with all that he said  and boasted that even  without the nana s troops and the sepoys  the people of cawnpore could  cut the english dogs to pieces     the drive was not a long one  and the road was full of parties going  to or returning from bithoor  groups of sepoy officers  parties of  budmashes from cawnpore  mounted messengers  landowners with their  retainers  and others  arriving within a quarter of a mile of the  palace  rujub ordered the boy to draw aside      take the horse down that road   he said   and wait there until we  return  we may be some time  if we are not back by the time the sun  sets  you will return home      as they approached the palace bathurst scanned every window  as if he  hoped to see isobel s face at one of them  entering the garden  they  avoided the terrace in front of the house  and sauntering through the  groups of people who had gathered discussing the latest news  they took  their seat in a secluded corner     bathurst thought of the last time he had been there  when there had been  a fete given by the rajah to the residents of cawnpore  and contrasted  the present with the past  then the gardens were lighted up  and a crowd  of officers and civilians with ladies in white dresses had strolled  along the terrace to the sound of gay music  while their host moved  about among them  courteous  pleasant  and smiling  now the greater  portion of the men were dead  the women were prisoners in the hands of  the native who had professed such friendship for them      tell me  rujub   he said presently   more about this force at  allahabad  what is its strength likely to be       they say there is one british regiment of the line  one of the plumed  regiments with bare legs  and one of the white madras regiments  they  have a few guns  a very few horsemen  that is all  while there are  twenty thousand troops here  how can they hope to win       you will see they will win   bathurst said sternly   they have often  fought well  but they will fight now as they never fought before  every  man will feel himself an avenger of the foul treachery and the brutal  massacres that have been committed  were it but one regiment that is  coming up instead of three  i would back it against the blood stained  wretches       they are fighting for freedom   rujub said      they are fighting for nothing of the sort   bathurst replied hotly    they are fighting for they know not what  change of masters  for  license to plunder  and because they are ignorant and have been led  away  i doubt not that at present  confident as they may be of victory   most of them in their hearts regret what they have done  they have  forfeited their pensions  they have thrown away the benefits of their  years of service  they have been faithless to their salt  and false  to their oaths  it is true that they know they are fighting with ropes  round their necks  but even that won t avail against the discipline and  the fury of our troops  i feel as certain  rujub  that  in spite of the  odds against them  the english will triumph  as if i saw their column  marching into the town  i don t profess to see the future as you do  but  i know enough to tell you that ere long that palace you can see through  the trees will be leveled to the ground  that it is as assuredly doomed  as if fire had already been applied to its gilded beams      rujub nodded   i know the palace is doomed  while i have looked at it  it has seemed hidden by a cloud of smoke  but i did not think it was the  work of the british  i thought of an accident       the rajah may fire it with his own hands   bathurst said   but if he  does not  it will be done for him       i have not told you yet  sahib   rujub said  changing the subject   how  it was that i could neither prevent the attack on the boats nor warn you  that it was coming  i knew at deennugghur that news had been sent of  the surrender to the nana  i remained till i knew you were safely in the  boats  and then rode to cawnpore  my daughter was at the house when  i arrived  and told me that the nana was furious with me  and that it  would not be safe for me to go near the palace  thus  although i feared  that an attack was intended  i thought it would not be until the boats  passed the town  it was late before i learnt that a battery of artillery  and some infantry had set out that afternoon  then i tried to warn you   but i felt that i failed  you were not in a mood when my mind could  communicate itself to yours       i felt very uneasy and restless   bathurst said   but i had not  the same feeling that you were speaking to me i had that night at  deennugghur  but even had i known of the danger  there would have been  no avoiding it  had we landed  we must have been overtaken  and it would  have come to the same thing  tell me  rujub  had you any idea when i saw  you at deennugghur that if we were taken prisoners miss hannay was to be  brought here instead of being placed with the other ladies       yes  i knew it  sahib  the orders he gave to the sepoys were that every  man was to be killed  and that the women and children were to be taken  to cawnpore  except miss hannay  who was to be carried here at once  the  rajah had noticed her more than once when she was at cawnpore  and had  made up his mind that she should go to his zenana       why did you not tell me when you were at deennugghur       what would have been the use  sahib  i hoped to save you all  besides   it was not until we saw her taken past this morning that we knew that  the miss hannay who was to be taken to bithoor was the lady whom my  daughter  when she saw her with you that night  said at once that you  loved  but had we known it  what good would it have done to have told  you of the rajah s orders  you could not have done more than you have  done  but now we know  we will aid you to save her       how long will your daughter be before she comes  it is horrible waiting  here       you must have patience  sahib  it will be no easy work to get the lady  away  there will be guards and women to look after her  a lady is not to  be stolen out of a zenana as a young bird is taken from its nest       it is all very well to say  be patient    bathurst said  getting up and  walking up and down with quick angry strides   it is maddening to sit  here doing nothing  if it were not that i had confidence in your power  and will to aid me  i would go into the palace and stab nana sahib to  the heart  though i were cut to pieces for it the moment afterwards       that would do no good to the lady  sahib   rujub said calmly   she  would only be left without a friend  and the nana s death might be  the signal for the murder of every white prisoner  ah  here comes my  daughter      rabda came up quickly  and stopped before bathurst with her head bowed  and her arms crossed in an attitude of humility  she was dressed in the  attire worn by the principal servants in attendance upon the zenana of a  hindoo prince      well  what news  rabda   bathurst asked eagerly      the light of my lord s heart is sick  she bore up till she arrived here  and was handed over to the women  then her strength failed her  and she  fainted  she recovered  but she is lying weak and exhausted with all  that she has gone through and suffered       where is she now       she is in the zenana  looking out into the women s court  that no men  are ever allowed to enter       has the rajah seen her       no  sahib  he was told the state that she was in  and the chief lady  of the zenana sent him word that for the present she must have quiet and  rest  but that in two or three days she might be fit to see him       that is something   bathurst said thankfully   now we shall have time  to think of some scheme for getting her out       you have been in the zenana yourself  rabda   rujub asked      yes  father  the mistress of the zenana saw me directly an attendant  told her i was there  she has always been kind to me  i said that you  were going on a journey  and asked her if i might stay with her and act  as an attendant until you returned  and she at once assented  she asked  if i should see you before you left  and when i said yes  she asked if  you could not give her some spell that would turn the rajah s thoughts  from this white girl  she fears that if she should become first favorite  in the zenana  she might take things in her hands as english women do   and make all sorts of changes  i told her that  doubtless  the english  girl would do this  and that i thought she was wise to ask your  assistance       you are mad  rabda   her father said angrily   what have i to do with  spells and love philters       no  father  i knew well enough you would not believe in such things   but i thought in this way i might see the lady  and communicate with  her       a very good idea  rabda   bathurst said   is there nothing you can do   rujub  to make her odious to the nana       nothing  sahib  i could act upon some people s minds  and make them  think that the young lady was afflicted by some loathsome disease  but  not with the nana  i have many times tried to influence him  but without  success  his mind is too deep for mine to master  and between us there  is no sympathy  could i be present with him and the girl i might do  something  that is  if the powers that aid me would act against him  but  this i do not think       rujub   bathurst said suddenly   there must have been medical stores  taken when the camp was captured  drugs and things of that sort  can you  find out who has become possessed of them       i might find out  sahib  doubtless the men who looted the camp will  have sold the drugs to the native shops  for english drugs are highly  prized  are there medicines that can act as the mistress of the zenana  wishes       no  but there are drugs that when applied externally would give the  appearance of a terrible disease  there are acids whose touch would burn  and blister the skin  and turn a beautiful face into a dreadful mask       but would it recover its fairness  sahib       the traces might last for a long time  even for life  if too much were  used  but i am sure miss hannay would not hesitate for a moment on that  account       but you  sahib  would you risk her being disfigured       what does it matter to me   bathurst asked sternly   do you think love  is skin deep  and that  tis only for a fair complexion that we choose  our wives  find me the drugs  and let rabda take them into her with  a line from me  one of them you can certainly get  for it is used  i  believe  by gold and silver smiths  it is nitric acid  the other is  caustic potash  or  as it is sometimes labeled  lunar caustic  it is in  little sticks  but if you find out anyone who has bought drugs or cases  of medicines  i will go with you and pick them out       there will be no difficulty about finding out where the english drugs  are  they are certain to be at one of the shops where the native doctors  buy their medicines       let us go at once  then   bathurst said   you can prepare some harmless  drink  and rabda will tell the mistress of the zenana it will bring out  a disfiguring eruption  we can be back here again this evening  will  you be here  rabda  at sunset  and wait until we come  you can tell the  woman that you have seen your father  and that he will supply her with  what she requires  make some excuse  if you can  to see the prisoner   say you are curious to see the white woman who has bewitched the nana   and if you get the opportunity whisper in her ear these words   do not  despair  friends are working for you       rabda repeated the english words several times over until she had them  perfect  then she made her way back to the palace  while bathurst and  his companion proceeded at once to the spot where they had left their  vehicle     they had but little difficulty in finding what they required  many of  the shops displayed garments  weapons  jewelry  and other things  the  plunder of the intrenchments of cawnpore  rujub entered several shops  where drugs were sold  and finally one of the traders said   i have a  large black box full of drugs which i bought from a sepoy for a rupee   but now that i have got it i do not know what to do with it  some of the  bottles doubtless contain poisons  i will sell it you for two rupees   which is the value of the box  which  as you see  is very strong and  bound with iron  the contents i place no price upon       i will take it   rujub said   i know some of the english medicines  and  may find a use for them      he paid the money  called in a coolie  and bade him take up the chest  and follow him  and they soon arrived at the juggler s house     the box  which was a hospital medical chest  was filled with drugs of  all kinds  bathurst put a stick of caustic into a small vial  and half  filled another  which had a glass stopper  with nitric acid  filled it  up with water  and tried the effect of rubbing a few drops on his arm      that is strong enough for anything   he said  with a slight exclamation  at the sharp pain   and now give me a piece of paper and pen and ink      then sitting down he wrote      my dear miss hannay  rujub  the juggler  and i will do what we can to  rescue you  we are powerless to effect anything as long as you remain  where you are  the bearer  rujub s daughter  will give you the bottles   one containing lunar caustic  the other nitric acid  the mistress of  the zenana  who wants to get rid of you  as she fears you might obtain  influence over the nana  has asked the girl to obtain from her father a  philter which will make you odious to him  the large bottle is perfectly  harmless  and you can drink its contents without fear  the caustic is  for applying to your lips  it will be painful  but i am sure you will  not mind that  and the injury will be only of a temporary nature   i cannot promise as much for the nitric acid  pray apply it very  carefully  merely moistening the glass stopper and applying it with  that  i should use it principally round the lips  it will burn and  blister the skin  the nana will be told that you have a fever  which is  causing a terrible and disfiguring eruption  i should apply it also to  the neck and hands  pray be very careful with the stuff  for  besides  the application being exceedingly painful  the scars may possibly remain  permanently  keep the two small bottles carefully hidden  in order to  renew the application if absolutely necessary  at any rate  this will  give us time  and  from what i hear  our troops are likely to be here  in another ten days  time  you will be  i know  glad to hear that wilson  has also escaped      yours      r  bathurst      a large bottle was next filled with elder flower water  the trap was  brought around  and they drove back to bithoor  rabda was punctual to  her appointment      i have seen her   she said   and have given her the message  i could  see that she understood it  but as there were other women round  she  made no sign  i told the mistress of the zenana that you had given me  some magic words that i was to whisper to her to prepare the way for the  philter  so she let me in without difficulty  and i was allowed to go  close up to her and repeat your message  i put my hands on her before  i did so  and i think she felt that it was the touch of a friend  she  hushed up when i spoke to her  the mistress  who was standing close by   thought that this was a sign of the power of the words i had spoken to  her  i did not stay more than a minute  i was afraid she might try to  speak to me in your tongue  and that would have been dangerous       there are the bottles    bathurst said   this large one is for her to  take  the other two and this note are to be given to her separately   you had better tell the woman that the philter must be given by your own  hands  and that you must then watch alone by her side for half an hour   say that after you leave her she will soon go off to sleep  and must  then be left absolutely alone till daybreak tomorrow  and it will then  be found that the philter has acted  she must at once tell the nana  that the lady is in a high fever  and has been seized with some terrible  disease that has altogether disfigured her  and that he can see for  himself the state she is in      rabda s whisper had given new life and hope to isobel hannay  previous  to that her fate had seemed to her to be sealed  and she had only prayed  for death  the long strain of the siege had told upon her  the scene in  the boat seemed a species of horrible nightmare  culminating in a  number of sepoys leaping on board the boat as it touched the bank  and  bayoneting her uncle and all on board except herself  mrs  hunter  and  her daughter  who were seized and carried ashore  then followed a night  of dull despairing pain  while she and her companions crouched together   with two sepoys standing on guard over them  while the others  after  lighting fires  talked and laughed long into the night over the success  of their attack     at daybreak they had been placed upon a limber and driven into cawnpore   her spirit had risen as they were assailed by insults and imprecations  by the roughs of the town  and she had borne up bravely till  upon their  arrival at the entrance to what she supposed was the prison  she was  roughly dragged from the limber  placed in a close carriage  and driven  off  in her despair she had endeavored to open the door in order to  throw herself under the wheels  but a soldier stood on each step and  prevented her from doing so     outside of the town she soon saw that she was on the road to bithoor   and the fate for which she was reserved flashed upon her  she remembered  now the oily compliments of nana sahib  and the unpleasant thrill she  had felt when his eyes were fixed upon her  and had she possessed a  weapon of any kind she would have put an end to her life  but her pistol  had been taken from her when she landed  and in helpless despair she  crouched in a corner of the carriage until they reached bithoor     as soon as the carriage stopped a cloth was thrown over her head  she  was lifted out and carried into the palace  through long passages and  up stairs  then those who carried her set her on her feet and retired   other hands took her and led her forward till the cloth was taken off  her head  and she found herself surrounded  by women  who regarded her  with glances of mixed curiosity and hostility  then everything seemed to  swim round  and she fainted     when she recovered consciousness all strength seemed to have left her   and she lay in a sort of apathy for hours  taking listlessly the drink  that was offered to her  but paying no attention to what was passing  around  until there was a gentle pressure on her arm  the grasp  tightening with a slight caressing motion that seemed to show sympathy   then came the english words softly whispered into her ear  while the  hand again pressed her arm firmly  as if in warning     it was with difficulty that she refrained from uttering an exclamation   and she felt the blood crimson her cheeks  but she mastered the impulse  and lay perfectly quiet  glancing up into the face bent down close to  hers  it was not familiar to her  and yet it seemed to her that she had  seen it somewhere  another minute and it was gone     but though to all appearances isobel s attitude was unchanged  her mind  was active now  who could have sent her this message  who could this  native girl be who had spoken in english to her  where had she seen the  face     her thoughts traveled backwards  and she ran over in her mind all  those with whom she had come in contact since her arrival in india  her  servants and those of her acquaintances passed before her eyes  she  had scarcely spoken to another native woman since she had landed  after  thinking over all she had known in cawnpore  she thought of deennugghur   whom had she met there     suddenly came the remembrance of the exhibition by the juggler  and  she recalled the face and figure of his daughter  as  seated  upon the  growing pole  she had gone up foot by foot in the light of the lamps and  up into the darkness above  the mystery was solved  that was the face  that had just leaned over her     but how could she be interested in her fate  then she remembered that  this was the girl whom bathurst had saved from the tiger  if they  were interested in her  it must be through bathurst  could he too have  survived the attack of the night before  she had thought of him  as of  all of them  as dead  but possibly he might have escaped  even during  the long night s waiting  a captive to the sepoys  the thought that he  had instantly sprung from beside her and leaped overboard had been  an added pang to all her misery  she had no after remembrance of him   perhaps he had swum to shore and got off in safety  in that case he must  be lingering in cawnpore  had learned what had become of her  and was  trying to rescue her  it was to the juggler he would naturally have gone  to obtain assistance  if so  he was risking his life now to save hers   and this was the man whom she despised as a coward     but what could he do  at bithoor  in the power of this treacherous  rajah  secure in the zenana  where no man save its master ever  penetrated  how could he possibly help her  yet the thought that he was  trying to do so was a happy one  and the tears that flowed between her  closed lids were not painful ones  she blamed herself now for having  felt for a moment hurt at bathurst s desertion of her  to have remained  in the boat would have been certain death  while he could have been of  no assistance to her or anyone else  that he should escape  then  if he  could  now seemed to her a perfectly natural action  she hoped that  some of the others had done the same  and that bathurst was not working  alone     it did not occur to her that there could be any possibility of the  scheme for her rescue succeeding  as to that she felt no more hopeful  than before  but it seemed to take away the sense of utter loneliness  that she before felt that someone should be interesting himself in her  fate  perhaps there would be more than a mere verbal message next time   how long would it be before she heard again  how long a respite had she  before that wretch came to see her  doubtless he had heard that she was  ill  she would remain so  she would starve herself  her weakness seemed  to her her best protection     as she lay apparently helpless upon the couch she watched the women move  about the room  the girl who had spoken to her was not among them  the  women were not unkind  they brought her cooling drinks  and tried to  tempt her to eat something  but she shook her head as if utterly unable  to do so  and after a time feigned to be asleep     darkness came on gradually  some lamps were lighted in the room  not for  a moment had she been left alone since she was brought in  never less  than two females remaining with her     presently the woman who was evidently the chief of the establishment  came in accompanied by a girl  whom isobel recognized at once as the  juggler s daughter  the latter brought with her a tray  on which were  some cakes and a silver goblet  these she set down on an oak table by  the couch  the girl then handed her the goblet  which  keeping up the  appearance of extreme feebleness  she took languidly  she placed it to  her lips  but at once took it away  it was not cool and refreshing like  those she had tasted before  it had but little flavor  but had a faint  odor  which struck her as not unfamiliar  it was a drug of some sort  they wished her to drink     she looked up in the girl s face  rabda made a reassuring gesture  and  said in a low whisper  as she bent forward   bathurst sahib      this was sufficient  whatever it was it would do her no harm  and she  raised the cup to her lips and emptied it  then the elder woman said  something to the other two  and they all left the room together  leaving  her alone with rabda     the latter went to the door quietly and drew the hangings across it   then she returned to the couch  and from the folds of her dress produced  two vials and a tiny note  then  noiselessly  she placed a lamp on the  table  and withdrew to a short distance while isobel opened and read the  note     twice she read it through  and then  laying it down  burst into tears of  relief  rabda came and knelt down beside the couch  and  taking one  of her hands  pressed it to her lips  isobel threw her arms round the  girl s neck  drew her close to her  and kissed her warmly   rabda then  drew a piece of paper and a pencil from her dress and handed them to  her  she wrote      thanks a thousand times  dear friend  i will follow your instructions   please send me if you can some quick and deadly poison  that i may take  in the last extremity  do not fear that i will flinch from applying the  things you have sent me  i would not hesitate to swallow them were there  no other hope of escape  i rejoice so much to know that you have escaped  from that terrible attack last night  did wilson alone get away  do you  know they murdered my uncle and all the others in the boat  except mrs   hunter and mary  pray do not run any risks to try and rescue me  i think  that i am safe now  and will make myself so hideous that if the wretch  once sees me he will never want to see me again  as to death  i have no  fear of it  if we do not meet again  god bless you      yours most gratefully      isobel      rabda concealed the note in her garment  and then motioned to isobel  that she should close her eyes and pretend to be asleep  then she gently  drew back the curtains and seated herself at a distance from the couch     half an hour later the mistress of the zenana came in  rabda rose and  put her finger to her lips and left the room  accompanied by the woman      she is asleep   she said   do not be afraid  the potion will do its  work  leave her alone all night  when she wakes in the morning she will  be wild with fever  and you need have no fear that the rajah will seek  to make her the queen of his zenana          chapter xx       prepared as the mistress of the zenana was to find a great change in the  captive s appearance  she was startled when  soon after daybreak  she  went in to see her  the lower part of her face was greatly swollen  her  lips were covered with white blotches  there were great red scars  round the mouth and on her forehead  and the skin seemed to have been  completely eaten away  there were even larger and deeper marks on her  neck and shoulders  which were partly uncovered  as if by her restless  tossing  her hands and arms were similarly marked  she took no notice  of her entrance  but talked to herself as she tossed restlessly on the  couch     there was but little acting in this  for isobel was suffering an agony  of pain  she had used the acid much more freely than she had been  instructed to do  determined that the disfigurement should be complete   all night she had been in a state of high fever  and had for a time been  almost delirious  she was but slightly more easy now  and had difficulty  in preventing herself from crying out from the torture she was  suffering     there was no tinge of pity in the face of the woman who looked at her   but a smile of satisfaction at the manner in which the potion had done  its work      the nana can see her now   she said to herself   there will be no  change in the arrangements here      she at once sent out word that as soon as the rajah was up he was to be  told that she begged him to come at once     an hour later he came to the door of the zenana      what is it  poomba   he asked   nothing the matter with miss hannay  i  hope       i grieve to say  your highness  that she has been seized with some  terrible disease  i know not what it is  for never did i see a woman so  smitten  it must be an illness contracted from confinement and bad air  during the siege  some illness that the europeans have  for never did i  see aught like it  she is in a high state of fever  and her face is in a  terrible state  it must be a sort of plague       you have been poisoning her   the nana said roughly   if so  beware   for your life shall be the forfeit  i will see her for myself       she has had no poison since she came here  though i know not but what  she may have had poison about her  and may have taken it after she was  captured       take me to her   the rajah said   i will see for myself       it may be a contagious disease  your highness  it were best that you  should not go near her      the rajah made an impatient gesture  and the woman  without another  word  led him into the room where isobel was lying  the nana was  prepared for some disfigurement of the face he had so admired  but he  shrank back from the reality      it is horrible   he said  in a low voice   what have you been doing to  her   he asked  turning furiously to the woman      i have done nothing  your highness  all day yesterday she lay in a  torpor  as i told you in the evening when you inquired about her  and i  thought then she was going to be ill  i have watched her all night   she has been restless and disturbed  but i thought it better not to go  nearer lest i should wake her  and it was not until this morning  when  the day broke  that i perceived this terrible change  what shall we do  with her  if the disease is contagious  everyone in the palace may catch  it       have a closed palanquin brought to the door  wrap her up  and have  her carried down to the subada ke kothee  let her give it to the women  there  burn all the things in this room  and everything that has been  worn by those who have entered it  i will inquire into this matter later  on  and should i find that there has been any foul play  those concerned  in it shall wish they had never been born      as soon as he had left the woman called rabda in      all has gone well   she said   your father s philter is powerful  indeed  tell him whenever he needs any service i can render he has but  to ask it  look at her  did you ever see one so disfigured  the rajah  has seen her  and is filled with loathing  she is to be sent to the  subada ke kothee  are you sure that the malady is not contagious  i have  persuaded the rajah that it is  that is why he is sending her away       i am sure it is not   rabda said   it is the result of the drugs  it is  terrible to see her  give me some cooling ointment       what does it matter about her now that she is harmless   poomba said  scornfully  being  however  desirous of pleasing rabda  she went away  and brought a pot of ointment  which the girl applied to the sores  the  tears falling down her cheeks as she did so     the salve at once afforded relief from the burning pain  and isobel  gratefully took a drink prepared from fresh limes     she had only removed her gown when she had lain down  having done this  in order that it should not be burned by the acid  and that her neck  and shoulders might be seen  and the belief induced that this strange  eruption was all over her  rabda made signs for her to put it on again   and pointing in the direction of cawnpore  repeated the word several  times  and isobel felt with a thrill of intense thankfulness that the  stratagem had succeeded  and that she was to be sent away at once   probably to the place where the other prisoners were confined  presently  the woman returned      rabda  you had best go with her  it were well that you should leave  for the present  the rajah is suspicious  he may come back again and ask  questions  and as he knows you by sight  and as you told me your father  was in disfavor with him at present  he might suspect that you were in  some way concerned in the matter       i will go   rabda said   i am sorry she has suffered so much  i did not  think the potion would have been so strong  give me a netful of fresh  limes and some cooling lotion  that i may leave with her there      in a few minutes a woman came up to say that the palanquin was in  readiness at the gate of the zenana garden  a large cushion was taken  off a divan  and isobel was laid upon it and covered with a light  shawl  six of the female attendants lifted it and carried it downstairs   accompanied by rabda and the mistress off the zenana  both closely  veiled  outside the gate was a large palanquin  with its bearers and  four soldiers and an officer  the cushion was lifted and placed in the  palanquin  and rabda also took her place there      then you will not return today   the woman said to her  in a voice loud  enough to be heard by the officers  you will remain with her for a time   and afterwards go to see your friends in the town  i will send for you  when i hear that you wish to return      the curtains of the palanquin were drawn down  the bearers lifted it and  started at once for cawnpore     on arrival at the large building known as the subada ke kothee the  gates were opened at once at the order of the nana s officer  and the  palanquin was carried across the courtyard to the door of the building  which was used as a prison for the white women and children  it was  taken into the great arched room and set down  rabda stepped out  and  the bearers lifted out the cushion upon which isobel lay      you will not be wanted any more   rabda said  in a tone of authority    you can return to bithoor at once      as the door closed behind them several of the ladies came round to  see this fresh arrival  rabda looked round till her eye fell upon mrs   hunter  who was occupied in trying to hush a fractious child  she put  her hand on her arm and motioned to her to come along  surprised at the  summons  mrs  hunter followed her  when they reached the cushion rabda  lifted the shawl from isobel s face  for a moment mrs  hunter failed to  recognize her  but as isobel opened her eyes and held out her hand she  knew her  and with a cry of pity she dropped on her knees beside her      my poor child  what have these fiends been doing to you       they have been doing nothing  mrs  hunter   she whispered   i am not  so bad as i seem  though i have suffered a great deal of pain  i was  carried away to bithoor  to nana sahib s zenana  and i have burnt my  face with caustic and acid  they think i have some terrible disease  and  have sent me here       bravely done  girl  bravely and nobly done  we had best keep the secret  to ourselves  there are constantly men looking through the bars of the  window  and some of them may understand english      then she looked up and said   it is miss hannay  she was captured with  us in the boats  please help me to carry her over to the wall there  and  my daughter and i will nurse her  it looks as if she had been terribly  burnt  somehow      many of the ladies had met isobel in the happy days before the troubles  began  and great was the pity expressed at her appearance  she was  carried to the side of the wall  where mary and mrs  hunter at once made  her as comfortable as they could  rabda  who had now thrown back her  veil  produced from under her dress the net containing some fifty small  limes  and handed to mrs  hunter the pot of ointment and the lotion      she has saved me   isobel said   it is the daughter of the juggler who  performed at your house  mrs  hunter  do thank her for me  and tell her  how grateful i am      mrs  hunter took rabda s hand  and in her own language thanked her for  her kindness to isobel      i have done as i was told   rabda said simply   the sahib bathurst  saved my life  and when he said the lady must be rescued from the hands  of the nana  it was only right that i should do so  even at the risk of  my life       so bathurst has escaped   mrs  hunter said  turning to isobel   i am  glad of that  dear  i was afraid that all were gone       yes  i had a note from him  it is by his means that i got away from  bithoor  he sent me the caustic and acid to burn my face  he told me  mr  wilson had also escaped  and perhaps some others may have got away   though he did not seem to know it       but surely there could be no occasion to burn yourself as badly as you  have done  isobel       i am afraid i did put on too much acid   she said   i was so afraid  of not burning it enough  but it does not matter  it does not pain me  nearly so much since i put on that ointment  it will soon get well      mrs  hunter shook her head regretfully      i am afraid it will leave marks for a long time       that is of no consequence at all  mrs  hunter  i am so thankful at  being here with you  that i should mind very little if i knew that it  was always to be as bad as it is now  what does it matter       it does not matter at all at present  my dear  but if you ever get out  of this horrible place  some day you may think differently about it       i must go now   rabda said   has the lady any message to send to the  sahib   and she again handed a paper and pencil to isobel     the girl took them  hesitating a little before writing      thank god you have saved me  some day  perhaps  i may be able to tell  you how grateful i am  but  if not  you will know that if the worst  happens to us  i shall die blessing you for what you have done for me   pray do not linger longer in cawnpore  you may be discovered  and if i  am spared  it would embitter my life always to know that it had cost you  yours  god bless you always      yours gratefully      isobel      she folded up the paper and gave it to rabda  who took her hand and  kissed it  and then  drawing her veil again over her face  went to the  door  which stood open for the moment     some men were bringing in a large cauldron of rice  the sentries offered  no opposition to her passing out  as the officer with the palanquin  had told them that a lady of the rajah s zenana would leave shortly   a similar message had been given to the officer at the main gate  who   however  requested to see her hand and arm to satisfy him that all was  right  this was sufficient to assure him that it was not a white woman  passing out in disguise  and rabda at once proceeded to her father s  house     as she expected  he and bathurst were away  for she had arranged to meet  them at eight o clock in the garden  they did not return until eleven   having waited two hours for her  and returning home in much anxiety at  her non appearance      what has happened  why did you not meet us  rabda   her father  exclaimed  as he entered     rabda rapidly repeated the incidents that had happened since she had  parted from him the evening before  and handed to bathurst the two notes  she had received from isobel      then she is in safety with the others   he exclaimed in delight   thank  god for that  and thank you  rabda  indeed  for what you have done       my life is my lord s   the girl said quietly   what i have done is  nothing       if we had but known  rujub  that she would be moved at once  we might  have rescued her on the way      rujub shook his head      there are far too many people along the road  sahib  it could not have  been done  but  of course  there was no knowing that she would be sent  off directly after the nana had seen her       is she much disfigured  rabda   bathurst asked      dreadfully   the girl said sorrowfully   the acid must have been too  strong       it was strong  no doubt   bathurst said   but if she had put it on as i  instructed her it could only have burnt the surface of the skin       it has burnt her dreadfully  sahib  even i should hardly have known  her  she must be brave indeed to have done it  she must have suffered  dreadfully  but i obtained some ointment for her  and she was better  when i left her  she is with the wife of the sahib hunter       now  rabda  see if the meal is prepared   rujub said   we are both  hungry  and you can have eaten nothing this morning      he then left the room  leaving bathurst to read the letters which he  still held in his hand  feeling that they were too precious to be looked  at until he was alone     it was some time before rabda brought in his breakfast  and  glancing at  him  she saw how deeply he had been moved by the letters  she went up to  him and placed her hand on his shoulder      we will get her for you  sahib  we have been successful so far  be  assured that we shall succeed again  what we have done is more difficult  than what we have to do  it is easier to get twenty prisoners from a  jail than one from a rajah s zenana       that is true enough  rabda  at the moment i was not thinking of that   but of other things      he longed for sympathy  but the girl would not have understood him had  he told her his feelings  to her he was a hero  and it would have seemed  to her folly had he said that he felt himself altogether unworthy of  isobel hannay  after he had finished his breakfast rujub again came in      what does the sahib intend to do now   he asked      as far as i can see there is nothing to do at present  rujub   he said    when the white troops come up she will be delivered       then will my lord go down to allahabad       certainly not  there is no saying what may happen       that is so   rujub agreed   the white women are safe at present  but  if  as the sahib thinks  the white soldiers should beat the troops of  the nana  who can say what will happen  the people will be wild with  rage  the nana will be furious  he is a tiger who  having once laid his  paw on a victim  will not allow it to be torn from him       he can never allow them to be injured   bathurst said   it is possible  that as our troops advance he may carry them all off as hostages  and by  the threat of killing them may make terms for his own life  but he would  never venture to carry out his threats  you think he would   he asked     rujub remained silent for a minute      i think so  sahib  the nana is an ambitious man  he has wealth and  everything most men would desire to make life happy  but he wanted more   he thought that when the british raj was destroyed he would rule over  the territories of the peishwa  and be one of the greatest lords of the  land  he has staked everything on that  if he loses  he has lost all  he  knows that after the breach of his oath and the massacre here  there is  no pardon for him  he is a tiger  and a wounded tiger is most dangerous   if he is  as you believe he will be  defeated  i believe his one thought  will be of revenge  every day brings news of fresh risings  scindia s  army will join us  holkar s will probably follow  all oude is rising in  arms  a large army is gathering at delhi  even if the nana is defeated  here all will not be lost  he has twenty thousand men  there are well  nigh two hundred thousand in arms round lucknow alone  my belief is  that if beaten his first thought will be to take revenge at once on the  feringhees  and to make his name terrible  and that he will then go off  with his army to lucknow or delhi  where he would be received as one who  has dared more than all others to defy the whites  who has no hope of  pardon  and can  therefore  be relied upon above all others to fight to  the last       it may be so  rujub  though i can scarce believe that there exists a  monster who would give orders for the murder of hundreds of women and  children in cold blood  but  at any rate  i will remain and watch   we will decide upon what will be the best plan to rescue her from the  prison  if we hear that evil is intended  but  if not  i can remain  patiently until our troops arrive  i know the subada ke kothee  it is   if i remember right  a large quadrangle with no windows on the outside       that is so  sahib  it is a strong place  and difficult indeed to get  into or out of  there is only the main gate  which is guarded at night  by two sentries outside and there is doubtless a strong guard within       i would learn whether the same regiment always furnishes the guard  if  so  it might be possible to bribe them       i am afraid it would be too dangerous to try  there are scores of men  in cawnpore who would cut a throat for a rupee  but when it comes to  breaking open a prison to carry off one of these white women whom they  hate it would be too dangerous to try       could you not do something with your art  rujub       if there were only the outside sentries it would be easy enough  sahib   i could send them to sleep with a wave of my hand  but i could not  affect the men inside whom i do not know even by sight  besides  in  addition to the soldiers who guard the gate  there will be the men who  have been told off to look after the prisoners  it will require a great  deal of thinking over  sahib  but i believe we shall manage it  i shall  go tomorrow to bithoor and show myself boldly to the nana  he knows that  i have done good service to him  and his anger will have cooled down by  this time  and he will listen to what i have to say  it will be useful  to us for me to be able to go in and out of the palace at will  and so  learn the first news from those about him  it is most important that we  should know if he has evil intentions towards the captives  so that we  may have time to carry out our plans       very well  rujub  you do not expect me to remain indoors  i hope  for i  should wear myself out if i were obliged to wait here doing nothing       no  sahib  it will be perfectly safe for you to go about just as you  are  and i can get you any other disguise you like  you will gather what  is said in the town  can listen to the sepoys  and examine the subada ke  kothee  if you like i will go there with you now  my daughter shall come  with us  she may be useful  and will be glad to be doing something      they went out from the city towards the prison house  which stood in  an open space round which were several other buildings  some of them  surrounded with gardens and walls     the subada ke kothee was a large building  forming three sides of a  square  a strong high wall forming the fourth side  it was low  with a  flat roof  there were no windows or openings in the outside wall  the  chambers all facing the courtyard  two sentries were at the gate  they  were in the red sepoy uniform  and bathurst saw at once how much the  bonds of discipline had been relaxed  both had leaned their muskets  against the wall  one was squatted on the ground beside his firearm  and  the other was talking with two or three natives of his acquaintance  the  gates were closed     as they watched  a native officer came up  he stood for a minute  talking with the soldiers  by his gesticulations it could be seen he was  exceedingly angry  and the men took their muskets and began to walk up  and down  then the officer knocked at the gate  instead of its being  opened  a man appeared at a loophole in the gate tower  and the officer  handed to him a paper  a minute later the gate was opened sufficiently  for him to pass in  and was then closed behind him      they are evidently pretty strict   bathurst said   i don t think   rujub  there is much chance of our doing anything there      rujub shook his head   no  sahib  it is clear they have strict orders  about opening and shutting the gate       it would not be very difficult to scale the wall of the house    bathurst said   with a rope and a hook at its end  but that is only the  first step  the real difficulty lies in getting the prison room open in  the first place  for no doubt they are locked up at night  and in the  second getting her out of it  and the building       you could lower her down from the top of the wall  sahib       yes  if one could get her out of the room they are confined in without  making the slightest stir  but it is almost too much to hope that one  could be able to do that  the men in charge of them are likely to keep  a close watch  for they know that their heads would pay for any captive  they allowed to escape       i don t think they will watch much  sahib  they will not believe that  any of the women  broken down as they must be by trouble  would attempt  such a thing  for even if they got out of the prison itself and then  made their escape from the building  they would be caught before they  could go far       where does the prison house lie  rabda   bathurst asked      it is on the left hand side as you enter the gate  it is the farthest  door  along that side most of the buildings  which have been used for  storehouses  i should say  or perhaps for the guards when the place  was a palace  have two floors  one above the other  but this is a large  vaulted room extending from the ground to the roof  it has windows with  iron gratings  the door is very strong and heavy       and now  sahib  we can do nothing more   rujub said   i will return  home with rabda  and then go over to bithoor       very well  rujub  i will stay here  and hear what people are talking  about      there were indeed a considerable number of people near the building   the fact that the white prisoners were within seemed to exercise a  fascination  and even women brought their children and sat on the  banks which marked where gardens had once been  and talked of the  white captives  bathurst strolled about among the groups of sepoys and  townspeople  the former talked in loud tones of the little force that  had already started from allahabad  and boasted how easily they would  eat up the feringhees  it seemed  however  to bathurst that a good deal  of this confidence was assumed  and that among some  at least  there was  an undercurrent of doubt and uneasiness  though they talked as loudly  and boldly as their companions     the townspeople were of two classes  there were the budmashes or roughs  of the place  who uttered brutal and ferocious jokes as to the probable  fate of the white women  there were others who kept in groups apart and  talked in low voices  these were the traders  to whom the events that  had taken place foreboded ruin  already most of the shops had been  sacked  and many of the principal inhabitants murdered by the mob   those who had so far escaped  thanks in some instances to the protection  afforded them by sepoy officers  saw that their trade was ruined  their  best customers killed  and themselves virtually at the mercy of the mob   who might again break out upon the occasion of any excitement  these  were silent when bathurst approached them  his attire  and the arms so  ostentatiously displayed in his sash  marked him as one of the dangerous  class  perhaps a prisoner from the jail whose doors had been thrown open  on the first night of the sepoy rising     for hours bathurst remained in the neighborhood of the prison  the sun  set  and the night came on  then a small party of soldiers came up and  relieved the sentries  this time the number of the sentries at the gate  was doubled  and three men were posted  one on each of the other sides  of the building  after seeing this done he returned to the house  after  he had finished his evening meal rujub and rabda came into the room      now  sahib   the former said   i think that we can tell you how the  lady is  rabda has seen her  spoken to her  and touched her  there is  sympathy between them      he seated rabda in a chair  placed his hand on her forehead  and then  drew the tips of his fingers several times slowly down her face  her  eyes closed  he took up her hand  and let it fall again  it was limp and  impassive  then he said authoritatively   go to the prison   he paused a  moment      are you there       i am there   she said      are you in the room where the ladies are       i am there   she repeated      do you see the lady hannay       i see her       how is she       she is lying quiet  the other young lady is sitting beside her  the  lower part of her face is bandaged up  but i can see that she is not  suffering as she was this morning  she looks quiet and happy       try and speak to her  say   keep up your courage  we are doing what we  can   speak  i order you       i have spoken       did she hear you       yes  she has raised herself on her arm  she is looking round  she has  asked the other young lady if she heard anything  the other shakes her  head  she heard my words  but does not understand them      rujub looked at bathurst  who mechanically repeated the message in  english      speak to her again  tell her these words   and rujub repeated the  message in english      does she hear you       she hears me  she has clasped her hands  and is looking round  bewildered       that will do  now go outside into the yard  what do you see there       i see eight men sitting round a fire  one gets up and walks to one of  the grated windows  and looks in at the prisoners       is the door locked       it is locked       where is the key      she was silent for some time      where is the key   he repeated      in the lock   she said      how many soldiers are there in the guardroom by the gate       there are no soldiers there  there are an officer and four men outside   but none inside       that will do   and he passed his hand lightly across her forehead      is it all true   bathurst asked  as the juggler turned to him      assuredly it is true  sahib  had i had my daughter with me at  deennugghur  i could have sent you a message as easily  as it was  i had  to trust only to the power of my mind upon yours  the information is of  use  sahib       it is indeed  it is a great thing to know that the key is left in the  lock  and also that at night there are the prison keepers only inside  the building       does she know what she has been doing   he asked  as rabda languidly  rose from her chair      no  sahib  she knows nothing after she has recovered from these  trances       i will watch tomorrow night   bathurst said   and see at what hour the  sentries are relieved  it is evident that the sepoys are not trusted  to enter the prison  which is left entirely to the warders  the outside  posts being furnished by some regiment in the lines  it is important to  know the exact hour at which the changes are made  and perhaps you  could find out tomorrow  rujub  who these warders are  whether they are  permanently on duty  or are relieved once a day       i will do that  sahib  if they are changed we may be able to get at  some of them       i have no money   bathurst said   but        i have money  sahib  and if they can be bribed  will do it  our  caste is a rich one  we sometimes receive large presents  and we are  everywhere made welcome  we have little need of money  i am wealthy  and  practice my art more because i love it than for gain  there are few in  the land that know the secrets that i do  men die without having sons  to pass down their knowledge  thus it is the number of those who possess  the secrets of the ancient grows smaller every day  there are hundreds  of jugglers  but very few who know  as i do  the secrets of nature  and  can control the spirits of the air  did i need greater wealth than i  have  rabda could discover for me all the hidden treasures of india   and i could obtain them  guarded though they may be by djins and evil  spirits       have you a son to come after you  rujub       yes  he is traveling in persia  to confer with one or two of the great  ones there who still possess the knowledge of the ancient magicians       by the way  rujub  i have not asked you how you got on with the nana       it was easy enough   the juggler said   he had lost all interest in  the affairs of deennugghur  and greeted me at first as if i had just  returned from a journey  then he remembered and asked me suddenly why i  had disobeyed his orders and given my voice for terms being granted to  the feringhees  i said that i had obeyed his orders  i understood that  what he principally desired was to have the women here as prisoners  and  that had the siege continued the feringhees would have blown themselves  into the air  therefore the only plan was to make terms with them  which  would  in fact  place them all in his power  as he would not be bound  by the conditions granted by the oude men  he was satisfied  and said no  more about it  and i am restored to my position in his favor  henceforth  we shall not have to trust to the gossip of the bazaars  but i shall  know what news is received and what is going to be done      your people at delhi have beaten back the sepoys several times  and at  lucknow they resist stoutly  the nana is very angry that the place has  not been taken  but from what i hear the intrenchments there are much  stronger than they were here  and even here they were not taken by the  sword  but because the whites had no shelter from the guns  and could  not go to the well without exposing themselves to the fire  at lucknow  they have some strong houses in the intrenchments  and no want of  anything  so they can only be captured by fighting  everyone says they  cannot hold out many days longer  but that i do not know  it does not  seem to me that there is any hope of rescue for them  for even if  as  you think  the white troops should beat nana sahib s men  they  never could force their way through the streets of lucknow to the  intrenchments there       we shall see  rujub  deennugghur was defended by a mere handful  and  at lucknow they have half a regiment of white soldiers  they may  for  anything i know  have to yield to starvation  but i doubt whether the  mutineers and oude men  however numerous they may be  will carry the  place by assault  is there any news elsewhere       none  sahib  save that the feringhees are bringing down regiments from  the punjaub to aid those at delhi       the tide is beginning to turn  rujub  the mutineers have done their  worst  and have failed to overthrow the english raj  now you will see  that every day they will lose ground  fresh troops will pour up the  country  and step by step the mutiny will be crushed out  it is a  question of time only  if you could call up a picture on smoke of what  will be happening a year hence  you would see the british triumphant  everywhere       i cannot do that  sahib  i do not know what would appear on the smoke   and were i to try  misfortune would surely come upon me  when a picture  of the past is shown on the smoke  it is not a past i know of  but which  one of those present knows  i cannot always say which among them may  know it  it is always a scene that has made a strong impression on the  mind  but more than that i do not know  as to those of the future  i  know even less  it is the work of the power of the air  whose name i  whisper to myself when i pour out the incense  and to whom i pray  it  is seldom that i show these pictures  he gets angry if called upon too  often  i never do it unless i feel that he is propitious       it is beyond me altogether  rujub  i can understand your power of  sending messages  and of your daughter seeing at a distance  i  have heard of such things at home  they are called mesmerism and  clairvoyance  it is an obscure art  but that some men do possess the  power of influencing others at a distance seems to be undoubted  still  it is certainly never carried to such perfection as i see it in your  case       it could not be   rujub said   white men eat too much  and it needs  long fasting and mortification to fit a man to become a mystic  the  spirit gains power as the body weakens  the feringhees can make arms  that shoot long distances  and carriages that travel faster than the  fastest horse  and great ships and machines  they can do many great and  useful things  but they cannot do the things that have been done for  thousands of years in the east  they are tied too fast to the earth  to have aught to do with the spirits that dwell in the air  a learned  brahmin  who had studied your holy books  told me that your great  teacher said that if you had faith you could move mountains  we could  well nigh do that if it were of use to mankind  but were we to do so  merely to show our power  we should be struck dead  it is wrong even to  tell you these things  i must say no more      four days passed  rujub went every day for some hours to bithoor  and  told bathurst that he heard that the british force  of about fourteen  hundred whites and five hundred sikhs  was pushing forward rapidly   making double marches each day      the first fight will be near futtehpore   he said   there are fifteen  hundred sepoys  as many oude tribesmen  and five hundred cavalry with  twelve guns  and they are in a very strong position  which the british  can only reach by passing along the road through a swamp  it is a  position that the officers say a thousand men could hold against ten  thousand       you will see that it will not delay our troops an hour   bathurst said    do they imagine they are going to beat us  when the numbers are but  two to one in their favor  if so  they will soon learn that they are  mistaken      the next afternoon  when rujub returned  he said   you were right   sahib  your people took futtehpore after only half an hour s fighting   the accounts say that the feringhees came on like demons  and that they  did not seem to mind our firing in the slightest  the nana is furious   but they still feel confident that they will succeed in stopping the  feringhees at dong  they lost their twelve guns at futtehpore  but they  have two heavy ones at the pandoo bridge  which sweep the straight road  leading to it for a mile  and the bridge has been mined  and will be  blown up if the feringhees reach it  but  nevertheless  the nana swears  that he will be revenged on the captives  if you are to rescue the lady  it must be done tonight  for tomorrow it may be too late       you surely do not think he will give orders for the murder of the women  and children       i fear he will do so   rujub answered gloomily     each day bathurst had learned in the same manner as before what  was doing in the prison  isobel was no longer being nursed  she was  assisting to nurse mary hunter  who had  the day after isobel was  transferred to the prison  been attacked by fever  and was the next  day delirious  rabda s report of the next two days left little doubt in  bathurst s mind that she was rapidly sinking  all the prisoners suffered  greatly from the close confinement  many had died  and the girl s  description of the scenes she witnessed was often interrupted by her  sobs and tears         chapter xxi       while bathurst was busying himself completing his preparations for the  attempt  rabda came in with her father      my lord   she said   i tremble at the thought of your venturing your  life  my life is of no importance  and it belongs to you  what i would  propose is this  my father will go to bithoor  and will obtain an order  from one of the nana s officers for a lady of the zenana to visit the  prisoners  i will go in veiled  as i was on the day i went there  i will  change garments with the lady  and she can come out veiled  and meet you  outside       i would not dream of such a thing  rabda  you would be killed to a  certainty when they discovered the trick  even if i would consent to the  sacrifice  miss hannay would not do so  i am deeply grateful to you for  proposing it  but it is impossible  you will see that  with the aid of  your father  i shall succeed       i told her that would be your answer  sahib   rujub said   but she  insisted on making the offer      it was arranged that they were to start at nine o clock  as it was safer  to make the attempt before everything became quiet  before starting   rabda was again placed in a trance  in reply to her father s questions  she said that mary hunter was dead  and that isobel was lying down  she  was told to tell her that in an hour she was to be at the window next to  the door     rujub had found that the men inside the prison were those who had been  employed as warders at the jail before the troubles began  and he had  procured for bathurst a dress similar to that which they wore  which  was a sort of uniform  he had offered  if the attempt was successful   to conceal isobel in his house until the troops reached cawnpore  but  bathurst preferred to take her down the country  upon the ground that  every house might be searched  and that possibly before the british  entered the town there might be a general sack of the place by the mob   and even if this did not take place there might be desperate house to  house fighting when the troops arrived  rujub acknowledged the danger   and said that he and his daughter would accompany them on their way down  country  as it would greatly lessen their risk if two of the party were  really natives  bathurst gratefully accepted the offer  as it would make  the journey far more tolerable for isobel if she had rabda with her     she was to wait a short distance from the prison while bathurst made the  attempt  and was left in a clump of bushes two or three hundred yards  away from the prison  rujub accompanied bathurst  they went along  quietly until within fifty yards of the sentry in the rear of the  house  and then stopped  the man was walking briskly up and down   rujub stretched out his arms in front of him with the fingers extended   bathurst  who had taken his place behind him  saw his muscles stiffen   while there was a tremulous motion of his fingers  in a minute or two  the sentry s walk became slower  in a little time it ceased altogether   and he leaned against the wall as if drowsy  then he slid down in a  sitting position  his musket falling to the ground      you can come along now   rujub said   he is fast asleep  and there is  no fear of his waking  he will sleep till i bid him wake      they at once moved forward to the wall of the house  bathurst threw up  a knotted rope  to which was attached a large hook  carefully wrapped in  flannel to prevent noise  after three or four attempts it caught on the  parapet  bathurst at once climbed up  as soon as he had gained the flat  terrace  rujub followed him  they then pulled up the rope  to the lower  end of which a rope ladder was attached  and fastened this securely   then they went to the inner side of the terrace and looked down onto  the courtyard  two men were standing at one of the grated windows of the  prison room  apparently looking in  six others were seated round a fire  in the center of the court     bathurst was about to turn away when rujub touched him and pointed to  the two men at the window  and then stretched out his arms towards them   presently they turned and left the window  and in a leisurely way walked  across the court and entered a room where a light was burning close to  the grate  for two or three minutes rujub stood in the same position   then his arms dropped      they have gone into the guard room to sleep   he said   there are two  less to trouble you      then he turned towards the group of men by the fire and fixed his gaze  upon them  in a short time one of them wrapped himself in his cloth and  lay down  in five minutes two others had followed his example  another  ten minutes passed  and then rujub turned to bathurst and said   i  cannot affect the other three  we cannot influence everyone       that will do  rujub  it is my turn now      after a short search they found stairs leading down from the terrace   and after passing through some empty rooms reached a door opening into  the courtyard      do you stay here  rujub   bathurst said   they will take me for one of  themselves  if i succeed without noise  i shall come this way  if not   we will go out through the gate  and you had best leave by the way we  came      the door was standing open  and bathurst  grasping a heavy tulwar  went  out into the courtyard  keeping close to the house  he sauntered along  until he reached the grated windows of the prison room  three lamps were  burning within  to enable the guard outside to watch the prisoners  he  passed the two first windows  at the third a figure was standing  she  shrank back as bathurst stopped before it      it is i  miss hannay  bathurst  danger threatens you  and you must  escape at once  rabda is waiting for you outside  please go to the door  and stand there until i open it  i have no doubt that i shall succeed   but if anything should go wrong  go and lie down again at once      without waiting for an answer  he moved towards the fire      is that you  ahmed   one of the warders said   we all seem sleepy this  evening  there is something in the air  i felt half inclined to go off  myself       it is very hot tonight   bathurst replied     there was something in his voice unfamiliar to the man  and with an  exclamation   who is it   he sprang to his feet  but bathurst was now  but three paces away  and with a bound was upon him  bringing the tulwar  down with such force upon his head that the man fell lifeless without a  groan  the other two leaped up with shouts of  treachery   but bathurst  was upon them  and  aided by the surprise  cut both down after a sharp  fight of half a minute  then he ran to the prison door  turned the key  in the lock  and opened it      come   he exclaimed   there is no time to be lost  the guards outside  have taken the alarm   for  by this time  there was a furious knocking  at the gate   wrap yourself up in this native robe       but the others  mr  bathurst  can t you save them too       impossible   he said   even if they got out  they would be overtaken  and killed at once  come   and taking her hand  he led her to the gate      stand back here so that the gate will open on you   he said  then he  undid the bar  shouting   treachery  the prisoners are escaping      as he undid the last bolt the gate opened and the soldiers rushed in   firing at random as they did so  bathurst had stepped behind the gate  as it opened  and as the soldiers ran up the yard he took isobel s hand   and  passing through the gate  ran with her round the building until he  reached the spot where rabda was awaiting them  half a minute later her  father joined them      let us go at once  there is no time for talking   he said   we must be  cautious  the firing will wake the whole quarter   for by this time  loud shouts were being raised  and men  hearing the muskets fired   were running towards the gate  taking advantage of the shelter of the  shrubbery as much as they could  they hurried on until they issued into  the open country      do you feel strong enough to walk far   bathurst asked  speaking for  the first time since they left the gate      i think so   she said   i am not sure whether i am awake or dreaming       you are awake  miss hannay  you are safe out of that terrible prison       i am not sure   the girl said  speaking slowly   i have been strange  since i went there  i have seemed to hear voices speaking to me  though  no one was there  and no one else heard them  and i am not sure whether  all this is not fancy now       it is reality  miss hannay  take my hand and you will see that it  is solid  the voices you heard were similar to those i heard at  deennugghur  they were messages i sent you by means of rujub and his  daughter       i did think of what you told me and about the juggler  but it seemed  so strange  i thought that my brain was turning with trouble  it was  bad enough at deennugghur  but nothing to what it has been since that  dreadful day at bithoor  there did not seem much hope at deennugghur   but somehow we all kept up  and  desperate as it seemed  i don t think  we ever quite despaired  you see  we all knew each other  besides  no  one could give way while the men were fighting and working so hard for  us  but at cawnpore there seemed no hope  there was not one woman there  but had lost husband or father  most of them were indifferent to life   scarcely ever speaking  and seeming to move in a dream  while others  with children sat holding them close to them as if they dreaded a  separation at any moment  there were a few who were different  who moved  about and nursed the children and sick  and tried to comfort the others   just as mrs  hunter did at deennugghur  there was no crying and no  lamenting  it would have been a relief if anyone had cried  it was the  stillness that was so trying  when people talked to each other they did  it in a whisper  as they do in a room where someone is lying dead      you know mary hunter died yesterday  well  mrs  hunter quite put aside  her own grief and tried to cheer others  i told her the last message i  received  and asked her to go with me if it should be true  she said    no  isobel  i don t know whether this message is a dream  or whether  god has opened a way of escape for you  if so  may he be thanked  but  you must go alone  one might escape where two could not  as for me  i  shall wait here for whatever fate god may send me  my husband and  my children have gone before me  i may do some good among these poor  creatures  and here i shall stay  you are young and full of life  and  have many happy days in store for you  my race is nearly run  even did  i wish for life  i would not cumber you and your friends  there will be  perils to encounter and fatigues to be undergone  had not mary left us i  would have sent her with you  but god did not will it so  go  therefore   to the window  dear  as you were told by this message you think you have  received  but do not be disappointed if no one comes  if it turns out  true  and there is a chance of escape  take it  dear  and may god be  with you   as i stood at the window  i could not go at once  as you told  me  to the door  i had to stand there  i saw it all till you turned and  ran to the door  and then i came to meet you       it was a pity you saw it   he said gently      why  do you think that  after what i have gone through  i was shocked  at seeing you kill three of those wretches  two months ago i suppose i  should have thought it dreadful  but those two months have changed us  altogether  think of what we were then and what we are now  there remain  only you  mrs  hunter  myself  and your letter said  mr  wilson  is he  the only one       yes  so far as we know       only we four  and all the others gone  uncle and mary and amy and the  doolans and the dear doctor  all the children  why  if the door had been  open  and i had had a weapon  i would have rushed out to help you kill   i shudder at myself sometimes      after a pause she went on   then none of those in the other boat came to  shore  mr  bathurst  except mr  wilson       i fear not  the other boat sank directly  wilson told me it was sinking  as he sprang over  you had better not talk any more  miss hannay  for  you are out of breath now  and will need all your strength       yes  but tell me why you have taken me away  you said there was great  danger       our troops are coming up   he said   and i had reason to fear that when  the rebels are defeated the mob may break open the prison       they surely could not murder women and children who have done them no  harm       there is no saying what they might do  miss hannay  but that was the  reason why i dared not leave you where you were  i will tell you more  about it afterwards  now  please take my arm  we must be miles away from  here before morning  they will find out then that you have escaped  and  will no doubt scour the country      they had left the road and were passing through the fields  isobel s  strength failed rapidly  as soon as the excitement that had at first  kept her up subsided  rujub several times urged bathurst to go faster   but the girl hung more and more heavily on his arm      i can t go any farther   she said at last   it is so long since i  walked  and i suppose i have got weak  i have tried very hard  but i can  scarcely drag my feet along  you had better leave me  you have done all  you could to save me  i thank you so much  only please leave a pistol  with me  i am not at all afraid of dying  but i will not fall into their  hands again       we must carry her  rujub   bathurst said   she is utterly exhausted and  worn out  and no wonder  if we could make a sort of stretcher  it would  be easy enough      rujub took the cloth from his shoulders  and laid it on the ground by  the side of isobel  who had now sunk down and was lying helpless      lift her onto this  sahib  then we will take the four corners and carry  her  it will be no weight      bathurst lifted isobel  in spite of her feeble protest  and laid her on  the cloth      i will take the two corners by her head   bathurst said   if you will  each take one of the others       no  sahib  the weight is all at the head  you take one corner  and i  will take the other  rabda can take the two corners at the feet  we can  change about when we like      isobel had lost greatly in weight since the siege of deennugghur began   and she was but a light burden for her three bearers  who started with  her at a speed considerably greater than that at which she had walked      which way are you taking us  rujub   bathurst asked presently   i have  lost my bearings altogether       i am keeping near the river  sahib  i know the country well  we cannot  follow the road  for there the rajah s troops and the sepoys and the  oude men are gathered to oppose your people  they will fight tomorrow  at dong  as i told you  but the main body is not far from here  we must  keep far away from them  and if your people take dong we can then join  them if we like  this road keeps near the river all the way  and we are  not likely to meet sepoys here  as it is by the other road the white  troops are coming up      after four hours  walking  rujub said   there is a large wood just  ahead  we will go in there  we are far enough off cawnpore to be safe  from any parties they may send out to search  if your people take  dong tomorrow  they will have enough to think of in cawnpore without  troubling about an escaped prisoner  besides   he added   if the rajah s  orders are carried out  at daybreak they will not know that a prisoner  has escaped  they will not trouble to count       i cannot believe it possible they will carry out such a butchery   rujub       we shall see  sahib  i did not tell you all i knew lest we should fail  to carry off the lady  but i know the orders that have been given  word  has been sent round to the butchers of the town  and tomorrow morning  soon after daybreak it will be done      bathurst gave an exclamation of horror  for until now he had hardly  believed it was possible that even nana sahib could perpetrate so  atrocious a massacre  not another word was spoken until they entered the  wood      where is the river  rujub       a few hundred yards to the left  sahib  the road is half a mile to the  right  we shall be quite safe here      they made their way for some little distance into the wood  and then  laid down their burden     they had taken to the spot where rabda remained when the others went  forward towards the prison a basket containing food and three bottles of  wine  and this rujub had carried since they started together  as soon as  the hammock was lowered to the ground  isobel moved and sat up      i am rested now  oh  how good you have all been  i was just going to  tell you that i could walk again  i am quite ready to go on now       we are going to halt here till tomorrow evening  miss hannay  rujub  thinks we are quite beyond any risk of pursuit now  you must first  eat and drink something  and then sleep as long as you can  rabda has  brought a native dress for you and dye for staining your skin  but there  is no occasion for doing that till tomorrow  the river is only a short  distance away  and in the morning you will be able to enjoy a wash      the neck was knocked off a bottle  rabda had brought in the basket a  small silver cup  and isobel  after drinking some wine and eating a few  mouthfuls of food  lay down by her and was soon fast asleep  bathurst  ate a much more hearty meal  rujub and his daughter said that they did  not want anything before morning     the sun was high before bathurst woke  rujub had lighted a fire  and was  boiling some rice in a lota      where is miss hannay   bathurst asked  as he sat up      she has gone down to the river with rabda  the trees hang down well  over the water  and they can wash without fear of being seen on the  opposite shore  i was going to wake you when the lady got up  but she  made signs that you were to be allowed to sleep on      in half an hour the two girls returned  isobel was attired in a native  dress  and her face  neck  arms  feet  and ankles had been stained to  the same color as rabda s  she came forward a little timidly  for she  felt strange and uncomfortable in her scanty attire  bathurst gave an  exclamation of pain as he saw her face      how dreadfully  you have burnt yourself  miss hannay  surely you cannot  have followed the instructions i gave you       no  it is not your fault at all  mr  bathurst  i put a great deal more  on than you said  but i was so anxious to disfigure myself that i was  determined to do it thoroughly  but it is nothing to what it was  as you  see  my lips are getting all right again  and the sores are a good deal  better than they were  i suppose they will leave scars  but that won t  trouble me       it is the pain you must have suffered that i am thinking of   he  replied   as to the scars  i hope they will wear out in time  you must  indeed have suffered horribly       they burnt dreadfully for a time   the girl answered   but for the last  two or three days i have hardly felt it  though  of course  it is very  sore still       do you feel ready for breakfast  miss hannay       quite ready  and for a walk as long as you like afterwards  i feel  quite another creature after my dip  that was one of the worst things  in the prison  we had scarcely water enough to drink  and none to wash  with  and  of course  no combs nor anything      they sat down together and ate the cold food they had brought  while  rabda and her father made their breakfast of rice      what has become of mr  wilson   isobel asked suddenly   i wondered  about him as i was being carried along last night  but i was too tired  to talk afterwards       i hope he is either safe at allahabad by this time  or is with the  troops marching up  the zemindar s son  who came down with us as an  escort  and one of his men got safely to shore also  and they went on  with wilson  when he found i was going to stay at cawnpore to try and  rescue you  he pleaded very hard that i should keep him with me in order  that he might share in the attempt  but his ignorance of the language  might have been fatal  and his being with me would have greatly added  to the difficulty  so i was obliged to refuse him  it was only because  i told him that instead of adding to  he would lessen your chance of  escape  that he consented to go  for i am sure he would willingly have  laid down his life to save yours       i am very glad he is safe  he is very kind hearted and nice  mr   bathurst  and a thoroughly natural  unaffected young fellow  very loyal  and stanch  i am quite sure he would have done anything he could  even  at the risk of his life       i like him very much  too  miss hannay  before the siege i thought him  a careless  happy go lucky lad  but as i got to know him well  i found  he was much more than that  and he will make a good man and an excellent  officer one of these days if he is spared  he is thoroughly brave  without the slightest brag  an excellent specimen of the best class of  public school boy       and who are the troops coming up  mr  bathurst  how strong are they  i  have heard nothing about them       about twelve hundred white troops and four or five hundred sikhs  at  least that is what the natives put them at       but surely they will never be able to fight their way to cawnpore   where there are the mutineers and nana sahib s troops and the oude men  and the people of the town  why  there must be ten to one against them       not far short of that  i think  but i feel sure our men will do it   they know of the treachery of the nana  they know of the massacre by the  river  and they know that the women and children are prisoners in his  hands  and do you think that men who know these things can be beaten   the sepoys met them in superior force and in a strong position at  futtehpore  and they drove them before them like chaff  they will have  harder work next time  but i have no shadow of fear of the result      then their talk went back to deennugghur and of their friends there  the  doolans  the hunters  the rintouls  and others  and isobel wept freely  over their fate      next to my uncle i shall miss the doctor   she said      he was an awfully good fellow   bathurst said   and was the only real  friend i have had since i came to india  i would have done anything for  him       when shall we start   isobel asked presently      directly the sun goes down a little  you would find it terribly hot  now  i have been talking it over with rujub  and he says it is better  not to make a long journey today  we are not more than twenty miles from  dong  and it would not do to move in that direction until we know how  things have gone  therefore  if we start at three o clock and walk till  seven or eight  it will be quite far enough       he seems a wonderful man   said isobel   you remember that talk we had  at dinner  before we went to see him at the hunters       yes   he said   as you know  i was a believer then  and so was the  doctor  i need not say that i believe still more now that these men do  wholly unaccountable feats  he put the sentry outside the walls of your  prison and five out of your eight warders so sound asleep that they did  not wake during the struggle i had with the others  that  of course   was mesmerism  his messages to you were actually sent by means of his  daughter  she was put in a sort of trance  in which she saw you and told  us what you were doing  and communicated the message her father gave her  to you  he could not send you a message nor tell me about you when you  were first at bithoor  because he said rabda was not in sympathy with  you  but after she had seen you and touched you and you had kissed her   she was able to do so  there does not appear to me to be anything beyond  the powers of nature in that  though doubtless powers were called into  play of which at present we know nothing  but we do know that minds act  upon each other  possibly certain persons in sympathy with each other  may be able to act upon each other from a distance  especially when  thrown into the sort of trance which is known as the clairvoyant state   i always used to look upon that as humbug  but i need hardly say i shall  in future be ready to believe almost anything  he professes to have  other and even greater powers than what we have seen  at any rate  he  can have no motive in deceiving me when he has risked his life to help  me  do you know  rabda offered to go into the prison  her father could  have got her an order to pass in  and then to let you go out in her  dress while she remained in your stead  i could not accept the sacrifice  even to save you  and i was sure had i done so you yourself would have  refused to leave       of course  but how good of her  please tell her that you have told me   and how grateful i am for her offer      bathurst called rabda  who was sitting a short distance away     she took the hand that isobel held out to her and placed it against her  forehead      my life is yours  sahib   she said simply to bathurst   it was right  that i should give it for this lady you love       what does she say   isobel asked      she says that she owed me her life for that tiger business  you know   and was ready to give it for you because i had set my mind on saving  you       is that what she really said  mr  bathurst   isobel asked quietly  for  he had hesitated a little in changing its wording      that was the sense of it  i can assure you  not only was she ready  to make the sacrifice  but her father consented to her doing so  these  hindoos are capable of gratitude  you see  there are not many english  who would be ready thus to sacrifice themselves for a man who had  accidentally  as i may say  saved their lives       not accidentally  mr  bathurst  why do you always try to run yourself  down  i suppose you will say next you saved my life by an accident       the saving of your life is due chiefly to these natives       but they were only your instruments  mr  bathurst  they had no interest  in saving me  you had bought their services at the risk of your life   and in saving me they were paying that debt to you      at three o clock they prepared for the start  bathurst had exchanged the  warder s dress for one of a peasant  which they had brought with them   the woods were of no great width  and rujub said they had better follow  the road now      no one will suspect us of being anything but what we seem   he said    should we meet any peasants  their talk will be with you and me  they  will ask no questions about the women  but if there is a woman among  them  and she speaks  rabda will answer her      for hours they had heard dull sounds in the air  which bathurst had  recognized at once as distant artillery  showing that the fight was  going on near dong      the sepoys are making a stout resistance  or the firing would not last  so long   he said to rujub  as they walked through the wood towards the  road      they have two positions to defend  sahib  the nana s men will fight  first at a strong village two miles beyond dong  if they are beaten  there  they will fight again at the bridge i told you of       that would partly account for it  but the sepoys must be fighting much  better than they did at futtehpore  for there  as you said  the white  troops swept the sepoys before them      when they reached the edge of the wood bathurst said   i will see that  the road is clear before we go out  if anyone saw us issuing out of the  wood they might wonder what we had been after      he went to the edge of the bushes and looked down the long straight  road  there was only a solitary figure in sight  it seemed to be an old  man walking lame with a stick  bathurst was about to turn and tell the  others to come out  when he saw the man stop suddenly  turn round to  look back along the road  stand with his head bent as if listening  then  run across the road with much more agility than he had before seemed to  possess  and plunge in among the trees      wait   he said to those behind him   something is going on  a peasant i  saw in the road has suddenly dived into the wood as if he was afraid of  being pursued  ah   he exclaimed a minute later   there is a party of  horsemen coming along at a gallop  get farther back into the wood      presently they heard the rapid trampling of horses  and looking through  the bushes they saw some twenty sowars of one of the native cavalry  regiments dash past     bathurst went to the edge of the wood again  and looked out  then he  turned suddenly to isobel      you remember those pictures on the smoke   he said excitedly      no  i do not remember them   she said  in surprise   i have often  wondered at it  but i have never been able to recollect what they were  since that evening  i have often thought they were just like dreams   where one sees everything just as plainly as if it were a reality  and  then go out of your mind altogether as soon as you are awake       it has been just the same with me   replied bathurst   except that once  or twice they have come back for a moment quite vividly  one of them  i have not thought of for some days  but now i see it again  don t you  remember there was a wood  and a hindoo man and woman stepped out of it   and a third native came up to them       yes  i remember now   she said eagerly   it was just as we are here   but what of that  mr  bathurst       did you recognize any of them       yes  yes  it all comes back to me now  it was you and the doctor   certainly  and i thought the woman was myself  i spoke to the doctor  next day about it  but he laughed at it all  and i have never thought of  it since       the doctor and i agreed  when we talked it over that evening  that the  hindoo who stepped out of the wood was myself  and thought that you were  the hindoo girl  but of that we were not so sure  for your face seemed  not only darkened  but blotched and altered  it was just as you are  now  and the third native was the doctor himself  we both felt certain  of that  it has come true  and i feel absolutely certain that the native  i saw along the road will turn out to be the doctor       oh  i hope so  i hope so   the girl cried  and pressed forward with  bathurst to the edge of the wood     the old native was coming along on the road again  as he approached  his  eye fell on the two figures  and with a hindoo salutation he was passing  on  when isobel cried   it is the doctor   and rushing forward she threw  her arms round his neck      isobel hannay   he cried in delight and amazement   my dear little  girl  my dear little girl  thank god you are saved  but what have you  been doing with yourself  and who is this with you       you knew me when you saw me in the picture on the smoke  doctor    bathurst said  grasping his hand   though you do not know me in life       you  too  bathurst   the doctor exclaimed  as he wrung his hand   thank  god for that  my dear boy  to think that both of you should have been  saved  it seems a miracle  the picture on the smoke  yes  we were  speaking of it that last night at deennugghur  and i never have thought  of it since  is there anyone else       my friend the juggler and his daughter are with us  doctor       then i can understand the miracle   the doctor said   for i believe  that fellow could take you through the air and carry you through stone  walls with a wave of his hand       well  he has not exactly done that  but he and his daughter have  rendered us immense service  i could have done nothing without them      the two natives  seeing through the bushes the recognition that had  taken place  had now stepped forward and salaamed as the doctor spoke a  few hearty words to them      but where have you sprung from  doctor  how were you saved       i jumped overboard when those scoundrels opened fire   the doctor said    i kept my wits about me  and said to myself that if i were to swim for  the opposite shore the chances were that i should get shot down  so i  made a long dive  came up for air  and then went down again  and came up  the next time under some bushes by the bank  there i remained all night   the villains were only a few yards away  and i could hear every word  they said  i heard the boat come ashore  and although i could have done  no good by rushing out  i think i should have done so if i had had any  weapon about me  and have tried to kill one or two of them before i went  down  as it was  i waited until morning  then i heard the rumble of the  guns and the wagons  and knew that they were off  i waited for another  hour to make sure  and then stepped ashore  i went to the boat lying  by the bank  when i saw that isobel and the other two ladies were not  there  i knew that they must have been carried off into cawnpore  i  waited there until night  and then made my way to a peasant s house  a mile out of the town  i had operated upon him for elephantiasis two  years ago  and the man had shown himself grateful  and had occasionally  sent me in little presents of fowls and so on  he received me well  gave  me food  which i wanted horribly  stained my skin  and rigged me out in  this disguise  the next morning i went into the town  and for the last  four or five days have wandered about there  there was nothing i could  do  and yet i felt that i could not go away  but must stay within sight  of the prison where you were all confined till our column arrived   but this morning i determined to come down to join our people who are  fighting their way up  little thinking that i should light upon you by  the way       we were just going to push on  doctor  but as you have had a good long  tramp already  we will stop here until tomorrow morning  if you like       no  no  let us go on  bathurst  i would rather be on the move  and you  can tell me your story as we go          chapter xxii       bathurst knew the doctor well  and perceived that glad as he was to have  met them  he was yet profoundly depressed in spirits  this  added to the  fact that he had left cawnpore that morning  instead of waiting as he  had intended  convinced bathurst that what he dreaded had taken place   he waited until isobel stopped for a moment  that rabda might rearrange  the cloth folded round her in its proper draping  then he said quickly    i heard yesterday what was intended  doctor  is it possible that it has  been done       it was done this morning       what  all  surely not all  doctor       every soul  every woman and child  think of it  the fiends  the devils   the native brought me the news  if i had heard it in the streets of  cawnpore i should have gone mad and seized a sword and run amuck  as it  was  i was well nigh out of mind  i could not stay there  the man would  have sheltered me until the troops came up  but i was obliged to be  moving  so i started down  hush  here comes isobel  we must keep it from  her       now  isobel   he went on  as the girl joined them  and they all started  along the road   tell me how it is i find you here       mr  bathurst must tell you  doctor  i cannot talk about it yet  i can  hardly think about it       well  bathurst  let us hear it from you       it is a painful story for me to have to tell      isobel looked up in surprise      painful  mr  bathurst  i should have thought    and she stopped      not all painful  miss hannay  but in parts  i would rather tell  you  doctor  when we have finished our journey this evening  if your  curiosity will allow you to wait so long       i will try to wait   the doctor replied   though i own it is a trial   now  isobel  you have not told me yet what has happened to your face   let me look at it closer  child  i see your arms are bad  too  what on  earth has happened to you         i burnt myself with acid  doctor  mr  bathurst will tell you all about  it       bless me  mystery seems to thicken  well  you have got yourself into a  pretty pickle  why  child  burns of that sort leave scars as bad as if  you had been burnt by fire  you ought to be in a dark room with your  face and hands bandaged  instead of tramping along here in the sun       i have some lotions and some ointment  doctor  i have used them  regularly since it was done  and the places don t hurt me much now       no  they look healthy enough   he said  examining them closely    granulation is going on nicely  but i warn you you will be disfigured  for months  and it may be years before you get rid of the scars  i  doubt  indeed  if you will ever get rid of them altogether  well  well   what shall we talk about       i will take pity on you  doctor  i will walk on ahead with rabda and  her father  and mr  bathurst can then tell you his story       that will be the best plan  my dear  now then  bathurst  fire away   he  said  when the others had gone on thirty or forty yards ahead      well  doctor  you remember that you were forward talking to the young  zemindar  and i was sitting aft by the side of miss hannay  when they  opened fire       i should think i do remember it   the doctor said   and i am not likely  to forget it if i live to be a hundred  well  what about that       i jumped overboard   bathurst said  laying his hand impressively  upon the doctor s shoulder   i gave a cry  i know i did  and i jumped  overboard      the doctor looked at him in astonishment      well  so did i  like a shot  but what do you say it in that tone for   of course you jumped overboard  if you hadn t you would not be here  now       you don t understand me  doctor   bathurst said gloomily   i was  sitting there next to isobel hannay  the woman i loved  we were talking  in low tones  and i don t know why  but at that moment the mad thought  was coming into my mind that  after all  she cared for me  that in spite  of the disgrace i had brought upon myself  in spite of being a coward   she might still be mine  and as i was thinking this there came the  crash of a cannon  can it be imagined possible that i jumped up like  a frightened hare  and without a thought of her  without a thought of  anything in my mad terror  jumped overboard and left her behind to her  fate  if it had not been that as soon as i recovered my senses  i was  hit on the head just as i landed  and knew nothing of what happened  until i found myself in the bushes with young wilson by my side  the  thought occurred to me that i would rescue her or die in the attempt  i  would have blown out my brains       but  bless my heart  bathurst   the doctor said earnestly   what else  could you have done  why  i jumped overboard without stopping to think   and so did everyone else who had power to do so  no doubt  what good  could you have done if you had stayed  what good would it have done to  the girl if you had been killed  why  if you had been killed  she would  now be lying mangled and dead with the others in that ghastly prison   you take too morbid a view of this matter altogether       there was no reason why you should not have jumped overboard  doctor   nor the others  don t you see i was with the woman i loved  i might have  seized her in my arms and jumped overboard with her  and swam ashore  with her  or i might have stayed and died with her  i thought of my own  wretched life  and i deserted her       my dear bathurst  you did not think of your life  i don t think any  of us stopped to think of anything  but  constituted as you are  the  impulse must have been overpowering  it is nonsense your taking this  matter to heart  why  man  if you had stopped  you would have been  murdered when the boat touched the shore  and do you think it would have  made her happier to have seen you killed before her eyes  if you had  swam ashore with her  the chances are she would have been killed by that  volley of grape  for i saw eight or ten bodies lying on the sands  and  you yourself were  you say  hit  you acted upon impulse  i grant  but  it was upon a wise impulse  you did the very best thing that could have  been done  and your doing so made it possible that isobel hannay should  be rescued from what would otherwise have been certain death       it has turned out so  doctor   bathurst said gloomily   and i thank god  that she is saved  but that does not alter the fact that i  an english  gentleman by birth  thought only of myself  and left the woman i loved   who was sitting by my side  to perish  but do not let us talk any more  about it  it is done and over  there is an end of it  now i will tell  you the story      the doctor listened silently until he heard of isobel s being taken to  bithoor   the atrocious villain   he exclaimed   i have been lamenting  the last month that i never poisoned the fellow  and now  but go on  go  on  how on earth did you get her away      bathurst told the whole story  interrupted by many exclamations of  approval by the doctor  especially when he learned why isobel disfigured  herself      well done   he exclaimed   i always knew that she was a plucky girl   and it needed courage  i can tell you  to burn herself as she has  done  to say nothing of risking spoiling her beauty for life  no slight  sacrifice for a woman      bathurst passed lightly over his fight in the courtyard  but the doctor  questioned him as to the exact facts      not so bad for a coward  bathurst   he said dryly      there was no noise   bathurst said   if they had had pistols  and had  used them  it might have been different  heaven knows  but i don t think  that then  with her life at stake  i should have flinched  i had made  up my mind they would have pistols  but i hope  i think that my nerves  would not have given way then       i am sure they wouldn t  bathurst  well  go on with your story       well  how did you feel then   he asked  when bathurst described how the  guard rushed in through the gate firing   for it is the noise  and not  the danger  that upsets you       i did not even think of it   bathurst said  in some surprise   now you  mention it  i am astonished that i was not for a minute paralyzed  as  i always am  but i did not feel anything of the sort  they rushed in  firing as i told you  and directly they had gone i took her hand and we  ran out together       i think it quite possible  bathurst  that your nervousness may have  gone forever  now that once you have heard guns fired close to you  without your nerves giving way as usual  it is quite possible that  you might do so again  i don t say that you would  but it is possible   indeed it seems to me to be probable  it may be that the sudden shock  when you jumped into the water  acting upon your nerves when in a state  of extreme tension  may have set them right  and that bullet graze  along the top of the skull may have aided the effect of the shock  men  frequently lose their nerve after a heavy fall from a horse  or a sudden  attack by a tiger  or any other unexpected shock  it may be that with  you it has had the reverse consequence       i hope to god that it may be so  doctor   bathurst said  with deep  earnestness   it is certainly extraordinary i should not have felt  it when they fired within a few feet of my head  if we get down to  allahabad i will try  i will place myself near a gun when it is going to  be fired  and if i stand that i will come up again and join this column  as a volunteer  and take part in the work of vengeance  if i can but  once bear my part as a man  they are welcome to kill me in the next  engagement       pooh  pooh  man  you are not born to be killed in battle  after making  yourself a target on the roof at deennugghur  and jumping down in the  middle of the sepoys in the breach  and getting through that attack in  the boats  i don t think you are fated to meet your end with a bullet   well  now let us walk on  and join the others  isobel must be wondering  how much longer we are going to talk together  she cannot exchange a  word with the natives  it must be dull work for her  she is a great  deal thinner than she was before these troubles came on  you see how  differently she walks  she has quite lost that elastic step of hers  but  i dare say that is a good deal due to her walking with bare feet instead  of in english boots  boots have a good deal to do with a walk  look at  the difference between the walk of a gentleman who has always worn well  fitting boots and that of a countryman who has gone about in thick iron  shod boots all his life  breeding goes for something  no doubt  and  alters a man s walk just as it alters a horse s gait      bathurst could not help laughing at the doctor dropping into his usual  style of discussing things      are your feet feeling tender  isobel   the latter asked cheerfully  as  he overtook those in front      no  doctor   she said  with a smile   i don t know that i was ever  thankful for dust before  but i am now  it is so soft that it is like  walking on a carpet  but  of course  it feels very strange       you have only to fancy  my dear  that you are by the seaside  walking  down from your bathing machine across the sands  once get that in your  mind and you will get perfectly comfortable       it requires too great a stretch of the imagination  doctor  to think  for a moment  in this sweltering heat  that i am enjoying a sea breeze  on our english coast  it is silly  of course  to give it even a thought   when one is accustomed to see almost every woman without shoes  i think  i should mind it more than i do if my feet were not stained  i don t  know why  but i should  but please don t talk about it  i try to forget  it  and to fancy that i am really a native      they met but few people on the road  those they did meet passed them  with the usual salutation  there was nothing strange in a party of  peasants passing along the road  they might have been at work at  cawnpore  and be now returning to their native village to get away from  the troubles there  after it became dark they went into a clump of trees  half a mile distant from a village they could see along the road      i will go in   rujub said   and bring some grain  and hear what the  news is      he returned in an hour   the english have taken dong   he said   the  news came in two hours ago  there has been some hard fighting  the  sepoys resisted stoutly at the village  even advancing beyond the  inclosures to meet the british  they were driven back by the artillery  and rifle fire  but held the village for some time before they were  turned out  there was a stand made at the pandoo bridge  but it was a  short one  the force massed there fell back at once when the british  infantry came near enough to rush forward at the charge  and in their  hurry they failed to blow up the bridge      a consultation was held as to whether they should try to join the  british  but it was decided that as the road down to allahabad would be  rendered safe by their advance  it would be better to keep straight on     the next day they proceeded on their journey  walking in the early  morning  halting as soon as the sun had gained much power  and going on  again in the cool of the evening  after three days  walking they reached  the fort of allahabad  it was crowded with ladies who had come in from  the country round  most of the men were doing duty with the garrison   but some thirty had gone up with havelock s column as volunteer cavalry   his force being entirely deficient in that arm     as soon as the doctor explained who they were  they were received with  the greatest kindness  and isobel was at once carried off by the ladies   while bathurst and the doctor were surrounded by an eager group anxious  to hear the state of affairs at cawnpore  and how they had escaped  the  news of the fighting at dong was already known  for on the evening of  the day of the fight havelock had sent down a mounted messenger to say  the resistance was proving so severe that he begged some more troops  might be sent up  as all was quiet now at allahabad  where there had at  first been some fierce fighting  general neil  who was in command there   had placed two hundred and thirty men of the   th regiment in bullock  vans  and had himself gone on with them     the doctor had decided to keep the news of the massacre to himself      they will know it before many hours are over  bathurst   he said   and  were i to tell them  half of them wouldn t believe me  and the other  half would pester my life out with questions  there is never any  occasion to hurry in telling bad news      the first inquiry of bathurst and his friends had been for wilson  and  they found to their great pleasure that he had arrived in safety  and  had gone up with the little body of cavalry  captain forster  whom they  next asked for  had not reached allahabad  and no news had been heard of  him      what are you going to do  rujub   bathurst asked the native next  morning      i shall go to patna   he said   i have friends there  and i shall  remain in the city until these troubles are over  i believe now that you  were right  sahib  although i did not think so when you spoke  and that  the british raj will be restored  i thought  as did the sepoys  that  they were a match for the british troops  i see now that i was wrong   but there is a tremendous task before them  there is all oude and the  northwest to conquer  and fully two hundred thousand men in arms against  them  but i believe that they will do it  they are a great people  and  now i do not wish it otherwise  this afternoon i shall start      the doctor  who had found many acquaintances in allahabad  had no  difficulty in obtaining money from the garrison treasury  and bathurst  and isobel purchased the two handsomest bracelets they could obtain from  the ladies in the fort as a souvenir for rabda  and gave them to her  with the heartiest expressions of their deep gratitude to her and her  father      i shall think of you always  rabda   isobel said   and shall be  grateful to the end of my life for the kindness that you have done us   your father has given us your address at patna  and i shall write to you  often       i shall never forget you  lady  and even the black water will not quite  separate us  as i knew how you were in prison  so i shall know how you  are in your home in england  what we have done is little  did not the  sahib risk his life for me  my father and i will never forget what we  owe him  i am glad to know that you will make him happy      this was said in the room that had been allotted to isobel  an ayah of  one of the ladies in the fort acting as interpreter  the girl had woke  up in the morning flushed and feverish  and the doctor  when sent for   told her she must keep absolutely quiet      i am afraid i am going to have her on my hands for a bit   he said to  bathurst   she has borne the strain well  but she looks to me as if she  was going to have a smart attack of fever  it is well that we got her  here before it showed itself  you need not look scared  it is just the  reaction  if it had been going to be brain fever or anything of that  sort  i should have expected her to break down directly you got her out   no  i don t anticipate anything serious  and i am sure i hope that it  won t be so  i have put my name down to go up with the next batch of  volunteers  doctors will be wanted at the front  and i hope to have a  chance of wiping out my score with some of those scoundrels  however   though i think she is going to be laid up  i don t fancy it will last  many days      that afternoon a messenger from havelock brought down the terrible news  that they had fought their way to cawnpore  only to find that the whole  of the ladies and children in the subada ke kothee had been massacred   and their bodies thrown down a well  the grief and indignation caused by  the news were terrible  scarce one but had friends among the prisoners   women wept  men walked up and down  wild with fury at being unable to do  aught at present to avenge the massacre      what are you going to do  bathurst   the doctor asked that evening   i  suppose you have some sort of plan       i do not know yet  in the first place  i want to try whether what you  said the other day is correct  and if i can stand the noise of firing  without flinching       we can t try here in the fort   the doctor said  full of interest  in the experiment   a musket shot would throw the whole garrison into  confusion  and at present no one can go far from the gate  however   there may be a row before long  and then you will have an opportunity  of trying  if there is not  we will go out together half a mile or so as  soon as some more troops get up  you said  when we were talking about it  at deennugghur  you should resign your appointment and go home  but if  you find your nerves are all right you may change your mind about that   how about the young lady in there       well  doctor  i should say that you  as her father s friend  are the  person to make arrangements for her  just at present travel is not very  safe  but i suppose that directly things quiet down a little many of the  ladies will be going down to the coast  and no doubt some of them would  take charge of miss hannay back to england       and you mean to have nothing to say in the matter       nothing at all   he said firmly   i have already told you my views on  the subject       well  then   the doctor said hotly   i regard you as an ass   and  without another word he walked off in great anger     for the next four or five days isobel was in a high state of fever  it  passed off as the doctor had predicted it would do  but left her very  weak and languid  another week and she was about again      what is mr  bathurst going to do   she asked the doctor the first day  she was up on a couch      i don t know what he is going to do  my dear   he said irritably   my  opinion of bathurst is that he is a fool       oh  doctor  how can you say so   she exclaimed in astonishment   why   what has he done       it isn t what he has done  but what he won t do  my dear  here he is in  love with a young woman in every way suitable  and who is ready to say  yes whenever he asks her  and he won t ask  and is not going to ask   because of a ridiculous crotchet he has got in his head      isobel flushed and then grew pale      what is the crotchet   she asked  in a low tone  after being silent for  some time      what do you think  my dear  he is more disgusted with himself than  ever       not about that nervousness  surely   isobel said   after all he has  done and the way he has risked his life  surely that cannot be troubling  him       it is  my dear  not so much on the general as on a particular ground   he insists that by jumping out of the boat when that fire began  he has  done for himself altogether       but what could he have done  doctor       that s what i ask him  my dear  he insists that he ought to either have  seized you and jumped overboard with you  in which case you would both  probably have been killed  as i pointed out to him  or else stayed  quietly with you by your side  in which case  as i also pointed out  to him  you would have had the satisfaction of seeing him murdered  he  could not deny that this would have been so  but that in no way alters  his opinion of his own conduct  i also ventured to point out to him that  if he had been killed  you would at this moment be either in the power  of that villainous nana  or be with hundreds of others in that ghastly  well at cawnpore  i also observed to him that i  who do not regard  myself as a coward  also jumped overboard from your boat  and that  wilson  who is certainly a plucky young fellow  and a number of others   jumped over from the other boat  but i might as well have talked to a  post      isobel sat for some time silent  her fingers playing nervously with each  other      of course it seems foolish of him to think of it so strongly  but i  don t think it is unnatural he should feel as he does       may i ask why   the doctor said sarcastically      i mean  doctor  it would be foolish of other people  but i don t think  it is foolish of him  of course he could have done no good staying in  the boat  he would have simply thrown away his life  and yet i think   i feel sure  that there are many men who would have thrown away their  lives in such a case  even at that moment of terror i felt a pang  when   without a word  he sprang overboard  i thought of it many times that  long night  in spite of my grief for my uncle and the others  and my  horror of being a prisoner in the hands of the sepoys  i did not blame  him  because i knew how he must have felt  and that it was done in a  moment of panic  i was not so sorry for myself as for him  for i knew  that if he escaped  the thought of that moment would be terrible for  him  i need not say that in my mind the feeling that he should not  have left me so has been wiped out a thousand times by what he did  afterwards  by the risk he ran for me  and the infinite service he  rendered me by saving me from a fate worse than death  but i can enter  into his feelings  most men would have jumped over just as he did  and  would never have blamed themselves even if they had at once started away  down the country to save their own lives  much less if they had stopped  to save mine as he has done      but who can wonder that he is more sensitive than others  did he not  hear from you that i said that a coward was contemptible  did not all  the men except you and my uncle turn their backs upon him and treat him  with contempt  in spite of his effort to meet his death by standing up  on the roof  think how awfully he must have suffered  and then  when it  seemed that his intervention  which saved our lives  had to some extent  won him back the esteem of the men around him  that he should so fail  again  as he considers  and that with me beside him  no wonder that he  takes the view he does  and that he refuses to consider that even the  devotion and courage he afterwards showed can redeem what he considers  is a disgrace  you always said that he was brave  doctor  and i believe  now there is no braver man living  but that makes it so much the worse  for him  a coward would be more than satisfied with himself for what he  did afterwards  and would regard it as having completely wiped out any  failing  while he magnifies the failing  such as it was  and places but  small weight on what he afterwards did  i like him all the better for  it  i know the fault  if fault it was  and i thought it so at the time   was one for which he was not responsible  and yet i like him all the  better that he feels it so deeply       well  my dear  you had better tell him so   the doctor said dryly   i  really agree with what you say  and you make an excellent advocate  i  cannot do better than leave the matter in your hands  you know  child    he said  changing his tone   i have from the first wished for bathurst  and you to come together  and if you don t do so i shall say you are  the most wrong headed young people i ever met  he loves you  and i don t  think there is any question about your feelings  and you ought to make  matters right somehow  unfortunately  he is a singularly pig headed man  when he gets an idea in his mind  however  i hope that it will come all  right  by the way  he asked were you well enough to see him today       i would rather not see him till tomorrow   the girl said      and i think too that you had better not see him until tomorrow  isobel   your cheeks are flushed now  and your hands are trembling  and i do not  want you laid up again  so i order you to keep yourself perfectly quiet  for the rest of the day      but it was not till two days later that bathurst came up to see her     the spies brought in  late that evening  the news that a small party of  the sepoy cavalry  with two guns  were at a village three miles on the  other side of the town  and were in communication with the disaffected   it was decided at once by the officer who had succeeded general neil  in the command of the fort that a small party of fifty infantry   accompanied by ten or twelve mounted volunteers  should go out and  attack them  bathurst sent in his name to form one of the party as soon  as he learned the news  borrowing the horse of an officer who was laid  up ill     the expedition started two hours before daybreak  and  making a long  detour  fell upon the sepoys at seven o clock  the latter  who had  received news half an hour before of their approach  made a stand   relying on their cannon  the infantry  however  moved forward in  skirmishing order  their fire quickly silenced the guns  and they then  rushed forward while the little troop of volunteers charged     the fight lasted but a few minutes  at the end of which time the enemy  galloped off in all directions  leaving their guns in the hands of the  victors  four of the infantry had been killed by the explosion of a well  aimed shell  and five of the volunteers were wounded in the hand to hand  fight with the sowars  the sepoys  guns and artillery horses had been  captured     the party at once set out on their return  on their way they had some  skirmishing with the rabble of the town  who had heard the firing  but  they were beaten off without much difficulty  and the victors re entered  the fort in triumph  the doctor was at the gate as they came in   bathurst sprang from his horse and held out his hand  his radiant face  told its own story      thank god  doctor  it has passed  i don t think my pulse went a beat  faster when the guns opened on us  and the crackle of our own musketry  had no more effect  i think it has gone forever       i am glad indeed  bathurst   the doctor said  warmly grasping his hand    i hoped that it might be so       no words can express how grateful i feel   bathurst said   the cloud  that shadowed my life seems lifted  and henceforth i shall be able to  look a man in the face       you are wounded  i see   the doctor said      yes  i had a pistol ball through my left arm  i fancy the bone is  broken  but that is of no consequence       a broken arm is no trifle   the doctor said   especially in a climate  like this  come into the hospital at once and let me see to it      one of the bones of the forearm was indeed broken  and the doctor   having applied splints and bandages  peremptorily ordered him to lie  down  bathurst protested that he was perfectly able to get up with his  arm in a sling      i know you are able   the doctor said testily   but if you were to go  about in this oven  we should very likely have you in a high fever by  tomorrow morning  keep yourself perfectly quiet for today  by tomorrow   if you have no signs of fever  and the wound is doing well  we will see  about it      upon leaving him dr  wade went out and heard the details of the fight      your friend bathurst particularly distinguished himself   the officer  who commanded the volunteers said   he cut down the ressaldar who  commanded the sepoys  and was in the thick of it  i saw him run one  sowar through and shoot another  i am not surprised at his fighting  so well after what you have gone through in deennugghur and in that  cawnpore business      the doctor then went up to see isobel  she looked flushed and excited      is it true  doctor  that mr  bathurst went out with the volunteers  and  that he is wounded       both items are true  my dear  fortunately the wound is not serious  a  ball has broken the small bone of the left forearm  but i don t think it  will lay him up for long  in fact  he objects strongly to go to bed       but how did he  how is it he went out to fight  doctor  i could hardly  believe it when i was told  though of course i did not say so       my dear  it was an experiment  he told me that he did not feel at all  nervous when the sepoys rushed in at the gate firing when he was walking  off with you  and it struck me that possibly the sudden shock and the  jump into the water when they attacked the boats  and that rap on the  head with a musket ball  might have affected his nervous system  and  that he was altogether cured  so he was determined on the first occasion  to try       and did it  doctor   isobel asked eagerly   i don t care  you know  one  bit whether he is nervous when there is a noise or not  but for his sake  i should be glad to know that he has got over it  it has made him so  unhappy       he has got over it  my dear  he went through the fight without feeling  the least nervous  and distinguished himself very much in the charge  as  the officer who commanded his troop has just told me       oh  i am glad  i am thankful  doctor  no words can say how pleased i  am  i know that it would have made his whole life unhappy  and i should  have always had the thought that he remembered those hateful words of  mine       i am as glad as you are  isobel  though i fancy it will change our  plans       how change our plans  doctor  i did not know that i had any plans       i think you had  child  though you might not acknowledge them even  to yourself  my plan was that you should somehow convince him that  in  spite of what you said  and in spite of his leaving you in that boat   you were quite content to take him for better or for worse       how could i tell him that   the girl said  coloring      well  i think you would have had to do so somehow  my dear  but that is  not the question now  my plan was that when you had succeeded in doing  this you should marry him and go home with him       but why  doctor   she asked  coloring even more hotly than before   is  the plan changed       because  my dear  i don t think bathurst will go home with you       why not  doctor   she asked  in surprise      because  my dear  he will want  in the first place  to rehabilitate  himself       but no one knows  doctor  about the siege and what happened there   except you and me and mr  wilson  all the rest have gone       that is true  my dear  but he will want to rehabilitate himself in his  own eyes  and besides  that former affair which first set you against  him  might crop up at any time  other civilians  many of them  have  volunteered in the service  and no man of courage would like to go away  as long as things are in their present state  you will see bathurst will  stay      isobel was silent      i think he will be right   she said at last gravely   if he wishes to  do so  i should not try to dissuade him  it would be very hard to know  that he is in danger  but no harder for me than for others       that is right  my dear   the doctor said affectionately   i should not  wish my little girl  and now the major has gone i feel that you are my  little girl  to think otherwise  i think   he went on  smiling   that  the first part of that plan we spoke of will not be as difficult as  i fancied it would be  the sting has gone  and he will get rid of his  morbid fancies       when shall i be able to see him       well  if i had any authority over him you would not see him for a week   as i have not  i think it likely enough that you will see him tomorrow       i would rather wait if it would do him any harm  doctor       i don t think it will do him any harm  beyond the fact that he will  have to carry his arm in a sling for the next fortnight  i don t think  he will have any trouble with it          chapter xxiii       the next morning bathurst found isobel hannay sitting in a shady court  that had been converted into a sort of general room for the ladies in  the fort      how are you  miss hannay  i am glad to see you down       i might repeat your words  mr  bathurst  for you see we have changed  places  you are the invalid  and not i       there is very little of the invalid about me   he said   i am glad to  see that your face is much better than it was       yes  it is healing fast  i am a dreadful figure still  and the doctor  says that there will be red scars for months  and that probably my face  will be always marked       the doctor is a croaker  miss hannay  there is no occasion to trust  him too implicitly  i predict that there will not be any serious scars  left      he took a seat beside her  there were two or three others in the court   but these were upon the other side  quite out of hearing      i congratulate you  mr  bathurst   she said quietly   on yesterday  the  doctor has  of course  told me all about it  it can make no difference  to us who knew you  but i am heartily glad for your sake  i can  understand how great a difference it must make to you       it has made all the difference in the world   he replied   no one can  tell the load it has lifted from my mind  i only wish it had taken place  earlier       i know what you mean  mr  bathurst  the doctor has told me about that  too  you may wish that you had remained in the boat  but it was well for  me that you did not  you would have lost your life without benefiting  me  i should be now in the well of cawnpore  or worse  at bithoor       that may be   he said gravely   but it does not alter the fact       i have no reason to know why you consider you should have stopped in  the boat  mr  bathurst   she went on quietly  but with a slight flush  on her cheek   i can perhaps guess by what you afterwards did for me  by  the risks you ran to save me  but i cannot go by guesses  i think i have  a right to know       you are making me say what i did not mean to say   he exclaimed  passionately   at least not now  but you do more than guess  you  know  you know that i love you       and what do you know   she asked softly      i know that you ought not to love me   he said   no woman should love a  coward       i quite agree with you  but then i know that you are not a coward       not when i jumped over and left you alone  it was the act of a cur       it was an act for which you were not really responsible  had you been  able to think  you would not have done so  i do not take the view the  doctor does  and i agree with you that a man loving a woman should first  of all think of her and of her safety  so you thought when you could  think  but you were no more responsible for your action than a madman  for a murder committed when in a state of frenzy  it was an impulse  you could not control  had you  after the impulse had passed  come down  here  believing  as you might well have believed  that it was absolutely  impossible to rescue me from my fate  it would have been different  but  the moment you came to yourself you deliberately took every risk  and showed how brave you were when master of yourself  i am speaking  plainly  perhaps more plainly than i ought to  but i should despise  myself had i not the courage to speak out now when so much is at stake   and after all you have done for me      you love me       you know that i love you       and i love you   the girl said   more than that  i honor and esteem  you  i am proud of your love  i am jealous for your honor as for my own   and i hold that honor to be spotless  even now  even with my happiness  at stake  i could not speak so plainly had i not spoken so cruelly and  wrongly before  i did not know you then as i know you now  but having  said what i thought then  i am bound to say what i think now  if only as  a penance  did i hesitate to do so  i should be less grateful than that  poor indian girl who was ready as she said  to give her life for the  life you had saved       had you spoken so bravely but two days since   bathurst said  taking  her hand   i would have said   i love you too well  isobel  to link  your fate to that of a disgraced man   but now i have it in my power to  retrieve myself  to wipe out the unhappy memory of my first failure   and still more  to restore the self respect which i have lost during  the last month  but to do so i must stay here  i must bear part in the  terrible struggle there will be before this mutiny is put down  india  conquered  and cawnpore revenged       i will not try to prevent you   isobel said   i feel it would be wrong  to do so  i could not honor you as i do  if for my sake you turned away  now  even though i knew i should never see you again  i would that you  had died so  than lived with even the shadow of dishonor on your name   i shall suffer  but there are hundreds of other women whose husbands   lovers  or sons are in the fray  and i shall not flinch more than they  do from giving my dearest to the work of avenging our murdered friends  and winning back india      so quietly had they been talking that no thought of how momentous  their conversation had been had entered the minds of the ladies sitting  working but a few paces away  one  indeed  had remarked to another   i  thought when dr  wade was telling us how mr  bathurst had rescued that  unfortunate girl with the disfigured face at cawnpore  that there was  a romance in the case  but i don t see any signs of it  they are goods  friends  of course  but there is nothing lover like in their way of  talking      so thought dr  wade when he came in and saw them sitting there  and gave  vent to his feeling in a grunt of dissatisfaction      it is like driving two pigs to market   he muttered   they won t go the  way i want them to  out of pure contrariness       it is all settled  doctor   bathurst said  rising   come  shake hands   it is to you i owe my happiness chiefly       isobel  my dear  give me a kiss   the doctor exclaimed   i am glad   my dear  i am glad with all my heart  and what have you settled besides  that       we have settled that i am to go home as soon as i can go down country   and he is going up with you and the others to cawnpore       that is right   the doctor said heartily   i told you that was what  he would decide upon  it is right that he should do so  no man ought  to turn his face to the coast till lucknow is relieved and delhi is  captured  i thank god it has all come right at last  i began to be  afraid that bathurst s wrong headedness was going to mar both your  lives      the news had already come down that havelock had found that it would be  absolutely impossible with the small force at his command to fight his  way into lucknow through the multitude of foes that surrounded it  and  that he must wait until reinforcements arrived  there was  therefore  no  urgent hurry  and it was not until ten days later that a second troop  of volunteer horse  composed of civilians unable to resume their duties   and officers whose regiments had mutinied  started for cawnpore     half an hour before they mounted  isobel hannay and ralph bathurst were  married by the chaplain in the fort  this was at bathurst s earnest  wish      i may not return  isobel   he had urged   it is of no use to blink the  fact that we have desperate fighting before us  and i should go into  battle with my mind much more easy in the knowledge that  come what  might  you were provided for  the doctor tells me that he considers you  his adopted daughter  and that he has already drawn up a will leaving  his savings to you  but i should like your future to come from me  dear   even if i am not to share it with you  as you know  i have a fine estate  at home  and i should like to think of you as its mistress      and isobel of course had given way  though not without protest      you don t know what i may be like yet   she said  half laughing  half  in earnest   i may carry these red blotches to my grave       they are honorable scars  dear  as honorable as any gained in battle  i  hope  for your sake  that they will get better in time  but it makes  no difference to me  i know what you were  and how you sacrificed your  beauty  i suppose if i came back short of an arm or leg you would not  make that an excuse for throwing me over       you ought to be ashamed of even thinking of such a thing  ralph       well  dear  i don t know that i did think it  but i am only putting a  parallel case to your own  no  you must consent  it is in all ways best   we will be married on the morning i start  so as just to give time for  our wedding breakfast before i mount       it shall be as you wish   she said softly   you know the estate without  you would be nothing to me  but i should like to bear your name  and  should you never come back to me  ralph  to mourn for you all my life  as my husband  but i believe you will return to me  i think i am getting  superstitious  and believe in all sorts of things since so many strange  events have happened  those pictures on the smoke that came true  rujub  sending you messages at deennugghur  and rabda making me hear her voice  and giving me hope in prison  i do not feel so miserable at the thought  of your going into danger as i should do  if i had not a sort of  conviction that we shall meet again  people believe in presentiments of  evil  why should they not believe in presentiments of good  at any rate   it is a comfort to me that i do feel so  and i mean to go on believing  it       do so  isobel  of course there will be danger  but the danger will  be nothing to that we have passed through together  the sepoys will  no doubt fight hard  but already they must have begun to doubt  their  confidence in victory must be shaken  and they begin to fear retribution  for their crimes  the fighting will  i think  be less severe as the  struggle goes on  and at any rate the danger to us  fighting as the  assailants  is as nothing to that run when we were little groups  surrounded by a country in arms      the news that has come through from lucknow is that  for some time at  any rate  the garrison are confident they can hold out  while at  delhi we know that our position is becoming stronger every day  the  reinforcements are beginning to arrive from england  and though the  work may be slow at first  our army will grow  while their strength will  diminish  until we sweep them before us  i need not stop until the  end  only till the peril is over  till lucknow is relieved  and delhi  captured      as we agreed  i have already sent in my resignation in the service   and shall fight as a volunteer only  if we have to fight our way into  lucknow  cavalry will be useless  and i shall apply to be attached to  one of the infantry regiments  having served before  there will be no  difficulty about that  i think there are sure to be plenty of vacancies   six months will assuredly see the backbone of the rebellion altogether  broken  no doubt it will take much longer crushing it out altogether   for they will break up into scattered bodies  and it may be a long work  before these are all hunted down  but when the strength of the rebellion  is broken  i can leave with honor      there were but few preparations to be made for the wedding  great  interest was felt in the fort in the event  for isobel s rescue from  bithoor and cawnpore  when all others who had fallen into the power of  the nana had perished  had been the one bright spot in the gloom  and  there would have been a general feeling of disappointment had not the  romance had the usual termination     isobel s presents were numerous and of a most useful character  for they  took the form of articles of clothing  and her trousseau was a varied  and extensive one     the doctor said to her the evening before the event   you ought to have  a certificate from the authorities  isobel  saying how you came into  possession of your wardrobe  otherwise when you get back to england you  will very soon come to be looked upon as a most suspicious character       how do you mean  doctor       well  my dear  if the washerwoman to whom you send your assortment  at the end of the voyage is an honest woman  she will probably give  information to the police that you must be a receiver of stolen  property  as your garments are all marked with different names       it will look suspicious  doctor  but i must run the risk of that till  i can remark them again  i can do a good deal that way before i sail  it  is likely we shall be another fortnight at least before we can start  for calcutta  i don t mean to take the old names out  but shall mark my  initials over them and the word  from   then they will always serve as  mementoes of the kindness of everyone here      early on the morning of the wedding a native presented himself at the  gate of the fort  and on being allowed to enter with a letter for miss  hannay of which he was the bearer  handed her a parcel  which proved  to contain a very handsome and valuable set of jewelry  with a slip of  paper on which were the words   from rabda      the doctor was in high spirits at the breakfast to which everybody sat  down directly after the wedding  in the first place  his greatest wish  was gratified  and  in the second  he was about to start to take part in  the work of retribution      one would think you were just starting on a pleasure party  doctor    isobel said      it is worth all the pleasure parties in the world  my dear  i have  always been a hunter  and this time it is human  tigers  i am going in  pursuit of  besides which   he said  in a quieter tone   i hope i am  going to cure as well as kill  i shall only be a soldier when i am not  wanted as a doctor  a man who really loves his profession  as i do  is  always glad to exercise it  and i fear i shall have ample opportunities  that way  besides  dear there is nothing like being cheerful upon an  occasion of this kind  the longer we laugh  the less time there is for  tears      and so the party did not break up until it was nearly time for the  little troop to start  then there was a brief passionate parting  and  the volunteer horse rode away to cawnpore  almost the first person they  met as they rode into the british lines was wilson  who gave a shout of  joy at seeing the doctor and bathurst      my dear bathurst   he exclaimed   then you got safely down  did you  rescue miss hannay       i had that good fortune  wilson       i am glad  i am glad   the young fellow said  shaking his hand  violently  while the tears stood in his eyes   i know you were right  in sending me away  but i have regretted it ever since  i know i should  have been no good  but it seemed such a mean thing for me to go off by  myself  well  doctor  and so you got off too   he went on  turning from  bathurst and wringing the doctor s hand   i never even hoped that you  escaped  i made sure that it was only we two  i have had an awful time  of it since we heard the news  on the way up  of the massacre of the  women  i had great faith in bathurst  and knew that if anything could be  done he would do it  but when i saw the place they had been shut up in   it did not seem really possible that he could have got anyone out of  such a hole  and where did you leave miss hannay       we have not left her at all   the doctor said gravely   there is no  longer a miss hannay  there  man  don t look so shocked  she changed her  name on the morning we came away       what   wilson exclaimed   is she mrs  bathurst  i am glad  bathurst   shake hands again  i felt sure that if you did rescue her that was what  would come of it  i was almost certain by her way when i talked to  her about you one day that she liked you  i was awfully spoony on her  myself  you know  but i knew it was no use  and i would rather by a lot  that she married you than anyone else i know  but come along into my  tent  you know your troop and ours are going to be joined  we have  lost pretty near half our fellows  either in the fights coming up or by  sunstroke or fever since we came here  i got hold of some fizz in the  bazaar yesterday  and i am sure you must be thirsty  this is a splendid  business  i don t know that i ever felt so glad of anything in my life    and he dragged them away to his tent     bathurst found  to his disappointment  that intense as was the desire to  push forward to lucknow  the general opinion was that the general would  not venture to risk his little force in an operation that  with the  means at his disposal  seemed well nigh impossible  cholera had made  considerable ravages  and he had but fifteen hundred bayonets at his  disposal  all that could be done pending the arrival of reinforcements  was to prepare the way for an advance  and show so bold a front that the  enemy would be forced to draw a large force from lucknow to oppose his  advance     a bridge of boats was thrown across the ganges  and the force crossed  the river and advanced to onao  eight miles on the road to lucknow  here  the enemy  strongly posted  barred the way  but they were attacked   and  after hard fighting  defeated  with a loss of three hundred men and  fifteen guns     in this fight the volunteer horse  who had been formed into a single  troop  did good service  one of their two officers was killed  and as  the party last up from allahabad were all full of bathurst s rescue  of miss hannay from cawnpore  and wilson and the doctor influenced the  others  he was chosen to fill the vacancy     there were two other fierce fights out at busserutgunge  and then  bathurst had the satisfaction of advancing with the column against  bithoor  here again the enemy fought sturdily  but were defeated with  great slaughter  and the nana s palace was destroyed     when  after the arrival of outram with reinforcements  the column set  out for lucknow  the volunteers did not accompany them  as they would  have been useless in street fighting  and were  therefore  detailed  to form part of the little force left at cawnpore to hold the city and  check the rebels  parties of whom were swarming round it     the officer in command of the troop died of cholera a few days after  havelock s column started up  and bathurst succeeded him  the work was  very arduous  the men being almost constantly in their saddles   and having frequent encounters with the enemy  they were again much  disappointed at being left behind when sir colin campbell advanced to  the relief of havelock and the garrison  but did more than their share  of fighting in the desperate struggle when the mutineers of the gwallior  contingent attacked the force at cawnpore during the absence of the  relieving column  here they were almost annihilated in a desperate  charge which saved the   th from being cut to pieces at the most  critical moment of the fight     wilson came out of the struggle with the loss of his left arm  and two  or three serious wounds  he had been cut off  and surrounded  and was  falling from his horse when bathurst cut his way to his rescue  and   lifting him into his saddle before him  succeeded after desperate  fighting in carrying him off  himself receiving several wounds  none of  which  however  were severe  the action had been noticed  and bathurst s  name was sent in for the victoria cross  as the troop had dwindled to a  dozen sabers  he applied to sir colin campbell  whose column had arrived  in time to save the force at cawnpore and to defeat the enemy  to be  attached to a regiment as a volunteer  the general  however  at once  offered him a post as an extra aide de camp to himself  as his perfect  knowledge of the language would render him of great use  and he gladly  accepted the offer     with the column returning from lucknow was the doctor      by the way  bathurst   he said on the evening of his return   i met an  old acquaintance in lucknow  you would never guess who it was  forster       you don t say so  doctor       yes  it seems he was hotly pursued  but managed to shake the sowars  off  at that time the garrison was not so closely besieged as it  afterwards was  he knew the country well  and made his way across  it until within sight of lucknow  at night he rode right through the  rebels  swam the river  and gained the residency  he distinguished  himself greatly through the siege  but had been desperately wounded the  day before we marched in  he was in a ward that was handed over to me  directly i got there  and i at once saw that his case was a hopeless  one  the poor fellow was heartily glad to see me  of course he knew  nothing of what had taken place at deennugghur after he had left  and  was very much cut up when he heard the fate of almost all the garrison   he listened quietly when i told how you had rescued isobel and of your  marriage  he was silent  and then said   i am glad to hear it  doctor   i can t say how pleased i am she escaped  bathurst has fairly won her   i never dreamt that she cared for him  well  it seems he wasn t a  coward after all  and you say he has resigned and come up as a volunteer  instead of going home with her  that is plucky  anyhow  well  i am  pleased  i should not have been so if i hadn t been like this  doctor   but now i am out of the running for good  it makes no odds to me either  way  if ever you see him again  you tell him i said i was glad  i expect  he will make her a deucedly better husband than i should have done  i  never liked bathurst  but i expect it was because he was a better fellow  than most of us  that was at school  you know  and of course i did not  take to him at deennugghur  no one could have taken to a man there who  could not stand fire  but you say he has got over that  so that is all  right  anyhow  i have no doubt he will make her happy  tell her i am  glad  doctor  i thought at one time  but that is no odds now  i am glad  you are out of it  too       and then he rambled on about shooting sepoys  and did not say anything  more coherently until late that night  i was sitting by him  he had been  unconscious for some time  and he opened his eyes suddenly and said    tell them both i am glad   and those were the last words he spoke       he was a brave soldier  a fine fellow in many ways   bathurst said   if  he had been brought up differently he would  with all his gifts  have  been a grand fellow  but i fancy he never got any home training  well   i am glad he didn t die as we supposed  without a friend beside him  on  his way to lucknow  and that he fell after doing his duty to the women  and children there      wilson refused to go home after the loss of his arm  and as soon as he  recovered was appointed to one of the sikh regiments  and took part in  the final conquest of lucknow two months after the fight at cawnpore   a fortnight after the conclusion of that terrible struggle sir colin  campbell announced to bathurst that amongst the dispatches that he  had received from home that morning was a gazette  in which his name  appeared among those to whom the victoria cross had been granted      i congratulate you heartily  mr  bathurst   the old officer said   i  have had the pleasure of speaking in the highest terms of the bravery  you displayed in carrying my message through heavy fire a score of times  during the late operations      great as the honor of the victoria cross always is  to bathurst it was  much more than to other men  it was his rehabilitation  he need never  fear now that his courage would be questioned  and the report that he  had before left the army because he lacked courage would be forever  silenced now that he could write v  c  after his name  the pleasure  of dr  wade and wilson was scarcely less than his own  the latter s  regiment had suffered very heavily in the struggle at lucknow  and he  came out of it a captain  having escaped without a wound     a week later bathurst resigned his appointment  there was still much to  be done  and months of marching and fighting before the rebellion was  quite stamped out  but there had now arrived a force ample to overcome  all opposition  and there was no longer a necessity for the service of  civilians  as he had already left the service of the company  he was his  own master  and therefore started at once for calcutta       i shall not be long before i follow you   the doctor said  as they  spent their last evening together   i shall wait and see this out  and  then retire  i should have liked to have gone home with you  but it is  out of the question  our hands are full  and likely to be so for some  time  so i must stop      bathurst stopped for a day at patna to see rujub and his daughter  he  was received as an expected guest  and after spending a few hours with  them he continued his journey  at calcutta he found a letter awaiting  him from isobel  saying that she had arrived safely in england  and  should stay with her mother until his arrival  and there he found her      i expected you today   she said  after the first rapturous greeting  was over   six weeks ago i woke in the middle of the night  and heard  rabda s voice distinctly say   he has been with us today  he is safe and  well  he is on his way to you   as i knew how long you would take  going down from patna  i went the next day to the office and found what  steamer you would catch  and when she would arrive  my mother and sister  both regarded me as a little out of my mind when i said you would be  back this week  they have not the slightest belief in what i told them  about rujub  and insist that it was all a sort of hallucination brought  on by my sufferings  perhaps they will believe now       your face is wonderfully better   he said presently   the marks seem  dying out  and you look almost your old self       yes   she said   i have been to one of the great doctors  and he says  he thinks the scars will quite disappear in time      isobel bathurst has never again received any distinct message from  rabda  but from time to time she has the consciousness  when sitting  quietly alone  that the girl is with her in thought  every year letters  and presents are exchanged  and to the end of their lives she and her  husband will feel that their happiness is chiefly due to her and her  father  rujub  the juggler         the end               cloth of gold   and by consequence was very showy  also uncomfortable   but habit  would soon reconcile me to my clothes  i was aware of that   i was  given the choicest suite of apartments in the castle  after  the king s   they were aglow with loud colored silken hangings   but the stone floors had nothing but rushes on them for a carpet   and they were misfit rushes at that  being not all of one breed   as for conveniences  properly speaking  there weren t any   i mean   little  conveniences  it is the little conveniences that make  the real comfort of life   the big oaken chairs  graced with rude  carvings  were well enough  but that was the stopping place   there was no soap  no matches  no looking glass  except a metal  one  about as powerful as a pail of water   and not a chromo   i had been used to chromos for years  and i saw now that without  my suspecting it a passion for art had got worked into the fabric  of my being  and was become a part of me   it made me homesick  to look around over this proud and gaudy but heartless barrenness  and remember that in our house in east hartford  all unpretending  as it was  you couldn t go into a room but you would find an  insurance chromo  or at least a three color god bless our home  over the door  and in the parlor we had nine   but here  even in  my grand room of state  there wasn t anything in the nature of  a picture except a thing the size of a bedquilt  which was either  woven or knitted  it had darned places in it   and nothing in it  was the right color or the right shape  and as for proportions   even raphael himself couldn t have botched them more formidably   after all his practice on those nightmares they call his  celebrated  hampton court cartoons    raphael was a bird   we had several  of his chromos  one was his  miraculous draught of fishes   where  he puts in a miracle of his own  puts three men into a canoe which  wouldn t have held a dog without upsetting   i always admired  to study r  s art  it was so fresh and unconventional     there wasn t even a bell or a speaking tube in the castle   i had  a great many servants  and those that were on duty lolled in the  anteroom  and when i wanted one of them i had to go and call for him   there was no gas  there were no candles  a bronze dish half full  of boarding house butter with a blazing rag floating in it was  the thing that produced what was regarded as light   a lot of  these hung along the walls and modified the dark  just toned it  down enough to make it dismal   if you went out at night  your  servants carried torches   there were no books  pens  paper or  ink  and no glass in the openings they believed to be windows   it is a little thing  glass is  until it is absent  then it becomes  a big thing   but perhaps the worst of all was  that there wasn t  any sugar  coffee  tea  or tobacco   i saw that i was just another  robinson crusoe cast away on an uninhabited island  with no society  but some more or less tame animals  and if i wanted to make life  bearable i must do as he did  invent  contrive  create  reorganize  things  set brain and hand to work  and keep them busy   well   that was in my line     one thing troubled me along at first  the immense interest which  people took in me   apparently the whole nation wanted a look  at me   it soon transpired that the eclipse had scared the british  world almost to death  that while it lasted the whole country   from one end to the other  was in a pitiable state of panic  and  the churches  hermitages  and monkeries overflowed with praying  and weeping poor creatures who thought the end of the world was  come   then had followed the news that the producer of this awful  event was a stranger  a mighty magician at arthur s court  that he  could have blown out the sun like a candle  and was just going  to do it when his mercy was purchased  and he then dissolved  his enchantments  and was now recognized and honored as the man  who had by his unaided might saved the globe from destruction and  its peoples from extinction   now if you consider that everybody  believed that  and not only believed it  but never even dreamed  of doubting it  you will easily understand that there was not  a person in all britain that would not have walked fifty miles  to get a sight of me   of course i was all the talk  all other  subjects were dropped  even the king became suddenly a person of  minor interest and notoriety   within twenty four hours the  delegations began to arrive  and from that time onward for a fortnight  they kept coming   the village was crowded  and all the countryside   i had to go out a dozen times a day and show myself to these  reverent and awe stricken multitudes   it came to be a great burden   as to time and trouble  but of course it was at the same time  compensatingly agreeable to be so celebrated and such a center  of homage   it turned brer merlin green with envy and spite  which  was a great satisfaction to me   but there was one thing i couldn t  understand  nobody had asked for an autograph   i spoke to clarence  about it   by george   i had to explain to him what it was   then  he said nobody in the country could read or write but a few dozen  priests   land  think of that     there was another thing that troubled me a little   those multitudes  presently began to agitate for another miracle   that was natural   to be able to carry back to their far homes the boast that they  had seen the man who could command the sun  riding in the heavens   and be obeyed  would make them great in the eyes of their neighbors   and envied by them all  but to be able to also say they had seen  him work a miracle themselves  why  people would come a distance  to see  them    the pressure got to be pretty strong   there was  going to be an eclipse of the moon  and i knew the date and hour   but it was too far away   two years   i would have given a good  deal for license to hurry it up and use it now when there was  a big market for it   it seemed a great pity to have it wasted so   and come lagging along at a time when a body wouldn t have any  use for it  as like as not   if it had been booked for only a month  away  i could have sold it short  but  as matters stood  i couldn t  seem to cipher out any way to make it do me any good  so i gave up  trying   next  clarence found that old merlin was making himself  busy on the sly among those people   he was spreading a report that  i was a humbug  and that the reason i didn t accommodate the people  with a miracle was because i couldn t   i saw that i must do  something   i presently thought out a plan     by my authority as executive i threw merlin into prison  the same  cell i had occupied myself   then i gave public notice by herald  and trumpet that i should be busy with affairs of state for  a fortnight  but about the end of that time i would take a moment s  leisure and blow up merlin s stone tower by fires from heaven   in the meantime  whoso listened to evil reports about me  let him  beware   furthermore  i would perform but this one miracle at  this time  and no more  if it failed to satisfy and any murmured   i would turn the murmurers into horses  and make them useful   quiet ensued     i took clarence into my confidence  to a certain degree  and we  went to work privately   i told him that this was a sort of miracle  that required a trifle of preparation  and that it would be sudden  death to ever talk about these preparations to anybody   that made  his mouth safe enough   clandestinely we made a few bushels of  first rate blasting powder  and i superintended my armorers while  they constructed a lightning rod and some wires   this old stone  tower was very massive  and rather ruinous  too  for it was roman   and four hundred years old   yes  and handsome  after a rude  fashion  and clothed with ivy from base to summit  as with a shirt  of scale mail   it stood on a lonely eminence  in good view from  the castle  and about half a mile away     working by night  we stowed the powder in the tower  dug stones  out  on the inside  and buried the powder in the walls themselves   which were fifteen feet thick at the base   we put in a peck  at a time  in a dozen places   we could have blown up the tower  of london with these charges   when the thirteenth night was come  we put up our lightning rod  bedded it in one of the batches of  powder  and ran wires from it to the other batches   everybody  had shunned that locality from the day of my proclamation  but  on the morning of the fourteenth i thought best to warn the people   through the heralds  to keep clear away  a quarter of a mile away   then added  by command  that at some time during the twenty four  hours i would consummate the miracle  but would first give a brief  notice  by flags on the castle towers if in the daytime  by  torch baskets in the same places if at night     thunder showers had been tolerably frequent of late  and i was  not much afraid of a failure  still  i shouldn t have cared for  a delay of a day or two  i should have explained that i was busy  with affairs of state yet  and the people must wait     of course  we had a blazing sunny day  almost the first one without  a cloud for three weeks  things always happen so   i kept secluded   and watched the weather   clarence dropped in from time to time  and said the public excitement was growing and growing all the  time  and the whole country filling up with human masses as far  as one could see from the battlements   at last the wind sprang up  and a cloud appeared  in the right quarter  too  and just at  nightfall   for a little while i watched that distant cloud spread  and blacken  then i judged it was time for me to appear   i ordered  the torch baskets to be lit  and merlin liberated and sent to me   a quarter of an hour later i ascended the parapet and there found  the king and the court assembled and gazing off in the darkness  toward merlin s tower   already the darkness was so heavy that  one could not see far  these people and the old turrets  being  partly in deep shadow and partly in the red glow from the great  torch baskets overhead  made a good deal of a picture     merlin arrived in a gloomy mood   i said      you wanted to burn me alive when i had not done you any harm   and latterly you have been trying to injure my professional  reputation   therefore i am going to call down fire and blow up  your tower  but it is only fair to give you a chance  now if you  think you can break my enchantments and ward off the fires  step  to the bat  it s your innings       i can  fair sir  and i will  doubt it not      he drew an imaginary circle on the stones of the roof  and burnt  a pinch of powder in it  which sent up a small cloud of aromatic  smoke  whereat everybody fell back and began to cross themselves  and get uncomfortable   then he began to mutter and make passes  in the air with his hands   he worked himself up slowly and  gradually into a sort of frenzy  and got to thrashing around with  his arms like the sails of a windmill   by this time the storm had  about reached us  the gusts of wind were flaring the torches and  making the shadows swash about  the first heavy drops of rain  were falling  the world abroad was black as pitch  the lightning  began to wink fitfully   of course  my rod would be loading itself  now   in fact  things were imminent  so i said      you have had time enough   i have given you every advantage   and not interfered   it is plain your magic is weak  it is only  fair that i begin now      i made about three passes in the air  and then there was an awful  crash and that old tower leaped into the sky in chunks  along  with a vast volcanic fountain of fire that turned night to noonday   and showed a thousand acres of human beings groveling on the ground  in a general collapse of consternation   well  it rained mortar and  masonry the rest of the week   this was the report  but probably  the facts would have modified it     it was an effective miracle   the great bothersome temporary  population vanished   there were a good many thousand tracks  in the mud the next morning  but they were all outward bound   if i had advertised another miracle i couldn t have raised an  audience with a sheriff     merlin s stock was flat   the king wanted to stop his wages  he  even wanted to banish him  but i interfered   i said he would be  useful to work the weather  and attend to small matters like that   and i would give him a lift now and then when his poor little  parlor magic soured on him   there wasn t a rag of his tower left   but i had the government rebuild it for him  and advised him  to take boarders  but he was too high toned for that   and as for  being grateful  he never even said thank you   he was a rather  hard lot  take him how you might  but then you couldn t fairly  expect a man to be sweet that had been set back so         chapter viii    the boss    to be vested with enormous authority is a fine thing  but to have  the on looking world consent to it is a finer   the tower episode  solidified my power  and made it impregnable   if any were perchance  disposed to be jealous and critical before that  they experienced  a change of heart  now   there was not any one in the kingdom  who would have considered it good judgment to meddle with my matters     i was fast getting adjusted to my situation and circumstances   for a time  i used to wake up  mornings  and smile at my  dream    and listen for the colt s factory whistle  but that sort of thing  played itself out  gradually  and at last i was fully able to realize  that i was actually living in the sixth century  and in arthur s  court  not a lunatic asylum   after that  i was just as much  at home in that century as i could have been in any other  and  as for preference  i wouldn t have traded it for the twentieth   look at the opportunities here for a man of knowledge  brains   pluck  and enterprise to sail in and grow up with the country   the grandest field that ever was  and all my own  not a competitor   not a man who wasn t a baby to me in acquirements and capacities   whereas  what would i amount to in the twentieth century   i should  be foreman of a factory  that is about all  and could drag a seine  down street any day and catch a hundred better men than myself     what a jump i had made   i couldn t keep from thinking about it   and contemplating it  just as one does who has struck oil   there  was nothing back of me that could approach it  unless it might be  joseph s case  and joseph s only approached it  it didn t equal  it  quite   for it stands to reason that as joseph s splendid  financial ingenuities advantaged nobody but the king  the general  public must have regarded him with a good deal of disfavor  whereas  i had done my entire public a kindness in sparing the sun  and was  popular by reason of it     i was no shadow of a king  i was the substance  the king himself  was the shadow   my power was colossal  and it was not a mere  name  as such things have generally been  it was the genuine  article   i stood here  at the very spring and source of the second  great period of the world s history  and could see the trickling  stream of that history gather and deepen and broaden  and roll  its mighty tides down the far centuries  and i could note the  upspringing of adventurers like myself in the shelter of its long  array of thrones  de montforts  gavestons  mortimers  villierses   the war making  campaign directing wantons of france  and charles  the second s scepter wielding drabs  but nowhere in the procession  was my full sized fellow visible   i was a unique  and glad to know  that that fact could not be dislodged or challenged for thirteen  centuries and a half  for sure   yes  in power i was equal to  the king   at the same time there was another power that was  a trifle stronger than both of us put together   that was the church   i do not wish to disguise that fact   i couldn t  if i wanted to   but never mind about that  now  it will show up  in its proper  place  later on   it didn t cause me any trouble in the beginning    at least any of consequence     well  it was a curious country  and full of interest   and the  people   they were the quaintest and simplest and trustingest race   why  they were nothing but rabbits   it was pitiful for a person  born in a wholesome free atmosphere to listen to their humble  and hearty outpourings of loyalty toward their king and church  and nobility  as if they had any more occasion to love and honor  king and church and noble than a slave has to love and honor  the lash  or a dog has to love and honor the stranger that kicks him   why  dear me   any  kind of royalty  howsoever modified   any  kind  of aristocracy  howsoever pruned  is rightly an insult  but if you  are born and brought up under that sort of arrangement you probably  never find it out for yourself  and don t believe it when somebody  else tells you   it is enough to make a body ashamed of his race  to think of the sort of froth that has always occupied its thrones  without shadow of right or reason  and the seventh rate people  that have always figured as its aristocracies  a company of monarchs  and nobles who  as a rule  would have achieved only poverty and  obscurity if left  like their betters  to their own exertions     the most of king arthur s british nation were slaves  pure and  simple  and bore that name  and wore the iron collar on their  necks  and the rest were slaves in fact  but without the name   they imagined themselves men and freemen  and called themselves  so   the truth was  the nation as a body was in the world for one  object  and one only  to grovel before king and church and noble   to slave for them  sweat blood for them  starve that they might  be fed  work that they might play  drink misery to the dregs that  they might be happy  go naked that they might wear silks and  jewels  pay taxes that they might be spared from paying them   be familiar all their lives with the degrading language and postures  of adulation that they might walk in pride and think themselves  the gods of this world   and for all this  the thanks they got were  cuffs and contempt  and so poor spirited were they that they took  even this sort of attention as an honor     inherited ideas are a curious thing  and interesting to observe  and examine   i had mine  the king and his people had theirs   in both cases they flowed in ruts worn deep by time and habit   and the man who should have proposed to divert them by reason  and argument would have had a long contract on his hands   for  instance  those people had inherited the idea that all men without  title and a long pedigree  whether they had great natural gifts  and acquirements or hadn t  were creatures of no more consideration  than so many animals  bugs  insects  whereas i had inherited the idea  that human daws who can consent to masquerade in the peacock shams  of inherited dignities and unearned titles  are of no good but  to be laughed at   the way i was looked upon was odd  but it was  natural   you know how the keeper and the public regard the elephant  in the menagerie  well  that is the idea   they are full of  admiration of his vast bulk and his prodigious strength  they  speak with pride of the fact that he can do a hundred marvels  which are far and away beyond their own powers  and they speak  with the same pride of the fact that in his wrath he is able  to drive a thousand men before him   but does that make him one  of  them    no  the raggedest tramp in the pit would smile at  the idea   he couldn t comprehend it  couldn t take it in  couldn t  in any remote way conceive of it   well  to the king  the nobles   and all the nation  down to the very slaves and tramps  i was  just that kind of an elephant  and nothing more   i was admired   also feared  but it was as an animal is admired and feared   the animal is not reverenced  neither was i  i was not even  respected   i had no pedigree  no inherited title  so in the king s  and nobles  eyes i was mere dirt  the people regarded me with  wonder and awe  but there was no reverence mixed with it  through  the force of inherited ideas they were not able to conceive of  anything being entitled to that except pedigree and lordship   there you see the hand of that awful power  the roman catholic  church   in two or three little centuries it had converted a nation  of men to a nation of worms   before the day of the church s  supremacy in the world  men were men  and held their heads up   and had a man s pride and spirit and independence  and what  of greatness and position a person got  he got mainly by achievement   not by birth   but then the church came to the front  with an axe  to grind  and she was wise  subtle  and knew more than one way  to skin a cat  or a nation  she invented  divine right of kings    and propped it all around  brick by brick  with the beatitudes    wrenching them from their good purpose to make them fortify  an evil one  she preached  to the commoner  humility  obedience  to superiors  the beauty of self sacrifice  she preached  to the  commoner  meekness under insult  preached  still to the commoner   always to the commoner  patience  meanness of spirit  non resistance  under oppression  and she introduced heritable ranks and  aristocracies  and taught all the christian populations of the earth  to bow down to them and worship them   even down to my birth century  that poison was still in the blood of christendom  and the best  of english commoners was still content to see his inferiors  impudently continuing to hold a number of positions  such as  lordships and the throne  to which the grotesque laws of his country  did not allow him to aspire  in fact  he was not merely contented  with this strange condition of things  he was even able to persuade  himself that he was proud of it   it seems to show that there isn t  anything you can t stand  if you are only born and bred to it   of course that taint  that reverence for rank and title  had been  in our american blood  too  i know that  but when i left america  it had disappeared  at least to all intents and purposes   the  remnant of it was restricted to the dudes and dudesses   when  a disease has worked its way down to that level  it may fairly  be said to be out of the system     but to return to my anomalous position in king arthur s kingdom   here i was  a giant among pigmies  a man among children  a master  intelligence among intellectual moles  by all rational measurement  the one and only actually great man in that whole british world   and yet there and then  just as in the remote england of my  birth time  the sheep witted earl who could claim long descent  from a king s leman  acquired at second hand from the slums of  london  was a better man than i was   such a personage was fawned  upon in arthur s realm and reverently looked up to by everybody   even though his dispositions were as mean as his intelligence   and his morals as base as his lineage   there were times when   he  could sit down in the king s presence  but i couldn t   i could  have got a title easily enough  and that would have raised me  a large step in everybody s eyes  even in the king s  the giver  of it   but i didn t ask for it  and i declined it when it was  offered   i couldn t have enjoyed such a thing with my notions   and it wouldn t have been fair  anyway  because as far back as  i could go  our tribe had always been short of the bar sinister   i couldn t have felt really and satisfactorily fine and proud  and set up over any title except one that should come from the nation  itself  the only legitimate source  and such an one i hoped to win   and in the course of years of honest and honorable endeavor  i did  win it and did wear it with a high and clean pride   this title  fell casually from the lips of a blacksmith  one day  in a village   was caught up as a happy thought and tossed from mouth to mouth  with a laugh and an affirmative vote  in ten days it had swept  the kingdom  and was become as familiar as the king s name   i was  never known by any other designation afterward  whether in the  nation s talk or in grave debate upon matters of state at the  council board of the sovereign   this title  translated into modern  speech  would be the boss   elected by the nation   that suited me   and it was a pretty high title   there were very few the s  and  i was one of them   if you spoke of the duke  or the earl  or  the bishop  how could anybody tell which one you meant   but if  you spoke of the king or the queen or the boss  it was different     well  i liked the king  and as king i respected him  respected  the office  at least respected it as much as i was capable of  respecting any unearned supremacy  but as men i looked down upon  him and his nobles  privately   and he and they liked me  and  respected my office  but as an animal  without birth or sham title   they looked down upon me  and were not particularly private about it   either   i didn t charge for my opinion about them  and they didn t  charge for their opinion about me  the account was square  the  books balanced  everybody was satisfied         chapter ix    the tournament    they were always having grand tournaments there at camelot  and  very stirring and picturesque and ridiculous human bull fights  they were  too  but just a little wearisome to the practical mind   however  i was generally on hand  for two reasons  a man must  not hold himself aloof from the things which his friends and his  community have at heart if he would be liked  especially as  a statesman  and both as business man and statesman i wanted  to study the tournament and see if i couldn t invent an improvement  on it   that reminds me to remark  in passing  that the very first  official thing i did  in my administration  and it was on the very  first day of it  too  was to start a patent office  for i knew  that a country without a patent office and good patent laws was  just a crab  and couldn t travel any way but sideways or backways     things ran along  a tournament nearly every week  and now and then  the boys used to want me to take a hand  i mean sir launcelot and  the rest  but i said i would by and by  no hurry yet  and too much  government machinery to oil up and set to rights and start a going     we had one tournament which was continued from day to day during  more than a week  and as many as five hundred knights took part  in it  from first to last   they were weeks gathering   they came  on horseback from everywhere  from the very ends of the country   and even from beyond the sea  and many brought ladies  and all  brought squires and troops of servants   it was a most gaudy and  gorgeous crowd  as to costumery  and very characteristic of the  country and the time  in the way of high animal spirits  innocent  indecencies of language  and happy hearted indifference to morals   it was fight or look on  all day and every day  and sing  gamble   dance  carouse half the night every night   they had a most noble  good time   you never saw such people   those banks of beautiful  ladies  shining in their barbaric splendors  would see a knight  sprawl from his horse in the lists with a lanceshaft the thickness  of your ankle clean through him and the blood spouting  and instead  of fainting they would clap their hands and crowd each other for a  better view  only sometimes one would dive into her handkerchief   and look ostentatiously broken hearted  and then you could lay  two to one that there was a scandal there somewhere and she was  afraid the public hadn t found it out     the noise at night would have been annoying to me ordinarily  but  i didn t mind it in the present circumstances  because it kept me  from hearing the quacks detaching legs and arms from the day s  cripples   they ruined an uncommon good old cross cut saw for me   and broke the saw buck  too  but i let it pass   and as for my  axe  well  i made up my mind that the next time i lent an axe  to a surgeon i would pick my century     i not only watched this tournament from day to day  but detailed  an intelligent priest from my department of public morals and  agriculture  and ordered him to report it  for it was my purpose  by and by  when i should have gotten the people along far enough   to start a newspaper   the first thing you want in a new country   is a patent office  then work up your school system  and after that   out with your paper   a newspaper has its faults  and plenty of them   but no matter  it s hark from the tomb for a dead nation  and don t  you forget it   you can t resurrect a dead nation without it  there  isn t any way   so i wanted to sample things  and be finding out  what sort of reporter material i might be able to rake together out  of the sixth century when i should come to need it     well  the priest did very well  considering   he got in all  the details  and that is a good thing in a local item  you see   he had kept books for the undertaker department of his church  when he was younger  and there  you know  the money s in the details   the more details  the more swag  bearers  mutes  candles  prayers    everything counts  and if the bereaved don t buy prayers enough  you mark up your candles with a forked pencil  and your bill  shows up all right   and he had a good knack at getting in the  complimentary thing here and there about a knight that was likely  to advertise  no  i mean a knight that had influence  and he also  had a neat gift of exaggeration  for in his time he had kept door  for a pious hermit who lived in a sty and worked miracles     of course this novice s report lacked whoop and crash and lurid  description  and therefore wanted the true ring  but its antique  wording was quaint and sweet and simple  and full of the fragrances  and flavors of the time  and these little merits made up in a measure  for its more important lacks   here is an extract from it       then sir brian de les isles and grummore grummorsum     knights of the castle  encountered with sir aglovale and    sir tor  and sir tor smote down sir grummore grummorsum    to the earth   then came sir carados of the dolorous    tower  and sir turquine  knights of the castle  and    there encountered with them sir percivale de galis    and sir lamorak de galis  that were two brethren  and    there encountered sir percivale with sir carados  and    either brake their spears unto their hands  and then    sir turquine with sir lamorak  and either of them smote    down other  horse and all  to the earth  and either    parties rescued other and horsed them again   and sir    arnold  and sir gauter  knights of the castle     encountered with sir brandiles and sir kay  and these    four knights encountered mightily  and brake their    spears to their hands   then came sir pertolope from    the castle  and there encountered with him sir lionel     and there sir pertolope the green knight smote down sir    lionel  brother to sir launcelot   all this was marked    by noble heralds  who bare him best  and their names     then sir bleobaris brake his spear upon sir gareth     but of that stroke sir bleobaris fell to the earth     when sir galihodin saw that  he bad sir gareth keep him     and sir gareth smote him to the earth   then sir galihud    gat a spear to avenge his brother  and in the same wise    sir gareth served him  and sir dinadan and his brother    la cote male taile  and sir sagramore le disirous  and    sir dodinas le savage  all these he bare down with one    spear   when king aswisance of ireland saw sir gareth    fare so he marvelled what he might be  that one time    seemed green  and another time  at his again coming     he seemed blue   and thus at every course that he rode    to and fro he changed his color  so that there might    neither king nor knight have ready cognizance of him     then sir agwisance the king of ireland encountered    with sir gareth  and there sir gareth smote him from    his horse  saddle and all   and then came king carados    of scotland  and sir gareth smote him down horse and    man   and in the same wise he served king uriens of the    land of gore   and then there came in sir bagdemagus     and sir gareth smote him down horse and man to the    earth   and bagdemagus s son meliganus brake a spear    upon sir gareth mightily and knightly   and then sir    galahault the noble prince cried on high  knight with    the many colors  well hast thou justed  now make thee    ready that i may just with thee   sir gareth heard him     and he gat a great spear  and so they encountered    together  and there the prince brake his spear  but sir    gareth smote him upon the left side of the helm  that    he reeled here and there  and he had fallen down had not    his men recovered him   truly  said king arthur  that    knight with the many colors is a good knight   wherefore    the king called unto him sir launcelot  and prayed him    to encounter with that knight   sir  said launcelot  i    may as well find in my heart for to forbear him at    this time  for he hath had travail enough this day  and    when a good knight doth so well upon some day  it is    no good knight s part to let him of his worship  and     namely  when he seeth a knight hath done so great    labour  for peradventure  said sir launcelot  his    quarrel is here this day  and peradventure he is best    beloved with this lady of all that be here  for i see    well he paineth himself and enforceth him to do great    deeds  and therefore  said sir launcelot  as for me     this day he shall have the honour  though it lay in my    power to put him from it  i would not     there was an unpleasant little episode that day  which for reasons  of state i struck out of my priest s report   you will have noticed  that garry was doing some great fighting in the engagement   when  i say garry i mean sir gareth   garry was my private pet name  for him  it suggests that i had a deep affection for him  and that  was the case   but it was a private pet name only  and never spoken  aloud to any one  much less to him  being a noble  he would not  have endured a familiarity like that from me   well  to proceed   i sat in the private box set apart for me as the king s minister   while sir dinadan was waiting for his turn to enter the lists   he came in there and sat down and began to talk  for he was always  making up to me  because i was a stranger and he liked to have  a fresh market for his jokes  the most of them having reached that  stage of wear where the teller has to do the laughing himself while  the other person looks sick   i had always responded to his efforts  as well as i could  and felt a very deep and real kindness for him   too  for the reason that if by malice of fate he knew the one  particular anecdote which i had heard oftenest and had most hated  and most loathed all my life  he had at least spared it me   it was  one which i had heard attributed to every humorous person who  had ever stood on american soil  from columbus down to artemus ward   it was about a humorous lecturer who flooded an ignorant audience  with the killingest jokes for an hour and never got a laugh  and  then when he was leaving  some gray simpletons wrung him gratefully  by the hand and said it had been the funniest thing they had ever  heard  and  it was all they could do to keep from laughin  right  out in meetin     that anecdote never saw the day that it was  worth the telling  and yet i had sat under the telling of it  hundreds and thousands and millions and billions of times  and  cried and cursed all the way through   then who can hope to know  what my feelings were  to hear this armor plated ass start in on  it again  in the murky twilight of tradition  before the dawn of  history  while even lactantius might be referred to as  the late  lactantius   and the crusades wouldn t be born for five hundred  years yet   just as he finished  the call boy came  so  haw hawing  like a demon  he went rattling and clanking out like a crate of  loose castings  and i knew nothing more   it was some minutes  before i came to  and then i opened my eyes just in time to see  sir gareth fetch him an awful welt  and i unconsciously out with  the prayer   i hope to gracious he s killed    but by ill luck   before i had got half through with the words  sir gareth crashed  into sir sagramor le desirous and sent him thundering over his  horse s crupper  and sir sagramor caught my remark and thought  i meant it for  him      well  whenever one of those people got a thing into his head   there was no getting it out again   i knew that  so i saved my  breath  and offered no explanations   as soon as sir sagramor  got well  he notified me that there was a little account to settle  between us  and he named a day three or four years in the future   place of settlement  the lists where the offense had been given   i said i would be ready when he got back   you see  he was going  for the holy grail   the boys all took a flier at the holy grail  now and then   it was a several years  cruise   they always put in  the long absence snooping around  in the most conscientious way   though none of them had any idea where the holy grail really was   and i don t think any of them actually expected to find it  or  would have known what to do with it if he  had  run across it   you see  it was just the northwest passage of that day  as you may  say  that was all   every year expeditions went out holy grailing   and next year relief expeditions went out to hunt for  them    there  was worlds of reputation in it  but no money   why  they actually  wanted  me  to put in   well  i should smile         chapter x    beginnings of civilization    the round table soon heard of the challenge  and of course it was  a good deal discussed  for such things interested the boys   the king thought i ought now to set forth in quest of adventures   so that i might gain renown and be the more worthy to meet  sir sagramor when the several years should have rolled away   i excused myself for the present  i said it would take me three  or four years yet to get things well fixed up and going smoothly   then i should be ready  all the chances were that at the end of  that time sir sagramor would still be out grailing  so no valuable  time would be lost by the postponement  i should then have been  in office six or seven years  and i believed my system and machinery  would be so well developed that i could take a holiday without  its working any harm     i was pretty well satisfied with what i had already accomplished   in various quiet nooks and corners i had the beginnings of all  sorts of industries under way  nuclei of future vast factories   the iron and steel missionaries of my future civilization   in these  were gathered together the brightest young minds i could find   and i kept agents out raking the country for more  all the time   i was training a crowd of ignorant folk into experts  experts  in every sort of handiwork and scientific calling   these nurseries  of mine went smoothly and privately along undisturbed in their  obscure country retreats  for nobody was allowed to come into their  precincts without a special permit  for i was afraid of the church     i had started a teacher factory and a lot of sunday schools the  first thing  as a result  i now had an admirable system of graded  schools in full blast in those places  and also a complete variety  of protestant congregations all in a prosperous and growing  condition   everybody could be any kind of a christian he wanted  to  there was perfect freedom in that matter   but i confined public  religious teaching to the churches and the sunday schools  permitting  nothing of it in my other educational buildings   i could have  given my own sect the preference and made everybody a presbyterian  without any trouble  but that would have been to affront a law  of human nature  spiritual wants and instincts are as various in  the human family as are physical appetites  complexions  and  features  and a man is only at his best  morally  when he is  equipped with the religious garment whose color and shape and  size most nicely accommodate themselves to the spiritual complexion   angularities  and stature of the individual who wears it  and   besides  i was afraid of a united church  it makes a mighty power   the mightiest conceivable  and then when it by and by gets into  selfish hands  as it is always bound to do  it means death to  human liberty and paralysis to human thought     all mines were royal property  and there were a good many of them   they had formerly been worked as savages always work mines  holes  grubbed in the earth and the mineral brought up in sacks of hide by  hand  at the rate of a ton a day  but i had begun to put the mining  on a scientific basis as early as i could     yes  i had made pretty handsome progress when sir sagramor s  challenge struck me     four years rolled by  and then   well  you would never imagine  it in the world   unlimited power is the ideal thing when it is in  safe hands   the despotism of heaven is the one absolutely perfect  government   an earthly despotism would be the absolutely perfect  earthly government  if the conditions were the same  namely  the  despot the perfectest individual of the human race  and his lease  of life perpetual   but as a perishable perfect man must die  and  leave his despotism in the hands of an imperfect successor  an  earthly despotism is not merely a bad form of government  it is  the worst form that is possible     my works showed what a despot could do with the resources of  a kingdom at his command   unsuspected by this dark land  i had  the civilization of the nineteenth century booming under its very  nose   it was fenced away from the public view  but there it was   a gigantic and unassailable fact  and to be heard from  yet  if  i lived and had luck   there it was  as sure a fact and as substantial  a fact as any serene volcano  standing innocent with its smokeless  summit in the blue sky and giving no sign of the rising hell in its  bowels   my schools and churches were children four years before   they were grown up now  my shops of that day were vast factories  now  where i had a dozen trained men then  i had a thousand now   where i had one brilliant expert then  i had fifty now   i stood  with my hand on the cock  so to speak  ready to turn it on and  flood the midnight world with light at any moment   but i was not  going to do the thing in that sudden way   it was not my policy   the people could not have stood it  and  moreover  i should have  had the established roman catholic church on my back in a minute     no  i had been going cautiously all the while   i had had confidential  agents trickling through the country some time  whose office was  to undermine knighthood by imperceptible degrees  and to gnaw  a little at this and that and the other superstition  and so prepare  the way gradually for a better order of things   i was turning on  my light one candle power at a time  and meant to continue to do so     i had scattered some branch schools secretly about the kingdom   and they were doing very well   i meant to work this racket more  and more  as time wore on  if nothing occurred to frighten me   one of my deepest secrets was my west point  my military academy   i kept that most jealously out of sight  and i did the same with my  naval academy which i had established at a remote seaport   both  were prospering to my satisfaction     clarence was twenty two now  and was my head executive  my right  hand   he was a darling  he was equal to anything  there wasn t  anything he couldn t turn his hand to   of late i had been training  him for journalism  for the time seemed about right for a start  in the newspaper line  nothing big  but just a small weekly for  experimental circulation in my civilization nurseries   he took  to it like a duck  there was an editor concealed in him  sure   already he had doubled himself in one way  he talked sixth century  and wrote nineteenth   his journalistic style was climbing   steadily  it was already up to the back settlement alabama mark   and couldn t be told from the editorial output of that region  either by matter or flavor     we had another large departure on hand  too   this was a telegraph  and a telephone  our first venture in this line   these wires were  for private service only  as yet  and must be kept private until  a riper day should come   we had a gang of men on the road  working  mainly by night   they were stringing ground wires  we were afraid  to put up poles  for they would attract too much inquiry   ground  wires were good enough  in both instances  for my wires were  protected by an insulation of my own invention which was perfect   my men had orders to strike across country  avoiding roads  and  establishing connection with any considerable towns whose lights  betrayed their presence  and leaving experts in charge  nobody  could tell you how to find any place in the kingdom  for nobody  ever went intentionally to any place  but only struck it by  accident in his wanderings  and then generally left it without  thinking to inquire what its name was   at one time and another  we had sent out topographical expeditions to survey and map the  kingdom  but the priests had always interfered and raised trouble   so we had given the thing up  for the present  it would be poor  wisdom to antagonize the church     as for the general condition of the country  it was as it had been  when i arrived in it  to all intents and purposes   i had made  changes  but they were necessarily slight  and they were not  noticeable   thus far  i had not even meddled with taxation   outside of the taxes which provided the royal revenues   i had  systematized those  and put the service on an effective and  righteous basis   as a result  these revenues were already quadrupled   and yet the burden was so much more equably distributed than  before  that all the kingdom felt a sense of relief  and the praises  of my administration were hearty and general     personally  i struck an interruption  now  but i did not mind it   it could not have happened at a better time   earlier it could  have annoyed me  but now everything was in good hands and swimming  right along   the king had reminded me several times  of late  that  the postponement i had asked for  four years before  had about  run out now   it was a hint that i ought to be starting out to seek  adventures and get up a reputation of a size to make me worthy  of the honor of breaking a lance with sir sagramor  who was still  out grailing  but was being hunted for by various relief expeditions   and might be found any year  now   so you see i was expecting  this interruption  it did not take me by surprise         chapter xi    the yankee in search of adventures    there never was such a country for wandering liars  and they were  of both sexes   hardly a month went by without one of these tramps  arriving  and generally loaded with a tale about some princess or  other wanting help to get her out of some far away castle where  she was held in captivity by a lawless scoundrel  usually a giant   now you would think that the first thing the king would do after  listening to such a novelette from an entire stranger  would be  to ask for credentials  yes  and a pointer or two as to locality  of castle  best route to it  and so on   but nobody ever thought  of so simple and common sense a thing at that   no  everybody  swallowed these people s lies whole  and never asked a question  of any sort or about anything   well  one day when i was not  around  one of these people came along  it was a she one  this  time  and told a tale of the usual pattern   her mistress was  a captive in a vast and gloomy castle  along with forty four other  young and beautiful girls  pretty much all of them princesses   they had been languishing in that cruel captivity for twenty six  years  the masters of the castle were three stupendous brothers   each with four arms and one eye  the eye in the center of the  forehead  and as big as a fruit   sort of fruit not mentioned   their usual slovenliness in statistics     would you believe it   the king and the whole round table were  in raptures over this preposterous opportunity for adventure   every knight of the table jumped for the chance  and begged for it   but to their vexation and chagrin the king conferred it upon me   who had not asked for it at all     by an effort  i contained my joy when clarence brought me the news   but he  he could not contain his   his mouth gushed delight and  gratitude in a steady discharge  delight in my good fortune   gratitude to the king for this splendid mark of his favor for me   he could keep neither his legs nor his body still  but pirouetted  about the place in an airy ecstasy of happiness     on my side  i could have cursed the kindness that conferred upon  me this benefaction  but i kept my vexation under the surface  for policy s sake  and did what i could to let on to be glad   indeed  i  said  i was glad   and in a way it was true  i was as  glad as a person is when he is scalped     well  one must make the best of things  and not waste time with  useless fretting  but get down to business and see what can be  done   in all lies there is wheat among the chaff  i must get at  the wheat in this case  so i sent for the girl and she came   she  was a comely enough creature  and soft and modest  but  if signs  went for anything  she didn t know as much as a lady s watch   i said      my dear  have you been questioned as to particulars      she said she hadn t      well  i didn t expect you had  but i thought i would ask  to make  sure  it s the way i ve been raised   now you mustn t take it  unkindly if i remind you that as we don t know you  we must go  a little slow   you may be all right  of course  and we ll hope  that you are  but to take it for granted isn t business    you   understand that   i m obliged to ask you a few questions  just  answer up fair and square  and don t be afraid   where do you  live  when you are at home       in the land of moder  fair sir       land of moder   i don t remember hearing of it before   parents living       as to that  i know not if they be yet on live  sith it is many  years that i have lain shut up in the castle       your name  please       i hight the demoiselle alisande la carteloise  an it please you       do you know anybody here who can identify you       that were not likely  fair lord  i being come hither now for  the first time       have you brought any letters  any documents  any proofs that  you are trustworthy and truthful       of a surety  no  and wherefore should i   have i not a tongue   and cannot i say all that myself       but  your  saying it  you know  and somebody else s saying it   is different       different   how might that be   i fear me i do not understand       don t  understand    land of  why  you see  you see  why  great scott   can t you understand a little thing like that   can t you understand  the difference between your   why  do you look so innocent and idiotic       i   in truth i know not  but an it were the will of god       yes  yes  i reckon that s about the size of it   don t mind my  seeming excited  i m not   let us change the subject   now as  to this castle  with forty five princesses in it  and three ogres  at the head of it  tell me  where is this harem       harem       the  castle   you understand  where is the castle       oh  as to that  it is great  and strong  and well beseen  and  lieth in a far country   yes  it is many leagues        how  many       ah  fair sir  it were woundily hard to tell  they are so many   and do so lap the one upon the other  and being made all in the  same image and tincted with the same color  one may not know  the one league from its fellow  nor how to count them except  they be taken apart  and ye wit well it were god s work to do  that  being not within man s capacity  for ye will note        hold on  hold on  never mind about the distance   whereabouts   does the castle lie   what s the direction from here       ah  please you sir  it hath no direction from here  by reason  that the road lieth not straight  but turneth evermore  wherefore  the direction of its place abideth not  but is some time under  the one sky and anon under another  whereso if ye be minded that  it is in the east  and wend thitherward  ye shall observe that  the way of the road doth yet again turn upon itself by the space  of half a circle  and this marvel happing again and yet again and  still again  it will grieve you that you had thought by vanities  of the mind to thwart and bring to naught the will of him that  giveth not a castle a direction from a place except it pleaseth  him  and if it please him not  will the rather that even all castles  and all directions thereunto vanish out of the earth  leaving the  places wherein they tarried desolate and vacant  so warning his  creatures that where he will he will  and where he will not he        oh  that s all right  that s all right  give us a rest  never mind  about the direction   hang  the direction  i beg pardon  i beg  a thousand pardons  i am not well to day  pay no attention when  i soliloquize  it is an old habit  an old  bad habit  and hard  to get rid of when one s digestion is all disordered with eating  food that was raised forever and ever before he was born  good  land  a man can t keep his functions regular on spring chickens  thirteen hundred years old   but come  never mind about that   let s  have you got such a thing as a map of that region about  you   now a good map        is it peradventure that manner of thing which of late the unbelievers  have brought from over the great seas  which  being boiled in oil   and an onion and salt added thereto  doth        what  a map   what are you talking about   don t you know what  a map is   there  there  never mind  don t explain  i hate  explanations  they fog a thing up so that you can t tell anything  about it   run along  dear  good day  show her the way  clarence      oh  well  it was reasonably plain  now  why these donkeys didn t  prospect these liars for details   it may be that this girl had  a fact in her somewhere  but i don t believe you could have sluiced  it out with a hydraulic  nor got it with the earlier forms of  blasting  even  it was a case for dynamite   why  she was a perfect  ass  and yet the king and his knights had listened to her as if  she had been a leaf out of the gospel   it kind of sizes up the  whole party   and think of the simple ways of this court  this  wandering wench hadn t any more trouble to get access to the king  in his palace than she would have had to get into the poorhouse  in my day and country   in fact  he was glad to see her  glad  to hear her tale  with that adventure of hers to offer  she was  as welcome as a corpse is to a coroner     just as i was ending up these reflections  clarence came back   i remarked upon the barren result of my efforts with the girl   hadn t got hold of a single point that could help me to find  the castle   the youth looked a little surprised  or puzzled   or something  and intimated that he had been wondering to himself  what i had wanted to ask the girl all those questions for      why  great guns   i said   don t i want to find the castle   and  how else would i go about it       la  sweet your worship  one may lightly answer that  i ween   she will go with thee   they always do   she will ride with thee       ride with me   nonsense       but of a truth she will   she will ride with thee   thou shalt see       what   she browse around the hills and scour the woods with me    alone  and i as good as engaged to be married   why  it s scandalous   think how it would look      my  the dear face that rose before me   the boy was eager to know  all about this tender matter   i swore him to secrecy and then  whispered her name   puss flanagan    he looked disappointed   and said he didn t remember the countess   how natural it was for  the little courtier to give her a rank   he asked me where she lived      in east har    i came to myself and stopped  a little confused   then i said   never mind  now  i ll tell you some time      and might he see her   would i let him see her some day     it was but a little thing to promise  thirteen hundred years  or so  and he so eager  so i said yes   but i sighed  i couldn t  help it   and yet there was no sense in sighing  for she wasn t  born yet   but that is the way we are made  we don t reason   where we feel  we just feel     my expedition was all the talk that day and that night  and the  boys were very good to me  and made much of me  and seemed to have  forgotten their vexation and disappointment  and come to be as  anxious for me to hive those ogres and set those ripe old virgins  loose as if it were themselves that had the contract   well  they   were  good children  but just children  that is all   and they  gave me no end of points about how to scout for giants  and how  to scoop them in  and they told me all sorts of charms against  enchantments  and gave me salves and other rubbish to put on my  wounds   but it never occurred to one of them to reflect that if  i was such a wonderful necromancer as i was pretending to be   i ought not to need salves or instructions  or charms against  enchantments  and  least of all  arms and armor  on a foray of any  kind  even against fire spouting dragons  and devils hot from  perdition  let alone such poor adversaries as these i was after   these commonplace ogres of the back settlements     i was to have an early breakfast  and start at dawn  for that was  the usual way  but i had the demon s own time with my armor   and this delayed me a little   it is troublesome to get into  and  there is so much detail   first you wrap a layer or two of blanket  around your body  for a sort of cushion and to keep off the cold  iron  then you put on your sleeves and shirt of chain mail  these  are made of small steel links woven together  and they form a fabric  so flexible that if you toss your shirt onto the floor  it slumps  into a pile like a peck of wet fish net  it is very heavy and  is nearly the uncomfortablest material in the world for a night  shirt  yet plenty used it for that  tax collectors  and reformers   and one horse kings with a defective title  and those sorts of  people  then you put on your shoes  flat boats roofed over with  interleaving bands of steel  and screw your clumsy spurs into  the heels   next you buckle your greaves on your legs  and your  cuisses on your thighs  then come your backplate and your breastplate   and you begin to feel crowded  then you hitch onto the breastplate  the half petticoat of broad overlapping bands of steel which hangs  down in front but is scolloped out behind so you can sit down   and isn t any real improvement on an inverted coal scuttle  either  for looks or for wear  or to wipe your hands on  next you belt  on your sword  then you put your stove pipe joints onto your arms   your iron gauntlets onto your hands  your iron rat trap onto your  head  with a rag of steel web hitched onto it to hang over the back  of your neck  and there you are  snug as a candle in a candle mould   this is no time to dance   well  a man that is packed away like  that is a nut that isn t worth the cracking  there is so little of  the meat  when you get down to it  by comparison with the shell     the boys helped me  or i never could have got in   just as we  finished  sir bedivere happened in  and i saw that as like as not  i hadn t chosen the most convenient outfit for a long trip   how  stately he looked  and tall and broad and grand   he had on his  head a conical steel casque that only came down to his ears  and  for visor had only a narrow steel bar that extended down to his  upper lip and protected his nose  and all the rest of him  from  neck to heel  was flexible chain mail  trousers and all   but  pretty much all of him was hidden under his outside garment  which  of course was of chain mail  as i said  and hung straight from his  shoulders to his ankles  and from his middle to the bottom  both  before and behind  was divided  so that he could ride and let the  skirts hang down on each side   he was going grailing  and it was  just the outfit for it  too   i would have given a good deal for  that ulster  but it was too late now to be fooling around   the sun  was just up  the king and the court were all on hand to see me off  and wish me luck  so it wouldn t be etiquette for me to tarry   you don t get on your horse yourself  no  if you tried it you  would get disappointed   they carry you out  just as they carry  a sun struck man to the drug store  and put you on  and help get  you to rights  and fix your feet in the stirrups  and all the while  you do feel so strange and stuffy and like somebody else  like  somebody that has been married on a sudden  or struck by lightning   or something like that  and hasn t quite fetched around yet  and  is sort of numb  and can t just get his bearings   then they  stood up the mast they called a spear  in its socket by my left  foot  and i gripped it with my hand  lastly they hung my shield  around my neck  and i was all complete and ready to up anchor  and get to sea   everybody was as good to me as they could be   and a maid of honor gave me the stirrup cup her own self   there was  nothing more to do now  but for that damsel to get up behind me on  a pillion  which she did  and put an arm or so around me to hold on     and so we started  and everybody gave us a goodbye and waved their  handkerchiefs or helmets   and everybody we met  going down the hill  and through the village was respectful to us  except some shabby  little boys on the outskirts   they said      oh  what a guy    and hove clods at us     in my experience boys are the same in all ages   they don t respect  anything  they don t care for anything or anybody   they say   go up  baldhead  to the prophet going his unoffending way in  the gray of antiquity  they sass me in the holy gloom of the  middle ages  and i had seen them act the same way in buchanan s  administration  i remember  because i was there and helped   the  prophet had his bears and settled with his boys  and i wanted  to get down and settle with mine  but it wouldn t answer  because  i couldn t have got up again   i hate a country without a derrick             bear to allow  anybody to help in this service  so we two stood watch and watch   day in and day out   ah  sandy  what a right heart she had  how  simple  and genuine  and good she was   she was a flawless wife  and mother  and yet i had married her for no other particular  reasons  except that by the customs of chivalry she was my property  until some knight should win her from me in the field   she had  hunted britain over for me  had found me at the hanging bout  outside of london  and had straightway resumed her old place at  my side in the placidest way and as of right   i was a new englander   and in my opinion this sort of partnership would compromise her   sooner or later   she couldn t see how  but i cut argument short  and we had a wedding     now i didn t know i was drawing a prize  yet that was what i did  draw   within the twelvemonth i became her worshiper  and ours  was the dearest and perfectest comradeship that ever was   people  talk about beautiful friendships between two persons of the same  sex   what is the best of that sort  as compared with the friendship  of man and wife  where the best impulses and highest ideals of  both are the same   there is no place for comparison between  the two friendships  the one is earthly  the other divine     in my dreams  along at first  i still wandered thirteen centuries  away  and my unsatisfied spirit went calling and harking all up  and down the unreplying vacancies of a vanished world   many a  time sandy heard that imploring cry come from my lips in my sleep   with a grand magnanimity she saddled that cry of mine upon our  child  conceiving it to be the name of some lost darling of mine   it touched me to tears  and it also nearly knocked me off my feet   too  when she smiled up in my face for an earned reward  and played  her quaint and pretty surprise upon me      the name of one who was dear to thee is here preserved  here made  holy  and the music of it will abide alway in our ears   now  thou lt kiss me  as knowing the name i have given the child      but i didn t know it  all the same   i hadn t an idea in the  world  but it would have been cruel to confess it and spoil her  pretty game  so i never let on  but said      yes  i know  sweetheart  how dear and good it is of you  too   but i want to hear these lips of yours  which are also mine  utter  it first  then its music will be perfect      pleased to the marrow  she murmured      hello central      i didn t laugh  i am always thankful for that  but the strain  ruptured every cartilage in me  and for weeks afterward i could  hear my bones clack when i walked   she never found out her mistake   the first time she heard that form of salute used at the telephone  she was surprised  and not pleased  but i told her i had given  order for it  that henceforth and forever the telephone must  always be invoked with that reverent formality  in perpetual honor  and remembrance of my lost friend and her small namesake   this  was not true   but it answered     well  during two weeks and a half we watched by the crib  and in  our deep solicitude we were unconscious of any world outside of  that sick room   then our reward came  the center of the universe  turned the corner and began to mend   grateful   it isn t the term   there  isn t  any term for it   you know that yourself  if you ve  watched your child through the valley of the shadow and seen it  come back to life and sweep night out of the earth with one  all illuminating smile that you could cover with your hand     why  we were back in this world in one instant   then we looked  the same startled thought into each other s eyes at the same  moment  more than two weeks gone  and that ship not back yet     in another minute i appeared in the presence of my train   they  had been steeped in troubled bodings all this time  their faces  showed it   i called an escort and we galloped five miles to a  hilltop overlooking the sea   where was my great commerce that  so lately had made these glistening expanses populous and beautiful  with its white winged flocks   vanished  every one   not a sail   from verge to verge  not a smoke bank  just a dead and empty  solitude  in place of all that brisk and breezy life     i went swiftly back  saying not a word to anybody   i told sandy  this ghastly news   we could imagine no explanation that would  begin to explain   had there been an invasion  an earthquake   a pestilence   had the nation been swept out of existence   but  guessing was profitless   i must go  at once   i borrowed the king s  navy  a  ship  no bigger than a steam launch  and was soon ready     the parting  ah  yes  that was hard   as i was devouring the child  with last kisses  it brisked up and jabbered out its vocabulary     the first time in more than two weeks  and it made fools of us  for joy   the darling mispronunciations of childhood   dear me   there s no music that can touch it  and how one grieves when it  wastes away and dissolves into correctness  knowing it will never  visit his bereaved ear again   well  how good it was to be able  to carry that gracious memory away with me     i approached england the next morning  with the wide highway of  salt water all to myself   there were ships in the harbor  at  dover  but they were naked as to sails  and there was no sign  of life about them   it was sunday  yet at canterbury the streets  were empty  strangest of all  there was not even a priest in sight   and no stroke of a bell fell upon my ear   the mournfulness of  death was everywhere   i couldn t understand it   at last  in  the further edge of that town i saw a small funeral procession    just a family and a few friends following a coffin  no priest   a funeral without bell  book  or candle  there was a church there  close at hand  but they passed it by weeping  and did not enter it   i glanced up at the belfry  and there hung the bell  shrouded in  black  and its tongue tied back   now i knew   now i understood  the stupendous calamity that had overtaken england   invasion   invasion is a triviality to it   it was the interdict     i asked no questions  i didn t need to ask any   the church had  struck  the thing for me to do was to get into a disguise  and  go warily   one of my servants gave me a suit of clothes  and  when we were safe beyond the town i put them on  and from that time  i traveled alone  i could not risk the embarrassment of company     a miserable journey   a desolate silence everywhere   even in  london itself   traffic had ceased  men did not talk or laugh  or  go in groups  or even in couples  they moved aimlessly about  each  man by himself  with his head down  and woe and terror at his heart   the tower showed recent war scars   verily  much had been happening     of course  i meant to take the train for camelot   train   why   the station was as vacant as a cavern   i moved on   the journey  to camelot was a repetition of what i had already seen   the monday  and the tuesday differed in no way from the sunday   i arrived  far in the night   from being the best electric lighted town in  the kingdom and the most like a recumbent sun of anything you ever  saw  it was become simply a blot  a blot upon darkness  that is  to say  it was darker and solider than the rest of the darkness   and so you could see it a little better  it made me feel as if  maybe it was symbolical  a sort of sign that the church was going to   keep  the upper hand now  and snuff out all my beautiful civilization  just like that   i found no life stirring in the somber streets   i groped my way with a heavy heart   the vast castle loomed black  upon the hilltop  not a spark visible about it   the drawbridge  was down  the great gate stood wide  i entered without challenge   my own heels making the only sound i heard  and it was sepulchral  enough  in those huge vacant courts         chapter xlii    war     i found clarence alone in his quarters  drowned in melancholy   and in place of the electric light  he had reinstituted the ancient  rag lamp  and sat there in a grisly twilight with all curtains  drawn tight   he sprang up and rushed for me eagerly  saying      oh  it s worth a billion milrays to look upon a live person again      he knew me as easily as if i hadn t been disguised at all   which  frightened me  one may easily believe that      quick  now  tell me the meaning of this fearful disaster   i said    how did it come about       well  if there hadn t been any queen guenever  it wouldn t have  come so early  but it would have come  anyway   it would have  come on your own account by and by  by luck  it happened to come  on the queen s        and  sir launcelot s       just so       give me the details       i reckon you will grant that during some years there has been  only one pair of eyes in these kingdoms that has not been looking  steadily askance at the queen and sir launcelot        yes  king arthur s         and only one heart that was without suspicion        yes  the king s  a heart that isn t capable of thinking evil  of a friend       well  the king might have gone on  still happy and unsuspecting   to the end of his days  but for one of your modern improvements    the stock board   when you left  three miles of the london   canterbury and dover were ready for the rails  and also ready and  ripe for manipulation in the stock market   it was wildcat  and  everybody knew it   the stock was for sale at a give away   what  does sir launcelot do  but        yes  i know  he quietly picked up nearly all of it for a song   then he bought about twice as much more  deliverable upon call   and he was about to call when i left       very well  he did call   the boys couldn t deliver   oh  he had  them  and he just settled his grip and squeezed them   they were  laughing in their sleeves over their smartness in selling stock  to him at    and    and along there that wasn t worth      well   when they had laughed long enough on that side of their mouths   they rested up that side by shifting the laugh to the other side   that was when they compromised with the invincible at           good land       he skinned them alive  and they deserved it  anyway  the whole  kingdom rejoiced   well  among the flayed were sir agravaine and  sir mordred  nephews to the king   end of the first act   act  second  scene first  an apartment in carlisle castle  where the  court had gone for a few days  hunting   persons present  the  whole tribe of the king s nephews   mordred and agravaine propose  to call the guileless arthur s attention to guenever and sir  launcelot   sir gawaine  sir gareth  and sir gaheris will have  nothing to do with it   a dispute ensues  with loud talk  in the  midst of it enter the king   mordred and agravaine spring their  devastating tale upon him    tableau    a trap is laid for launcelot   by the king s command  and sir launcelot walks into it   he made  it sufficiently uncomfortable for the ambushed witnesses  to wit   mordred  agravaine  and twelve knights of lesser rank  for he  killed every one of them but mordred  but of course that couldn t  straighten matters between launcelot and the king  and didn t       oh  dear  only one thing could result  i see that   war  and  the knights of the realm divided into a king s party and a  sir launcelot s party       yes  that was the way of it   the king sent the queen to the  stake  proposing to purify her with fire   launcelot and his  knights rescued her  and in doing it slew certain good old friends  of yours and mine  in fact  some of the best we ever had  to wit   sir belias le orgulous  sir segwarides  sir griflet le fils de dieu   sir brandiles  sir aglovale        oh  you tear out my heartstrings         wait  i m not done yet  sir tor  sir gauter  sir gillimer        the very best man in my subordinate nine   what a handy right fielder  he was         sir reynold s three brothers  sir damus  sir priamus  sir kay  the stranger        my peerless short stop   i ve seen him catch a daisy cutter in  his teeth   come  i can t stand this         sir driant  sir lambegus  sir herminde  sir pertilope   sir perimones  and  whom do you think       rush   go on       sir gaheris  and sir gareth  both       oh  incredible   their love for launcelot was indestructible       well  it was an accident   they were simply onlookers  they were  unarmed  and were merely there to witness the queen s punishment   sir launcelot smote down whoever came in the way of his blind fury   and he killed these without noticing who they were   here is an  instantaneous photograph one of our boys got of the battle  it s  for sale on every news stand   there  the figures nearest the queen  are sir launcelot with his sword up  and sir gareth gasping his  latest breath   you can catch the agony in the queen s face through  the curling smoke   it s a rattling battle picture       indeed  it is   we must take good care of it  its historical value  is incalculable   go on       well  the rest of the tale is just war  pure and simple   launcelot  retreated to his town and castle of joyous gard  and gathered  there a great following of knights   the king  with a great host   went there  and there was desperate fighting during several days   and  as a result  all the plain around was paved with corpses  and cast iron   then the church patched up a peace between arthur  and launcelot and the queen and everybody  everybody but sir gawaine   he was bitter about the slaying of his brothers  gareth and gaheris   and would not be appeased   he notified launcelot to get him  thence  and make swift preparation  and look to be soon attacked   so launcelot sailed to his duchy of guienne with his following  and  gawaine soon followed with an army  and he beguiled arthur to go  with him   arthur left the kingdom in sir mordred s hands until  you should return        ah  a king s customary wisdom       yes   sir mordred set himself at once to work to make his kingship  permanent   he was going to marry guenever  as a first move  but  she fled and shut herself up in the tower of london   mordred  attacked  the bishop of canterbury dropped down on him with the  interdict   the king returned  mordred fought him at dover  at  canterbury  and again at barham down   then there was talk of peace  and a composition   terms  mordred to have cornwall and kent during  arthur s life  and the whole kingdom afterward       well  upon my word   my dream of a republic to  be  a dream  and  so remain       yes   the two armies lay near salisbury   gawaine  gawaine s head  is at dover castle  he fell in the fight there  gawaine appeared to  arthur in a dream  at least his ghost did  and warned him to  refrain from conflict for a month  let the delay cost what it might   but battle was precipitated by an accident   arthur had given  order that if a sword was raised during the consultation over  the proposed treaty with mordred  sound the trumpet and fall on   for he had no confidence in mordred   mordred had given a similar  order to  his  people   well  by and by an adder bit a knight s heel   the knight forgot all about the order  and made a slash at the  adder with his sword   inside of half a minute those two prodigious  hosts came together with a crash   they butchered away all day   then the king  however  we have started something fresh since  you left  our paper has       no   what is that       war correspondence       why  that s good       yes  the paper was booming right along  for the interdict made  no impression  got no grip  while the war lasted   i had war  correspondents with both armies   i will finish that battle by  reading you what one of the boys says         then the king looked about him  and then was he     ware of all his host and of all his good knights     were left no more on live but two knights  that     was sir lucan de butlere  and his brother sir     bedivere  and they were full sore wounded   jesu     mercy  said the king  where are all my noble     knights becomen   alas that ever i should see this     doleful day   for now  said arthur  i am come to     mine end   but would to god that i wist where were     that traitor sir mordred  that hath caused all     this mischief   then was king arthur ware where sir     mordred leaned upon his sword among a great heap     of dead men   now give me my spear  said arthur     unto sir lucan  for yonder i have espied the     traitor that all this woe hath wrought   sir  let     him be  said sir lucan  for he is unhappy  and if     ye pass this unhappy day  ye shall be right well     revenged upon him   good lord  remember ye of your     night s dream  and what the spirit of sir gawaine     told you this night  yet god of his great goodness     hath preserved you hitherto   therefore  for god s     sake  my lord  leave off by this  for blessed be     god ye have won the field  for here we be three     on live  and with sir mordred is none on live      and if ye leave off now  this wicked day of     destiny is past   tide me death  betide me life      saith the king  now i see him yonder alone  he     shall never escape mine hands  for at a better     avail shall i never have him   god speed you well      said sir bedivere   then the king gat his spear     in both his hands  and ran toward sir mordred     crying  traitor  now is thy death day come   and     when sir mordred heard sir arthur  he ran until     him with his sword drawn in his hand   and then     king arthur smote sir mordred under the shield      with a foin of his spear throughout the body more     than a fathom   and when sir mordred felt that he     had his death s wound  he thrust himself  with     the might that he had  up to the butt of king     arthur s spear   and right so he smote his father     arthur with his sword holden in both his hands      on the side of the head  that the sword pierced     the helmet and the brain pan  and therewithal     sir mordred fell stark dead to the earth   and     the noble arthur fell in a swoon to the earth      and there he swooned oft times         that is a good piece of war correspondence  clarence  you are  a first rate newspaper man   well  is the king all right   did  he get well       poor soul  no   he is dead      i was utterly stunned  it had not seemed to me that any wound  could be mortal to him      and the queen  clarence       she is a nun  in almesbury       what changes  and in such a short while   it is inconceivable   what next  i wonder       i can tell you what next       well       stake our lives and stand by them       what do you mean by that       the church is master now   the interdict included you with mordred   it is not to be removed while you remain alive   the clans are  gathering   the church has gathered all the knights that are left  alive  and as soon as you are discovered we shall have business  on our hands       stuff   with our deadly scientific war material  with our hosts  of trained        save your breath  we haven t sixty faithful left       what are you saying   our schools  our colleges  our vast  workshops  our        when those knights come  those establishments will empty themselves  and go over to the enemy   did you think you had educated the  superstition out of those people       i certainly did think it       well  then  you may unthink it   they stood every strain easily    until the interdict   since then  they merely put on a bold  outside  at heart they are quaking   make up your mind to it    when the armies come  the mask will fall       it s hard news   we are lost   they will turn our own science  against us       no they won t       why       because i and a handful of the faithful have blocked that game   i ll tell you what i ve done  and what moved me to it   smart as  you are  the church was smarter   it was the church that sent  you cruising  through her servants  the doctors       clarence       it is the truth   i know it   every officer of your ship was  the church s picked servant  and so was every man of the crew       oh  come       it is just as i tell you   i did not find out these things at once   but i found them out finally   did you send me verbal information   by the commander of the ship  to the effect that upon his return  to you  with supplies  you were going to leave cadiz        cadiz   i haven t been at cadiz at all         going to leave cadiz and cruise in distant seas indefinitely   for the health of your family   did you send me that word       of course not   i would have written  wouldn t i       naturally   i was troubled and suspicious   when the commander  sailed again i managed to ship a spy with him   i have never  heard of vessel or spy since   i gave myself two weeks to hear  from you in   then i resolved to send a ship to cadiz   there was  a reason why i didn t       what was that       our navy had suddenly and mysteriously disappeared   also  as  suddenly and as mysteriously  the railway and telegraph and  telephone service ceased  the men all deserted  poles were cut  down  the church laid a ban upon the electric light   i had to be  up and doing  and straight off   your life was safe  nobody in  these kingdoms but merlin would venture to touch such a magician  as you without ten thousand men at his back  i had nothing to  think of but how to put preparations in the best trim against your  coming   i felt safe myself  nobody would be anxious to touch  a pet of yours   so this is what i did   from our various works  i selected all the men  boys i mean  whose faithfulness under  whatsoever pressure i could swear to  and i called them together  secretly and gave them their instructions   there are fifty two of  them  none younger than fourteen  and none above seventeen years old       why did you select boys       because all the others were born in an atmosphere of superstition  and reared in it   it is in their blood and bones   we imagined  we had educated it out of them  they thought so  too  the interdict  woke them up like a thunderclap   it revealed them to themselves   and it revealed them to me  too   with boys it was different   such  as have been under our training from seven to ten years have had  no acquaintance with the church s terrors  and it was among these  that i found my fifty two   as a next move  i paid a private visit  to that old cave of merlin s  not the small one  the big one        yes  the one where we secretly established our first great electric  plant when i was projecting a miracle       just so   and as that miracle hadn t become necessary then   i thought it might be a good idea to utilize the plant now   i ve  provisioned the cave for a siege        a good idea  a first rate idea       i think so   i placed four of my boys there as a guard  inside   and out of sight   nobody was to be hurt  while outside  but any  attempt to enter  well  we said just let anybody try it   then  i went out into the hills and uncovered and cut the secret wires  which connected your bedroom with the wires that go to the dynamite  deposits under all our vast factories  mills  workshops  magazines   etc   and about midnight i and my boys turned out and connected  that wire with the cave  and nobody but you and i suspects where  the other end of it goes to   we laid it under ground  of course  and  it was all finished in a couple of hours or so   we sha n t have  to leave our fortress now when we want to blow up our civilization       it was the right move  and the natural one  military necessity   in the changed condition of things   well  what changes  have  come   we expected to be besieged in the palace some time or other  but    however  go on       next  we built a wire fence       wire fence       yes   you dropped the hint of it yourself  two or three years ago       oh  i remember  the time the church tried her strength against  us the first time  and presently thought it wise to wait for a  hopefuler season   well  how have you arranged the fence       i start twelve immensely strong wires  naked  not insulated    from a big dynamo in the cave  dynamo with no brushes except  a positive and a negative one        yes  that s right       the wires go out from the cave and fence in a circle of level  ground a hundred yards in diameter  they make twelve independent  fences  ten feet apart  that is to say  twelve circles within  circles  and their ends come into the cave again       right  go on       the fences are fastened to heavy oaken posts only three feet apart   and these posts are sunk five feet in the ground       that is good and strong       yes   the wires have no ground connection outside of the cave   they go out from the positive brush of the dynamo  there is a  ground connection through the negative brush  the other ends of  the wire return to the cave  and each is grounded independently       no  no  that won t do       why       it s too expensive  uses up force for nothing   you don t want  any ground connection except the one through the negative brush   the other end of every wire must be brought back into the cave  and fastened independently  and  without  any ground connection   now  then  observe the economy of it   a cavalry charge hurls  itself against the fence  you are using no power  you are spending  no money  for there is only one ground connection till those horses  come against the wire  the moment they touch it they form a  connection with the negative brush  through the ground   and drop  dead   don t you see   you are using no energy until it is needed   your lightning is there  and ready  like the load in a gun  but  it isn t costing you a cent till you touch it off   oh  yes  the  single ground connection        of course   i don t know how i overlooked that   it s not only  cheaper  but it s more effectual than the other way  for if wires  break or get tangled  no harm is done       no  especially if we have a tell tale in the cave and disconnect  the broken wire   well  go on   the gatlings       yes  that s arranged   in the center of the inner circle  on a  spacious platform six feet high  i ve grouped a battery of thirteen  gatling guns  and provided plenty of ammunition       that s it   they command every approach  and when the church s  knights arrive  there s going to be music   the brow of the  precipice over the cave        i ve got a wire fence there  and a gatling   they won t drop any  rocks down on us       well  and the glass cylinder dynamite torpedoes       that s attended to   it s the prettiest garden that was ever  planted   it s a belt forty feet wide  and goes around the outer  fence  distance between it and the fence one hundred yards  kind of  neutral ground that space is   there isn t a single square yard  of that whole belt but is equipped with a torpedo   we laid them  on the surface of the ground  and sprinkled a layer of sand over  them   it s an innocent looking garden  but you let a man start  in to hoe it once  and you ll see       you tested the torpedoes       well  i was going to  but        but what   why  it s an immense oversight not to apply a        test   yes  i know  but they re all right  i laid a few in the  public road beyond our lines and they ve been tested       oh  that alters the case   who did it       a church committee       how kind       yes   they came to command us to make submission   you see they  didn t really come to test the torpedoes  that was merely an incident       did the committee make a report       yes  they made one   you could have heard it a mile       unanimous       that was the nature of it   after that i put up some signs  for the  protection of future committees  and we have had no intruders since       clarence  you ve done a world of work  and done it perfectly       we had plenty of time for it  there wasn t any occasion for hurry      we sat silent awhile  thinking   then my mind was made up  and  i said      yes  everything is ready  everything is shipshape  no detail is  wanting   i know what to do now       so do i  sit down and wait       no   sir   rise up and  strike        do you mean it       yes  indeed   the  de fensive isn t in my line  and the  of fensive  is   that is  when i hold a fair hand  two thirds as good a hand  as the enemy   oh  yes  we ll rise up and strike  that s our game       a hundred to one you are right   when does the performance begin        now    we ll proclaim the republic       well  that  will  precipitate things  sure enough       it will make them buzz  i tell you   england will be a hornets   nest before noon to morrow  if the church s hand hasn t lost its  cunning  and we know it hasn t   now you write and i ll dictate thus                            proclamation                                          be it known unto all   whereas the king having died     and left no heir  it becomes my duty to continue the     executive authority vested in me  until a government     shall have been created and set in motion   the     monarchy has lapsed  it no longer exists   by     consequence  all political power has reverted to its     original source  the people of the nation   with the     monarchy  its several adjuncts died also  wherefore     there is no longer a nobility  no longer a privileged     class  no longer an established church  all men are     become exactly equal  they are upon one common     level  and religion is free    a republic is hereby     proclaimed   as being the natural estate of a nation     when other authority has ceased   it is the duty of     the british people to meet together immediately      and by their votes elect representatives and deliver     into their hands the government      i signed it  the boss   and dated it from merlin s cave   clarence said       why  that tells where we are  and invites them to call right away       that is the idea   we  strike   by the proclamation  then it s  their innings   now have the thing set up and printed and posted   right off  that is  give the order  then  if you ve got a couple  of bicycles handy at the foot of the hill  ho for merlin s cave       i shall be ready in ten minutes   what a cyclone there is going  to be to morrow when this piece of paper gets to work      it s a  pleasant old palace  this is  i wonder if we shall ever again    but never mind about that          chapter xliii    the battle of the sand belt    in merlin s cave   clarence and i and fifty two fresh  bright   well educated  clean minded young british boys   at dawn i sent  an order to the factories and to all our great works to stop  operations and remove all life to a safe distance  as everything  was going to be blown up by secret mines    and no telling at what  moment  therefore  vacate at once     these people knew me  and  had confidence in my word   they would clear out without waiting  to part their hair  and i could take my own time about dating the  explosion   you couldn t hire one of them to go back during the  century  if the explosion was still impending     we had a week of waiting   it was not dull for me  because i was  writing all the time   during the first three days  i finished  turning my old diary into this narrative form  it only required  a chapter or so to bring it down to date   the rest of the week  i took up in writing letters to my wife   it was always my habit  to write to sandy every day  whenever we were separate  and now  i kept up the habit for love of it  and of her  though i couldn t  do anything with the letters  of course  after i had written them   but it put in the time  you see  and was almost like talking   it was almost as if i was saying   sandy  if you and hello central  were here in the cave  instead of only your photographs  what  good times we could have    and then  you know  i could imagine  the baby goo gooing something out in reply  with its fists in its  mouth and itself stretched across its mother s lap on its back   and she a laughing and admiring and worshipping  and now and then  tickling under the baby s chin to set it cackling  and then maybe  throwing in a word of answer to me herself  and so on and so on    well  don t you know  i could sit there in the cave with my pen   and keep it up  that way  by the hour with them   why  it was  almost like having us all together again     i had spies out every night  of course  to get news   every report  made things look more and more impressive   the hosts were gathering   gathering  down all the roads and paths of england the knights were  riding  and priests rode with them  to hearten these original  crusaders  this being the church s war   all the nobilities  big  and little  were on their way  and all the gentry   this was all  as was expected   we should thin out this sort of folk to such  a degree that the people would have nothing to do but just step  to the front with their republic and      ah  what a donkey i was   toward the end of the week i began to get  this large and disenchanting fact through my head  that the mass  of the nation had swung their caps and shouted for the republic for  about one day  and there an end   the church  the nobles  and  the gentry then turned one grand  all disapproving frown upon them  and shriveled them into sheep   from that moment the sheep had  begun to gather to the fold  that is to say  the camps  and offer  their valueless lives and their valuable wool to the  righteous  cause    why  even the very men who had lately been slaves were  in the  righteous cause   and glorifying it  praying for it   sentimentally slabbering over it  just like all the other commoners   imagine such human muck as this  conceive of this folly     yes  it was now  death to the republic   everywhere  not a dissenting  voice   all england was marching against us   truly  this was more  than i had bargained for     i watched my fifty two boys narrowly  watched their faces  their  walk  their unconscious attitudes  for all these are a language    a language given us purposely that it may betray us in times of  emergency  when we have secrets which we want to keep   i knew  that that thought would keep saying itself over and over again  in their minds and hearts   all england is marching against us    and ever more strenuously imploring attention with each repetition   ever more sharply realizing itself to their imaginations  until  even in their sleep they would find no rest from it  but hear  the vague and flitting creatures of the dreams say   all england     all england    is marching against you    i knew all this would  happen  i knew that ultimately the pressure would become so great  that it would compel utterance  therefore  i must be ready with an  answer at that time  an answer well chosen and tranquilizing     i was right   the time came   they had to speak   poor lads  it  was pitiful to see  they were so pale  so worn  so troubled   at  first their spokesman could hardly find voice or words  but he  presently got both   this is what he said  and he put it in the  neat modern english taught him in my schools      we have tried to forget what we are  english boys   we have tried  to put reason before sentiment  duty before love  our minds  approve  but our hearts reproach us   while apparently it was  only the nobility  only the gentry  only the twenty five or thirty  thousand knights left alive out of the late wars  we were of one  mind  and undisturbed by any troubling doubt  each and every one  of these fifty two lads who stand here before you  said   they  have chosen  it is their affair    but think   the matter is  altered   all england is marching against us    oh  sir  consider     reflect   these people are our people  they are bone of our bone   flesh of our flesh  we love them  do not ask us to destroy our nation      well  it shows the value of looking ahead  and being ready for  a thing when it happens   if i hadn t foreseen this thing and been  fixed  that boy would have had me   i couldn t have said a word   but i was fixed   i said      my boys  your hearts are in the right place  you have thought the  worthy thought  you have done the worthy thing   you are english  boys  you will remain english boys  and you will keep that name  unsmirched   give yourselves no further concern  let your minds be  at peace   consider this  while all england is marching against  us  who is in the van   who  by the commonest rules of war  will  march in the front   answer me       the mounted host of mailed knights       true   they are thirty thousand strong   acres deep they will march   now  observe  none but  they  will ever strike the sand belt   then  there will be an episode   immediately after  the civilian multitude  in the rear will retire  to meet business engagements elsewhere   none but nobles and gentry are knights  and  none but these  will  remain to dance to our music after that episode   it is absolutely  true that we shall have to fight nobody but these thirty thousand  knights   now speak  and it shall be as you decide   shall we  avoid the battle  retire from the field       no        the shout was unanimous and hearty      are you  are you  well  afraid of these thirty thousand knights      that joke brought out a good laugh  the boys  troubles vanished  away  and they went gaily to their posts   ah  they were a darling  fifty two   as pretty as girls  too     i was ready for the enemy now   let the approaching big day come  along  it would find us on deck     the big day arrived on time   at dawn the sentry on watch in the  corral came into the cave and reported a moving black mass under  the horizon  and a faint sound which he thought to be military  music   breakfast was just ready  we sat down and ate it     this over  i made the boys a little speech  and then sent out  a detail to man the battery  with clarence in command of it     the sun rose presently and sent its unobstructed splendors over  the land  and we saw a prodigious host moving slowly toward us   with the steady drift and aligned front of a wave of the sea   nearer and nearer it came  and more and more sublimely imposing  became its aspect  yes  all england was there  apparently   soon  we could see the innumerable banners fluttering  and then the sun  struck the sea of armor and set it all aflash   yes  it was a fine  sight  i hadn t ever seen anything to beat it     at last we could make out details   all the front ranks  no telling  how many acres deep  were horsemen  plumed knights in armor   suddenly we heard the blare of trumpets  the slow walk burst into  a gallop  and then  well  it was wonderful to see   down swept  that vast horse shoe wave  it approached the sand belt  my breath  stood still  nearer  nearer  the strip of green turf beyond the  yellow belt grew narrow  narrower still  became a mere ribbon in  front of the horses  then disappeared under their hoofs   great  scott   why  the whole front of that host shot into the sky with  a thunder crash  and became a whirling tempest of rags and fragments   and along the ground lay a thick wall of smoke that hid what was  left of the multitude from our sight     time for the second step in the plan of campaign   i touched  a button  and shook the bones of england loose from her spine     in that explosion all our noble civilization factories went up in  the air and disappeared from the earth   it was a pity  but it  was necessary   we could not afford to let the enemy turn our own  weapons against us     now ensued one of the dullest quarter hours i had ever endured   we waited in a silent solitude enclosed by our circles of wire   and by a circle of heavy smoke outside of these   we couldn t  see over the wall of smoke  and we couldn t see through it   but  at last it began to shred away lazily  and by the end of another  quarter hour the land was clear and our curiosity was enabled  to satisfy itself   no living creature was in sight   we now  perceived that additions had been made to our defenses   the  dynamite had dug a ditch more than a hundred feet wide  all around  us  and cast up an embankment some twenty five feet high on both  borders of it   as to destruction of life  it was amazing   moreover   it was beyond estimate   of course  we could not  count  the dead   because they did not exist as individuals  but merely as homogeneous  protoplasm  with alloys of iron and buttons     no life was in sight  but necessarily there must have been some  wounded in the rear ranks  who were carried off the field under  cover of the wall of smoke  there would be sickness among the  others  there always is  after an episode like that   but there  would be no reinforcements  this was the last stand of the chivalry  of england  it was all that was left of the order  after the recent  annihilating wars   so i felt quite safe in believing that the  utmost force that could for the future be brought against us  would be but small  that is  of knights   i therefore issued a  congratulatory proclamation to my army in these words        soldiers  champions of human liberty and equality      your general congratulates you   in the pride of his     strength and the vanity of his renown  an arrogant     enemy came against you   you were ready   the conflict     was brief  on your side  glorious   this mighty     victory  having been achieved utterly without loss      stands without example in history   so long as the     planets shall continue to move in their orbits  the     battle of the sand belt will not perish out of the     memories of men                                     the boss     i read it well  and the applause i got was very gratifying to me   i then wound up with these remarks      the war with the english nation  as a nation  is at an end   the nation has retired from the field and the war   before it can  be persuaded to return  war will have ceased   this campaign is  the only one that is going to be fought   it will be brief    the briefest in history   also the most destructive to life   considered from the standpoint of proportion of casualties to  numbers engaged   we are done with the nation  henceforth we deal  only with the knights   english knights can be killed  but they  cannot be conquered   we know what is before us   while one of  these men remains alive  our task is not finished  the war is not  ended   we will kill them all     loud and long continued applause      i picketed the great embankments thrown up around our lines by  the dynamite explosion  merely a lookout of a couple of boys  to announce the enemy when he should appear again     next  i sent an engineer and forty men to a point just beyond  our lines on the south  to turn a mountain brook that was there   and bring it within our lines and under our command  arranging  it in such a way that i could make instant use of it in an emergency   the forty men were divided into two shifts of twenty each  and  were to relieve each other every two hours   in ten hours the  work was accomplished     it was nightfall now  and i withdrew my pickets   the one who  had had the northern outlook reported a camp in sight  but visible  with the glass only   he also reported that a few knights had been  feeling their way toward us  and had driven some cattle across our  lines  but that the knights themselves had not come very near   that was what i had been expecting   they were feeling us  you  see  they wanted to know if we were going to play that red terror  on them again   they would grow bolder in the night  perhaps   i believed i knew what project they would attempt  because it was  plainly the thing i would attempt myself if i were in their places  and as ignorant as they were   i mentioned it to clarence      i think you are right   said he   it is the obvious thing for  them to try       well  then   i said   if they do it they are doomed       certainly       they won t have the slightest show in the world       of course they won t       it s dreadful  clarence   it seems an awful pity      the thing disturbed me so that i couldn t get any peace of mind  for thinking of it and worrying over it   so  at last  to quiet  my conscience  i framed this message to the knights        to the honorable the commander of the insurgent     chivalry of england  you fight in vain   we know     your strength  if one may call it by that name      we know that at the utmost you cannot bring     against us above five and twenty thousand knights      therefore  you have no chance  none whatever      reflect  we are well equipped  well fortified  we     number      fifty four what   men   no  minds  the     capablest in the world  a force against which     mere animal might may no more hope to prevail than     may the idle waves of the sea hope to prevail     against the granite barriers of england   be advised      we offer you your lives  for the sake of your     families  do not reject the gift   we offer you     this chance  and it is the last  throw down your     arms  surrender unconditionally to the republic      and all will be forgiven                                signed  the boss     i read it to clarence  and said i proposed to send it by a flag  of truce   he laughed the sarcastic laugh he was born with  and said      somehow it seems impossible for you to ever fully realize what  these nobilities are   now let us save a little time and trouble   consider me the commander of the knights yonder   now  then   you are the flag of truce  approach and deliver me your message   and i will give you your answer      i humored the idea   i came forward under an imaginary guard of  the enemy s soldiers  produced my paper  and read it through   for answer  clarence struck the paper out of my hand  pursed up  a scornful lip and said with lofty disdain      dismember me this animal  and return him in a basket to the  base born knave who sent him  other answer have i none      how empty is theory in presence of fact   and this was just fact   and nothing else   it was the thing that would have happened   there was no getting around that   i tore up the paper and granted  my mistimed sentimentalities a permanent rest     then  to business   i tested the electric signals from the gatling  platform to the cave  and made sure that they were all right   i tested and retested those which commanded the fences  these  were signals whereby i could break and renew the electric current  in each fence independently of the others at will   i placed the  brook connection under the guard and authority of three of my  best boys  who would alternate in two hour watches all night and  promptly obey my signal  if i should have occasion to give it    three revolver shots in quick succession   sentry duty was discarded  for the night  and the corral left empty of life  i ordered that  quiet be maintained in the cave  and the electric lights turned  down to a glimmer     as soon as it was good and dark  i shut off the current from all  the fences  and then groped my way out to the embankment bordering  our side of the great dynamite ditch   i crept to the top of it  and lay there on the slant of the muck to watch   but it was  too dark to see anything   as for sounds  there were none   the  stillness was deathlike   true  there were the usual night sounds  of the country  the whir of night birds  the buzzing of insects   the barking of distant dogs  the mellow lowing of far off kine    but these didn t seem to break the stillness  they only intensified  it  and added a grewsome melancholy to it into the bargain     i presently gave up looking  the night shut down so black  but  i kept my ears strained to catch the least suspicious sound  for  i judged i had only to wait  and i shouldn t be disappointed   however  i had to wait a long time   at last i caught what you  may call in distinct glimpses of sound dulled metallic sound   i pricked up my ears  then  and held my breath  for this was the  sort of thing i had been waiting for   this sound thickened  and  approached  from toward the north   presently  i heard it at my  own level  the ridge top of the opposite embankment  a hundred  feet or more away   then i seemed to see a row of black dots appear  along that ridge  human heads   i couldn t tell  it mightn t be  anything at all  you can t depend on your eyes when your imagination  is out of focus   however  the question was soon settled   i heard  that metallic noise descending into the great ditch   it augmented  fast  it spread all along  and it unmistakably furnished me this  fact  an armed host was taking up its quarters in the ditch   yes   these people were arranging a little surprise party for us   we  could expect entertainment about dawn  possibly earlier     i groped my way back to the corral now  i had seen enough   i went  to the platform and signaled to turn the current on to the two  inner fences   then i went into the cave  and found everything  satisfactory there  nobody awake but the working watch   i woke  clarence and told him the great ditch was filling up with men   and that i believed all the knights were coming for us in a body   it was my notion that as soon as dawn approached we could expect  the ditch s ambuscaded thousands to swarm up over the embankment  and make an assault  and be followed immediately by the rest  of their army     clarence said      they will be wanting to send a scout or two in the dark to make  preliminary observations   why not take the lightning off the  outer fences  and give them a chance       i ve already done it  clarence   did you ever know me to be  inhospitable       no  you are a good heart   i want to go and        be a reception committee   i will go  too      we crossed the corral and lay down together between the two inside  fences   even the dim light of the cave had disordered our eyesight  somewhat  but the focus straightway began to regulate itself and  soon it was adjusted for present circumstances   we had had to feel  our way before  but we could make out to see the fence posts now   we started a whispered conversation  but suddenly clarence broke  off and said      what is that       what is what       that thing yonder       what thing  where       there beyond you a little piece  dark something  a dull shape  of some kind  against the second fence      i gazed and he gazed   i said      could it be a man  clarence       no  i think not   if you notice  it looks a lit  why  it  is   a man   leaning on the fence       i certainly believe it is  let us go and see      we crept along on our hands and knees until we were pretty close   and then looked up   yes  it was a man  a dim great figure in armor   standing erect  with both hands on the upper wire  and  of course   there was a smell of burning flesh   poor fellow  dead as a  door nail  and never knew what hurt him   he stood there like a  statue  no motion about him  except that his plumes swished about  a little in the night wind   we rose up and looked in through  the bars of his visor  but couldn t make out whether we knew him  or not  features too dim and shadowed     we heard muffled sounds approaching  and we sank down to the ground  where we were   we made out another knight vaguely  he was coming  very stealthily  and feeling his way   he was near enough now for  us to see him put out a hand  find an upper wire  then bend and  step under it and over the lower one   now he arrived at the  first knight  and started slightly when he discovered him   he  stood a moment  no doubt wondering why the other one didn t move  on  then he said  in a low voice   why dreamest thou here  good  sir mar    then he laid his hand on the corpse s shoulder  and just  uttered a little soft moan and sunk down dead   killed by a dead  man  you see  killed by a dead friend  in fact   there was something  awful about it     these early birds came scattering along after each other  about  one every five minutes in our vicinity  during half an hour   they brought no armor of offense but their swords  as a rule   they carried the sword ready in the hand  and put it forward and  found the wires with it   we would now and then see a blue spark  when the knight that caused it was so far away as to be invisible  to us  but we knew what had happened  all the same  poor fellow   he had touched a charged wire with his sword and been elected   we had brief intervals of grim stillness  interrupted with piteous  regularity by the clash made by the falling of an iron clad  and  this sort of thing was going on  right along  and was very creepy  there in the dark and lonesomeness     we concluded to make a tour between the inner fences   we elected  to walk upright  for convenience s sake  we argued that if discerned   we should be taken for friends rather than enemies  and in any case  we should be out of reach of swords  and these gentry did not seem  to have any spears along   well  it was a curious trip   everywhere  dead men were lying outside the second fence  not plainly visible   but still visible  and we counted fifteen of those pathetic  statues  dead knights standing with their hands on the upper wire     one thing seemed to be sufficiently demonstrated  our current  was so tremendous that it killed before the victim could cry out   pretty soon we detected a muffled and heavy sound  and next moment  we guessed what it was   it was a surprise in force coming  whispered  clarence to go and wake the army  and notify it to wait in silence  in the cave for further orders   he was soon back  and we stood  by the inner fence and watched the silent lightning do its awful  work upon that swarming host   one could make out but little of  detail  but he could note that a black mass was piling itself up  beyond the second fence   that swelling bulk was dead men   our  camp was enclosed with a solid wall of the dead  a bulwark   a breastwork  of corpses  you may say   one terrible thing about  this thing was the absence of human voices  there were no cheers   no war cries  being intent upon a surprise  these men moved as  noiselessly as they could  and always when the front rank was near  enough to their goal to make it proper for them to begin to get  a shout ready  of course they struck the fatal line and went down  without testifying     i sent a current through the third fence now  and almost immediately  through the fourth and fifth  so quickly were the gaps filled up   i believed the time was come now for my climax  i believed that  that whole army was in our trap   anyway  it was high time to find  out   so i touched a button and set fifty electric suns aflame  on the top of our precipice     land  what a sight   we were enclosed in three walls of dead men   all the other fences were pretty nearly filled with the living   who were stealthily working their way forward through the wires   the sudden glare paralyzed this host  petrified them  you may say   with astonishment  there was just one instant for me to utilize  their immobility in  and i didn t lose the chance   you see  in  another instant they would have recovered their faculties  then  they d have burst into a cheer and made a rush  and my wires  would have gone down before it  but that lost instant lost them  their opportunity forever  while even that slight fragment of time  was still unspent  i shot the current through all the fences and  struck the whole host dead in their tracks    there  was a groan  you could  hear    it voiced the death pang of eleven thousand men   it swelled out on the night with awful pathos     a glance showed that the rest of the enemy  perhaps ten thousand  strong  were between us and the encircling ditch  and pressing  forward to the assault   consequently we had them  all   and had  them past help   time for the last act of the tragedy   i fired  the three appointed revolver shots  which meant      turn on the water      there was a sudden rush and roar  and in a minute the mountain  brook was raging through the big ditch and creating a river a  hundred feet wide and twenty five deep      stand to your guns  men   open fire      the thirteen gatlings began to vomit death into the fated ten  thousand   they halted  they stood their ground a moment against  that withering deluge of fire  then they broke  faced about and  swept toward the ditch like chaff before a gale   a full fourth  part of their force never reached the top of the lofty embankment   the three fourths reached it and plunged over  to death by drowning     within ten short minutes after we had opened fire  armed resistance  was totally annihilated  the campaign was ended  we fifty four were  masters of england   twenty five thousand men lay dead around us     but how treacherous is fortune   in a little while  say an hour    happened a thing  by my own fault  which  but i have no heart  to write that   let the record end here         chapter xliv    a postscript by clarence    i  clarence  must write it for him   he proposed that we two  go out and see if any help could be accorded the wounded   i was  strenuous against the project   i said that if there were many   we could do but little for them  and it would not be wise for us to  trust ourselves among them  anyway   but he could seldom be turned  from a purpose once formed  so we shut off the electric current  from the fences  took an escort along  climbed over the enclosing  ramparts of dead knights  and moved out upon the field   the first  wounded mall who appealed for help was sitting with his back  against a dead comrade   when the boss bent over him and spoke  to him  the man recognized him and stabbed him   that knight was  sir meliagraunce  as i found out by tearing off his helmet   he  will not ask for help any more     we carried the boss to the cave and gave his wound  which was  not very serious  the best care we could   in this service we had  the help of merlin  though we did not know it   he was disguised  as a woman  and appeared to be a simple old peasant goodwife   in this disguise  with brown stained face and smooth shaven  he  had appeared a few days after the boss was hurt and offered to cook  for us  saying her people had gone off to join certain new camps  which the enemy were forming  and that she was starving   the boss  had been getting along very well  and had amused himself with  finishing up his record     we were glad to have this woman  for we were short handed   we  were in a trap  you see  a trap of our own making   if we stayed  where we were  our dead would kill us  if we moved out of our  defenses  we should no longer be invincible   we had conquered   in turn we were conquered   the boss recognized this  we all  recognized it   if we could go to one of those new camps and  patch up some kind of terms with the enemy  yes  but the boss  could not go  and neither could i  for i was among the first that  were made sick by the poisonous air bred by those dead thousands   others were taken down  and still others   to morrow       to morrow    it is here   and with it the end   about midnight  i awoke  and saw that hag making curious passes in the air about  the boss s head and face  and wondered what it meant   everybody  but the dynamo watch lay steeped in sleep  there was no sound   the woman ceased from her mysterious foolery  and started tip toeing  toward the door   i called out      stop   what have you been doing      she halted  and said with an accent of malicious satisfaction      ye were conquerors  ye are conquered   these others are perishing    you also   ye shall all die in this place  every one  except  him    he sleepeth now  and shall sleep thirteen centuries   i am merlin      then such a delirium of silly laughter overtook him that he reeled  about like a drunken man  and presently fetched up against one  of our wires   his mouth is spread open yet  apparently he is still  laughing   i suppose the face will retain that petrified laugh until  the corpse turns to dust     the boss has never stirred  sleeps like a stone   if he does not  wake to day we shall understand what kind of a sleep it is  and  his body will then be borne to a place in one of the remote recesses  of the cave where none will ever find it to desecrate it   as for  the rest of us  well  it is agreed that if any one of us ever  escapes alive from this place  he will write the fact here  and  loyally hide this manuscript with the boss  our dear good chief   whose property it is  be he alive or dead         the end of the manuscript            final p s  by m t     the dawn was come when i laid the manuscript aside   the rain  had almost ceased  the world was gray and sad  the exhausted storm  was sighing and sobbing itself to rest   i went to the stranger s  room  and listened at his door  which was slightly ajar   i could  hear his voice  and so i knocked   there was no answer  but i still  heard the voice   i peeped in   the man lay on his back in bed   talking brokenly but with spirit  and punctuating with his arms   which he thrashed about  restlessly  as sick people do in delirium   i slipped in softly and bent over him   his mutterings and  ejaculations went on   i spoke  merely a word  to call his attention   his glassy eyes and his ashy face were alight in an instant with  pleasure  gratitude  gladness  welcome      oh  sandy  you are come at last  how i have longed for you   sit  by me  do not leave me  never leave me again  sandy  never again   where is your hand   give it me  dear  let me hold it  there    now all is well  all is peace  and i am happy again   we  are happy  again  isn t it so  sandy   you are so dim  so vague  you are but  a mist  a cloud  but you are  here   and that is blessedness sufficient

when she wakes  and let me touch her hands  her face  her hair   and tell her good bye      sandy   yes  you are there   i lost  myself a moment  and i thought you were gone      have i been  sick long   it must be so  it seems months to me   and such dreams   such strange and awful dreams  sandy   dreams that were as real  as reality  delirium  of course  but  so  real   why  i thought  the king was dead  i thought you were in gaul and couldn t get  home  i thought there was a revolution  in the fantastic frenzy  of these dreams  i thought that clarence and i and a handful of  my cadets fought and exterminated the whole chivalry of england   but even that was not the strangest   i seemed to be a creature  out of a remote unborn age  centuries hence  and even  that  was  as real as the rest   yes  i seemed to have flown back out of that  age into this of ours  and then forward to it again  and was set  down  a stranger and forlorn in that strange england  with an  abyss of thirteen centuries yawning between me and you  between  me and my home and my friends  between me and all that is dear  to me  all that could make life worth the living   it was awful    awfuler than you can ever imagine  sandy   ah  watch by me  sandy    stay by me every moment   don t  let me go out of my mind again   death is nothing  let it come  but not with those dreams  not with  the torture of those hideous dreams  i cannot endure  that  again      sandy         he lay muttering incoherently some little time  then for a time he  lay silent  and apparently sinking away toward death   presently  his fingers began to pick busily at the coverlet  and by that sign  i knew that his end was at hand with the first suggestion of the  death rattle in his throat he started up slightly  and seemed  to listen  then he said      a bugle      it is the king   the drawbridge  there   man the  battlements   turn out the       he was getting up his last  effect   but he never

this are manifold  but three may be  especially noted  his broad human sympathies  his vigorous common sense   and his consummate mastery of expression  the mind must be either  singularly barren or singularly cold to which horace does not speak  the  scholar  the statesman  the soldier  the man of the world  the town bred  man  the lover of the country  the thoughtful and the careless  he who  reads much  and he who reads little  all find in his pages more or  less to amuse their fancy  to touch their feelings  to quicken their  observation  to nerve their convictions  to put into happy phrase the  deductions of their experience  his poetical sentiment is not pitched in  too high a key for the unimaginative  but it is always so genuine that  the most imaginative feel its charm  his wisdom is deeper than it seems   so simple  practical  and direct as it is in its application  and his  moral teaching more spiritual and penetrating than is apparent on a  superficial study  he does not fall into the common error of didactic  writers  of laying upon life more than it will bear  but he insists that  it shall at least bear the fruits of integrity  truth  honour  justice   self denial  and brotherly charity  over and above the mere literary  charm of his works  too  and herein  perhaps  lies no small part of the  secret of his popularity  the warm heart and thoroughly urbane nature of  the man are felt instinctively by his readers  and draw them to him as  to a friend     hence it is that we find he has been a manual with men the most diverse  in their natures  culture

he says   in every  journey  horace was always in my pocket  and often in my hand   and  as it has been  so it is  in many a pocket  where this might be least  expected  lies a well thumbed horace  and in many a devout christian  heart the maxims of the gentle  genial pagan find a place near the  higher teachings of a greater master     where so much of a writer s charm lies  as with horace  in exquisite  aptness of language  and in a style perfect for fulness of suggestion  combined with brevity and grace  the task of indicating his  characteristics in translation demands the most liberal allowance from  the reader  in this volume the writer has gladly availed himself   where he might  of the privilege liberally accorded to him to use the  admirable translations of the late mr conington  which are distinguished  in all cases by the addition of his initial  the other translations are  the writer s own  for these it would be superfluous to claim indulgence   this is sure to be granted by those who know their horace well  with  those who do not  these translations will not be wholly useless  if they  serve to pique them into cultivating an acquaintance with the original  sufficiently close to justify them in turning critics of their defects           quintus horatius flaccus     born  a u c       b c      died  a u c       b c            chapter i     birth   education   campaign with brutus and cassius       like the two greatest lyrists of modern times  burns and beranger   horace sprang from the ranks of the people  his father had been a slave   and he was himself cradled among  the huts where poor men lie   like  these great lyrists  too  horace was proud of his origin  after he had  become the intimate associate of the first men in rome  nay  the bosom  friend of the generals and statesmen who ruled the world  he was at  pains on more occasions than one to call attention to the fact of his  humble birth  and to let it be known that  had he to begin life anew   he was so far from desiring a better ancestry that he would  like andrew  marvell  have made  his destiny his choice   nor is this done with the  pretentious affectation of the parvenu  eager to bring under notice the  contrast between what he is and what he has been  and to insinuate his  personal deserts  while pretending to disclaim them  horace has no such  false humility  he was proud  and he makes no secret that he was so  of  the name he had made   proud of it for himself and for the class from  which  he had sprung  but it was his practice  as well as his settled  creed  to rate at little the accidents of birth and fortune  a  stronger and higher feeling  however  more probably dictated the  avowal   gratitude to that slave born father whose character and careful  training had stamped an abiding influence upon the life and genius of  his son  neither might he have been unwilling in this way quietly to  protest against the worship of rank and wealth which he saw everywhere  around him  and which was demoralising society in rome  the favourite of  the emperor  the companion of maecenas  did not himself forget  neither  would he let others forget  that he was a freedman s son  and in his own  way was glad to declare  as beranger did of himself at the height of his  fame          je suis vilain  et tres vilain      the roman poets of the pre augustan and augustan periods  unlike horace   were all well born  catullus and calvus  his great predecessors in lyric  poetry  were men of old and noble family virgil  born five years before  horace  was the son of a roman citizen of good property  tibullus   propertius  and ovid  who were respectively six  fourteen  and twenty  years his juniors  were all of equestrian rank  horace s father was a  freed man of the town of venusia  the modern venosa  it is supposed that  he had been a  publicus servus   or slave of the community  and took  his distinctive name from the horatian tribe  to which the community  belonged  he had saved a moderate competency in the vocation of   coactor   a name applied both to the collectors of public revenue  and of money at sales by public auction  to which of these classes he  belonged is uncertain  most probably to the latter  and in those days of  frequent confiscations  when property was constantly changing hands   the profits of his calling  at best a poor one  may have been unusually  large  with the fruits of his industry he had purchased a small farm  near venusia  upon the banks of the aufidus  the modern ofanto  on the  confines of lucania and apulia  here  on the  th of december  b c       the poet was born  and this picturesque region of mountain  forest  and  river   meet nurse of a poetic child   impressed itself indelibly on his  memory  and imbued him with the love of nature  especially in her rugged  aspect  which remained with him through life  he appears to have left  the locality in early life  and never to have revisited it  but when he  has occasion to describe its features  odes  iii      he does this with  a sharpness and truth of touch  which show how closely he had even then  begun to observe  acherontia  perched nest like among the rocks  the  bantine thickets  the fat meadows of low lying forentum  which his  boyish eye had noted  attest to this hour the vivid accuracy of his  description  the passage in question records an interesting incident in  the poet s childhood  escaping from his nurse  he has rambled away  from the little cottage on the slopes of mount vultur  whither he had  probably been taken from the sultry venusia to pass his  villeggiatura   during the heat of summer  and is found asleep  covered with fresh  myrtle and laurel leaves  in which the wood pigeons have swathed him        when from my nurse erewhile  on vultur s steep       i stray d beyond the bound      of our small homestead s ground     was i  fatigued with play  beneath a heap      of fresh leaves sleeping found          strewn by the storied doves  and wonder fell      on all  their nest who keep      on acherontia s steep     or in forentum s low rich pastures dwell       or bantine woodlands deep        that safe from bears and adders in such place      i lay  and slumbering smiled       o erstrewn with myrtle wild     and laurel  by the god s peculiar grace      no craven hearted child      the incident thus recorded is not necessarily discredited by the  circumstance of its being closely akin to what is told by aelian of  pindar  that a swarm of bees settled upon his lips  and fed him with  honey  when he was left exposed upon the highway  it probably had some  foundation in fact  whatever may be thought of the implied augury of the  special favour of the gods which is said to have been drawn from it  at the time  in any case  the picture of the strayed child  sleeping  unconscious of its danger  with its hands full of wild flowers  is  pleasant to contemplate     in his father s house  and in those of the apulian peasantry around  him  horace became familiar with the simple virtues of the poor  their  industry and independence  their integrity  chastity  and self denial   which he loved to contrast in after years with the luxury and vice of  imperial rome  his mother he would seem to have lost early  no mention  of her occurs  directly or indirectly  throughout his poems  and  remarkable as horace is for the warmth of his affections  this could  scarcely have happened had she not died when he was very young  he  appears also to have been an only child  this doubtless drew him closer  to his father  and the want of the early influences of mother or sister  may serve to explain why one misses in his poetry something of that  gracious tenderness towards womanhood  which  looking to the sweet and  loving disposition of the man  one might otherwise have expected to find  in it  that he was no common boy we may be very sure  even if this were  not manifest from the fact that his father resolved to give him a higher  education than was to be obtained under a provincial schoolmaster  with  this view  although little able to afford the expense  he took his son   when about twelve years old  to rome  and gave him the best education  the capital could supply  no money was spared to enable him to keep his  position among his fellow scholars of the higher ranks  he was waited on  by several slaves  as though he were the heir to a considerable fortune   at the same time  however  he was not allowed either to feel any shame  for his own order  or to aspire to a position which his patrimony  was unable to maintain  his father taught him to look forward to some  situation akin to that in which his own modest competency had been  acquired  and to feel that  in any sphere  culture  self respect   and prudent self control must command influence  and afford the best  guarantee for happiness  in reading this part of horace s story  as  he tells it himself  one is reminded of burns s early lines about his  father and himself          my father was a farmer upon the carrick border     and carefully he bred me up in decency and order     he bade me act a manly part  though i had ne er a farthing     for without an honest manly heart no man was worth regarding      the parallel might be still further pursued   my father   says gilbert  burns   was for some time almost the only companion we had  he conversed  familiarly on all subjects with us as if we had been men  and was at  great pains  while we accompanied him in the labours of the farm  to  lead the conversation to such subjects as might tend to increase our  knowledge  or confirm us in virtuous habits   how closely this resembles  the method adopted with horace by his father will be seen hereafter    footnote  compare it  too  with what horace reports of  ofellus the  hind  though no scholar  a sage of exceptional kind   in the second  satire of the second book  from line     to the end      horace s literary master at rome was orbilius pupillus  a grammarian   who had carried into his school his martinet habits as an old soldier   and who  thanks to horace  has become a name   plagosus orbilius    orbilius of the birch  eagerly applied by many a suffering urchin  to modern pedagogues who have resorted to the same material means of  inculcating the beauties of the classics  by this busby of the period  horace was grounded in greek  and made familiar  too familiar for his  liking  with ennius  naevius  pacuvius  attius  livius andronicus  and  other early latin writers  whose unpruned vigour was distasteful to  one who had already begun to appreciate the purer and not less vigorous  style of homer and other greek authors  horace s father took care that  he should acquire all the accomplishments of a roman gentleman  in which  music and rhetoric were  as a matter of course  included  but  what  was of still more importance during this critical period of the future  poet s first introduction to the seductions of the capital  he enjoyed  the advantages of his father s personal superintendence and of a careful  moral training  his father went with him to all his classes  and  being  himself a man of shrewd observation and natural humour  he gave the  boy s studies a practical bearing by directing his attention to the  follies and vices of the luxurious and dissolute society around him   showing him how incompatible they were with the dictates of reason and  common sense  and how disastrous in their consequences to the good name  and happiness of those who yielded to their seductions  the method he  pursued is thus described by horace  satires  i              should then my humorous vein run wild  some latitude allow     i learned the habit from the best of fathers  who employed    some living type to stamp the vice he wished me to avoid     thus temperate and frugal when exhorting me to be     and with the competence content which he had stored for me      look  boy   he d say   at albius  son  observe his sorry plight     and barrus  that poor beggar there  say  are not these a sight     to warn a man from squandering his patrimonial means      when counselling me to keep from vile amours with common queans      sectanus  ape him not   he d say  or  urging to forswear    intrigue with matrons  when i might taste lawful joys elsewhere      trebonius  fame is blurred since he was in the manner caught     the reasons why this should be shunned  and why that should be    sought     the sages will explain  enough for me  if i uphold    the faith and morals handed down from our good sires of old     and  while you need a guardian  keep your life pure and your name     when years have hardened  as they will  your judgment and your    frame     you ll swim without a float   and so  with talk like this  he won    and moulded me  while yet a boy  was something to be done     hard it might be   for this   he d say   good warrant you can    quote       and then as model pointed to some public man of note     or was there something to be shunned  then he would urge   can you    one moment doubt that acts like these are base and futile too     which have to him and him such dire disgrace and trouble bred      and as a neighbour s death appals the sick  and  by the dread    of dying  forces them to put upon their lusts restraint     so tender minds are oft deterred from vices by the taint    they see them bring on others  names   tis thus that i from those    am all exempt  which bring with them a train of shames and woes      nor did horace only inherit from his father  as he here says  the kindly  humour and practical good sense which distinguish his satirical and  didactic writings  and that manly independence which he preserved  through the temptations of a difficult career  many of  the rugged  maxims hewn from life  with which his works abound are manifestly but  echoes of what the poet had heard from his father s lips  like his  own ofellus  and the elders of the race  not  let us hope  altogether  bygone  of peasant farmers in scotland  described by wordsworth as   religious men  who give to god and men their dues    the apulian  freedman had a fund of homely wisdom at command  not gathered from  books  but instinct with the freshness and force of direct observation  and personal conviction  the following exquisite tribute by horace  to his worth is conclusive evidence how often and how deeply he had  occasion to be grateful  not only for the affectionate care of this  admirable father  but also for the bias and strength which that father s  character had given to his own  it has a further interest  as occurring  in a poem addressed to maecenas  a man of ancient family and vast  wealth  in the early days of that acquaintance with the poet which was  afterwards to ripen into a lifelong friendship        yet if some trivial faults  and these but few     my nature  else not much amiss  imbue     just as you wish away  yet scarcely blame     a mole or two upon a comely frame      if no man may arraign me of the vice    of lewdness  meanness  nor of avarice     if pure and innocent i live  and dear    to those i love  self praise is venial here      all this i owe my father  who  though poor     lord of some few lean acres  and no more     was loath to send me to the village school     whereto the sons of men of mark and rule       centurions  and the like   were wont to swarm     with slate and satchel on sinister arm     and the poor dole of scanty pence to pay    the starveling teacher on the quarter day     but boldly took me  when a boy  to rome     there to be taught all arts that grace the home    of knight and senator  to see my dress     and slaves attending  you d have thought  no less    than patrimonial fortunes old and great    had furnished forth the charges of my state     when with my tutors  he would still be by     nor ever let me wander from his eye     and  in a word  he kept me chaste  and this    is virtue s crown  from all that was amiss     nor such in act alone  but in repute     till even scandal s tattling voice was mute     no dread had he that men might taunt or jeer     should i  some future day  as auctioneer     or  like himself  as tax collector  seek    with petty fees my humble means to eke     nor should i then have murmured  now i know     more earnest thanks  and loftier praise i owe     reason must fail me  ere i cease to own    with pride  that i have such a father known     nor shall i stoop my birth to vindicate     by charging  like the herd  the wrong on fate     that i was not of noble lineage sprung     far other creed inspires my heart and tongue     for now should nature bid all living men    retrace their years  and live them o er again     each culling  as his inclination bent     his parents for himself  with mine content     i would not choose whom men endow as great    with the insignia and seats of state     and  though i seemed insane to vulgar eyes     thou wouldst perchance esteem me truly wise     in thus refusing to assume the care    of irksome state i was unused to bear      the education  of which horace s father had laid the foundation at rome   would not have been complete without a course of study at athens  then  the capital of literature and philosophy  as rome was of political  power  thither horace went somewhere between the age of    and      at  rome   he says  epistles  ii  ii             i had my schooling  and was taught    achilles  wrath  and all the woes it brought     at classic athens  where i went ere long     i learned to draw the line  twixt right and wrong     and search for truth  if so she might be seen     in academic groves of blissful green    c      at athens he found many young men of the leading roman  families  bibulus  messalla  corvinus  the younger cicero  and  others  engaged in the same pursuits with himself  and he contracted  among them many enduring friendships  in the political lull which ensued  between the battle of pharsalia  b c      and the death of julius caesar   b c       he was enabled to devote himself without interruption to the  studies which had drawn him to that home of literature and the arts  but  these were destined before long to be rudely broken  the tidings of that  startling event had been hailed with delight by the youthful spirits   some of whom saw in the downfall of the great dictator the dawn of a new  era of liberty  while others hoped from it the return to power of the  aristocratic party to which they belonged  in this mood brutus found  them when he arrived in athens along with cassius  on their way to take  command of the eastern provinces which had been assigned to them by the  senate  cassius hurried on to his post in syria  but brutus lingered  behind  ostensibly absorbed in the philosophical studies of the schools   but at the same time recruiting a staff of officers for his army from  among the young romans of wealth and family whom it was important he  should attach to his party  and who were all eagerness to make his  cause their own  horace  infected by the general enthusiasm  joined his  standard  and  though then only twenty two  without experience  and with  no special aptitude  physical or mental  for a military life  he was  intrusted by brutus with the command of a legion  there is no reason to  suppose that he owed a command of such importance to any dearth of men  of good family qualified to act as officers  it is  therefore  only  reasonable to conclude  that even at this early period he was recognised  in the brilliant society around him as a man of mark  and that brutus   before selecting him  had thoroughly satisfied himself that he possessed  qualities which justified so great a deviation from ordinary rules   as the commission of so responsible a charge to a freedman s son  that  horace gave his commander satisfaction we know from himself  the line   epistles  i  xx         me primis urbis belli placuisse domique            at home  as in the field  i made my way     and kept it  with the first men of the day        can be read in no other sense  but while horace had  beyond all doubt   made himself a strong party of friends who could appreciate his genius  and attractive qualities  his appointment as military tribune excited  jealousy among some of his brother officers  who considered that the  command of a roman legion should have been reserved for men of nobler  blood  a jealousy at which he said  with his usual modesty  many years  afterwards  satires  i  vi       he had no reason either to be surprised  or to complain     in b c      brutus  with his army  passed from macedonia to join cassius  in asia minor  and horace took his part in their subsequent active and  brilliant campaign there  of this we get some slight incidental glimpses  in his works  thus  for example  odes  ii      we find him reminding his  comrade  pompeius varus  how       full oft they sped the lingering day    quaffing bright wine  as in our tents we lay     with syrian spikenard on our glistening hair      the syrian spikenard   malobathrum syrium   fixes the locality  again   in the epistle to his friend bullatius  epistles  i       who is  making a tour in asia  horace speaks of several places as if from vivid  recollection  in his usual dramatic manner  he makes bullatius answer  his inquiries as to how he likes the places he has seen           you know what lebedos is like   so bare     with gabii or fidenae  twould compare     yet there  methinks  i would accept my lot     my friends forgetting  by my friends forgot     stand on the cliff at distance  and survey    the stormy sea god s wild titanic play    c      horace himself had manifestly watched the angry surges from the cliffs  of lebedos  but a more interesting record of the asiatic campaign   inasmuch as it is probably the earliest specimen of horace s writing  which we have  occurs in the seventh satire of the first book  persius   a rich trader of clazomene  has a lawsuit with rupilius  one of brutus s  officers  who went by the nickname of  king   brutus  in his character  of quaestor  has to decide the dispute  which in the hands of the  principals degenerates  as disputes so conducted generally do  into a  personal squabble  persius leads off with some oriental flattery of the  general and his suite  brutus is  asia s sun   and they the  propitious  stars   all but rupilius  who was                             that pest     the dog  whom husbandmen detest      rupilius  an old hand at slang  replies with a volley of rough sarcasms    such as among the vineyards fly   and                    would make the passer by    shout filthy names  but shouting fly       a description of vintage slang which is as true to day as it was then   the conclusion is curious  as a punning allusion to the hereditary fame  of brutus as a puller down of kings  which it must have required some  courage to publish  when augustus was omnipotent in rome        but grecian persius  after he    had been besprinkled plenteously    with gall italic  cries   by all    the gods above  on thee i call     oh brutus  thou of old renown     for putting kings completely down     to save us  wherefore do you not    despatch this king here on the spot     one of the tasks is this  believe     which you are destined to achieve       this is just such a squib as a young fellow might be expected to dash  off for the amusement of his brother officers  while the incident which  led to it was yet fresh in their minds  slight as it is  one feels sure  its preservation by so severe a critic of his own writings as horace was  due to some charm of association  or possibly to the fact that in it  he had made his first essay in satire  the defeat of brutus at philippi   b c      brought horace s military career to a close  even before this  decisive event  his dream of the re establishment of liberty and the  old roman constitution had probably begun to fade away  under his actual  experience of the true aims and motives of the mass of those whom brutus  and cassius had hitherto been leading to victory  and satiating with  plunder  young aristocrats  who sneered at the freedman s son  were  not likely to found any system of liberty worthy of the name  or to use  success for nobler purposes than those of selfish ambition  fighting  was not horace s vocation  and with the death of brutus and those  nobler spirits  who fell at philippi rather than survive their hopes  of freedom  his motive for fighting was at an end  to prolong a contest  which its leaders had surrendered in despair was hopeless  he did not   therefore  like pompeius varus and others of his friends  join the party  which  for a time  protracted the struggle under the younger pompey   but  like his great leader  he had fought for a principle  nor could  he have regarded otherwise than with horror the men who had overthrown  brutus  reeking as they were with the blood of a thousand proscriptions   and reckless as they had shown themselves of every civil right and  social obligation  as little  therefore  was he inclined to follow the  example of others of his distinguished friends and companions in arms   such as valerius messalla and aelius lamia  who not merely made their  peace with antony and octavius  but cemented it by taking service in  their army         chapter ii     returns to rome after battle of philippi   early poems       availing himself of the amnesty proclaimed by the conquerors  horace  found his way back to rome  his father was dead  how long before is not  known  if the little property at venusia had remained unsold  it was of  course confiscated  when the lands of men  like virgil  who had taken no  active part in the political conflicts of the day  were being seized to  satisfy the rapacity of a mercenary soldiery  horace s paternal acres  were not likely to escape  in rome he found himself penniless  how to  live was the question  and  fortunately for literature   chill penury   did not repress  but  on the contrary  stimulated his  noble rage         bated in spirit  and with pinions clipped     of all the means my father left me stripped     want stared me in the face  so then and there    i took to scribbling verse in sheer despair      despoiled of his means  and smarting with defeat  horace was just in the  state of mind to strike vigorously at men and manners which he did not  like  young  ardent  constitutionally hot in temper  eager to assert   amid the general chaos of morals public and private  the higher  principles of the philosophic schools from which he had so recently  come  irritated by the thousand mortifications to which a man of  cultivated tastes and keenly alive to beauty is exposed in a luxurious  city  where the prizes he values most are carried off  yet scarcely  valued  by the wealthy vulgar  he was especially open to the besetting  temptation of clever young men to write satire  and to write it in a  merciless spirit  as he says of himself  odes  i             in youth s pleasant spring time     the shafts of my passion at random i flung     and  dashing headlong into petulant rhyme     i recked neither where nor how fiercely i stung      youth is always intolerant  and it is so easy to be severe  so seductive  to say brilliant things  whether they be true or not  but there came a  day  and it came soon  when horace  saw that triumphs gained in this way  were of little value  and when he was anxious that his friends should  join with him in consigning his smart and scurril lines   celeres et  criminosos iambos   to oblivion  the  amende  for some early lampoon  which he makes in the ode just quoted  though ostensibly addressed to  a lady who had been its victim  was probably intended to cover a wider  field     personal satire is always popular  but the fame it begets is bought  dearly at the cost of lifelong enmities and many after regrets  that  horace in his early writings was personal and abusive is very clear   both from his own language and from a few of the poems of this class and  period which survive  some of these have no value  except as showing how  badly even horace could write  and how sedulously the better feeling  and better taste of his riper years led him to avoid that most worthless  form of satire which attacks where rejoinder is impossible  and  irritates the temper but cannot possibly amend the heart  in others  the  lash is applied with no less justice than vigour  as in the following  invective  the fourth of the epodes          such hate as nature meant to be     twixt lamb and wolf i feel for thee     whose hide by spanish scourge is tanned     and legs still bear the fetter s brand     though of your gold you strut so vain     wealth cannot change the knave in grain     how  see you not  when striding down    the via sacra    in your gown    good six ells wide  the passers there    turn on you with indignant stare      this wretch   such gibes your ear invade      by the triumvirs      scourges flayed     till even the crier shirked his toil     some thousand acres ploughs of soil    falernian  and with his nags    wears out the appian highway s flags     nay  on the foremost seats  despite    of otho  sits and apes the knight     what boots it to despatch a fleet    so large  so heavy  so complete     against a gang of rascal knaves     thieves  corsairs  buccaneers  and slaves     if villain of such vulgar breed    is in the foremost rank to lead             the sacred way  leading to the capitol  a favourite lounge           when a slave was being scourged  under the orders of the     triumviri capitales  a public crier stood by  and proclaimed the     nature of his crime     modern critics may differ as to whom this bitter infective was aimed at   but there could have been no doubt on that subject in rome at the time   and if  as there is every reason to conclude  it was levelled at sextus  menas  the lines  when first shown about among horace s friends  must  have told with great effect  and they were likely to be remembered long  after the infamous career of this double dyed traitor had come to a  close  menas was a freedman of pompey the great  and a trusted officer  of his son sextus   footnote  shakespeare has introduced him in  antony  and cleopatra   along with menecrates and varrius  as  friends to sextus  pompeius    he had recently  b c      carried over with him to augustus  a portion of pompey s fleet which was under his command  and betrayed  into his hands the islands of corsica and sardinia  for this act of  treachery he was loaded with wealth and honours  and when augustus   next year  fitted out a naval expedition against sextus pompeius   menas received a command  it was probably lucky for horace that this  swaggering upstart  who was not likely to be scrupulous as to his means  of revenge  went over the very next year to his former master  whom he  again abandoned within a year to sell himself once more to augustus   that astute politician put it out of his power to play further tricks  with the fleet  by giving him a command in pannonia  where he was  killed  b c      at the siege of siscia  the modern sissek     though horace was probably best known in rome in these early days as a  writer of lampoons and satirical poems  in which the bitterness of his  models archilochus and lucilius was aimed at  not very successfully  for  bitterness and personal rancour were not natural to the man  he showed  in other compositions signs of the true poetic spirit  which afterwards  found expression in the consummate grace and finish of his odes  to  this class belongs the following poem  epode      which  from internal  evidence  appears to have been written b c      when the state of italy   convulsed by civil war  was well calculated to fill him with despair   horace had frequent occasion between this period and the battle of  actium  when the defeat and death of antony closed the long struggle for  supremacy between him and octavius  to appeal to his countrymen against  the waste of the best blood of italy in civil fray  which might have  been better spent in subduing a foreign foe  and spreading the lustre  of the roman arms  but if we are to suppose this poem written when the  tidings of the bloody incidents of the perusian campaign had arrived in  rome   the reduction of the town of perusia by famine  and the massacre  of from two to three hundred prisoners  almost all of equestrian or  senatorial rank   we can well understand the feeling under which the  poem is written     to the roman people       another age in civil wars will soon be spent and worn     and by her native strength our rome be wrecked and overborne     that rome  the marsians could not crush  who border on our lands     nor the shock of threatening porsena with his etruscan bands     nor capua s strength that rivalled ours  nor spartacus the stern     nor the faithless allobrogian  who still for change doth yearn     ay  what gennania s blue eyed youth quelled not with ruthless sword     nor hannibal by our great sires detested and abhorred     we shall destroy with impious hands imbrued in brother s gore     and wild beasts of the wood shall range our native land once more     a foreign foe  alas  shall tread the city s ashes down     and his horse s ringing hoofs shall smite her places of renown     and the bones of great quirinus  now religiously enshrined     shall be flung by sacrilegious hands to the sunshine and the wind     and if ye all from ills so dire ask how yourselves to free     or such at least as would not hold your lives unworthily     no better counsel can i urge  than that which erst inspired    the stout phocaeans when from their doomed city they retired     their fields  their household gods  their shrines surrendering as a    prey    to the wild boar and the ravening wolf      so we  in our dismay     where er our wandering steps may chance to carry us should go     or wheresoe er across the seas the fitful winds may blow     how think ye then  if better course none offer  why should we    not seize the happy auspices  and boldly put to sea     but let us swear this oath    whene er  if e er shall come the time     rocks upwards from the deep shall float  return shall not be crime     nor we be loath to back our sails  the ports of home to seek     when the waters of the po shall lave matinum s rifted peak     or skyey apenninus down into the sea be rolled     or wild unnatural desires such monstrous revel hold     that in the stag s endearments the tigress shall delight     and the turtle dove adulterate with the falcon and the kite     that unsuspicious herds no more shall tawny lions fear     and the he goat  smoothly sleek of skin  through the briny deep    career      this having sworn  and what beside may our returning stay     straight let us all  this city s doomed inhabitants  away     or those that rise above the herd  the few of nobler soul     the craven and the hopeless here on their ill starred beds may loll     ye who can feel and act like men  this woman s wail give o er     and fly to regions far away beyond the etruscan shore     the circling ocean waits us  then away  where nature smiles     to those fair lands  those blissful lands  the rich and happy isles     where ceres year by year crowns all the untilled land with sheaves     and the vine with purple clusters droops  unpruned of all her    leaves     where the olive buds and burgeons  to its promise ne er untrue     and the russet fig adorns the tree  that graffshoot never knew     where honey from the hollow oaks doth ooze  and crystal rills    come dancing down with tinkling feet from the sky dividing hills     there to the pails the she goats come  without a master s word     and home with udders brimming broad returns the friendly herd     there round the fold no surly bear its midnight prowl doth make     nor teems the rank and heaving soil with the adder and the snake     there no contagion smites the flocks  nor blight of any star    with fury of remorseless heat the sweltering herds doth mar     nor this the only bliss that waits us there  where drenching rains    by watery eurus swept along ne er devastate the plains     nor are the swelling seeds burnt up within the thirsty clods     so kindly blends the seasons there the king of all the gods     that shore the argonautic bark s stout rowers never gained     nor the wily she of colchis with step unchaste profaned     the sails of sidon s galleys ne er were wafted to that strand     nor ever rested on its slopes ulysses  toilworn band     for jupiter  when he with brass the golden age alloyed     that blissful region set apart by the good to be enjoyed     with brass and then with iron he the ages seared  but ye     good men and true  to that bright home arise and follow me           the story of the phocaeans is told by herodotus  ch        when     their city was attacked by harpagus  they retired in a body to make     way for the persians  who took possession of it  they subsequently     returned  and put to the sword the persian garrison which had been     left in it by harpagus   afterwards  when this was accomplished      they pronounced terrible imprecations on any who should desert the     fleet  besides this  they sunk a mass of molten iron  and swore     that they would never return to phocaea until it should appear     again      this poem  lord lytton has truly said   has the character of youth in  its defects and its beauties  the redundance of its descriptive passages  is in marked contrast to the terseness of description which horace  studies in his odes  and there is something declamatory in its general  tone which is at variance with the simpler utterance of lyrical art  on  the other hand  it has all the warmth of genuine passion  and in sheer  vigour of composition horace has rarely excelled it      the idea of the happy isles  referred to in the poem  was a familiar one  with the greek poets  they became in time confounded with the elysian  fields  in which the spirits of the departed good and great enjoyed  perpetual rest  it is as such that ulysses mentions them in tennyson s  noble monologue          it may be that the gulfs shall wash us down     it may be we shall reach the happy isles     and see the great achilles  whom we knew      these islands were supposed to be in the far west  and were probably the  poetical amplification of some voyager s account of the canaries or  of madeira  there has always been a region beyond the boundaries of  civilisation to which the poet s fancy has turned for ideal happiness  and peace  the difference between ancient and modern is  that material  comforts  as in this epode  enter largely into the dream of the ancient   while independence  beauty  and grandeur are the chief elements in the  modern picture          larger constellations burning  mellow moons and happy skies     breadth of tropic shade and palms in cluster  knots of paradise     never comes the trader  never floats an european flag     slides the bird o er lustrous woodland  droops the trailer from the  crag   droops the heavy blossomed bower  hangs the heavy fruited tree     summer isles of eden lying in dark purple spheres of sea      to the same class of horace s early poems  though probably a few years  later in date  belongs the following eulogium of a country life and its  innocent enjoyments  epode     the leading idea of which was embodied by  pope in the familiar lines  wonderful for finish as the production of a  boy of eleven  beginning       happy the man whose wish and care    a few paternal acres bound      with characteristic irony horace puts his fancies into the mouth of  alphius  a miserly money lender  no one yearns so keenly for the country  and its imagined peace as the overworked city man  when his pulse is low  and his spirits weary with bad air and the reaction of over excitement   no one  as a rule  is more apt to tire of the homely and uneventful  life which the country offers  or to find that  for him at least  its  quietude does not bring peace  it is not  therefore  at all out of  keeping  although critics have taken exception to the poem on this  ground  that horace makes alphius rhapsodise on the charms of a rural  life  and having tried them  creep back within the year to his moneybags  and his ten per cent  it was  besides  a favourite doctrine with him   which he is constantly enforcing in his later works  that everybody  envies his neighbour s pursuits  until he tries them     alphius       happy the man  in busy schemes unskilled       who  living simply  like our sires of old     tills the few acres  which his father tilled       vexed by no thoughts of usury or gold       the shrilling clarion ne er his slumber mars       nor quails he at the howl of angry seas     he shuns the forum  with its wordy jars       nor at a great man s door consents to freeze       the tender vine shoots  budding into life       he with the stately poplar tree doth wed     lopping the fruitless branches with his knife       and grafting shoots of promise in their stead       or in some valley  up among the hills       watches his wandering herds of lowing kine     or fragrant jars with liquid honey fills       or shears his silly sheep in sunny shine       or when autumnus o er the smiling land      lifts up his head with rosy apples crowned     joyful he plucks the pears  which erst his hand      graffed on the stem they re weighing to the ground       plucks grapes in noble clusters purple dyed       a gift for thee  priapus  and for thee     father sylvanus  where thou dost preside       warding his bounds beneath thy sacred tree       now he may stretch his careless limbs to rest       where some old ilex spreads its sacred roof     now in the sunshine lie  as likes him best       on grassy turf of close elastic woof       and streams the while glide on with murmurs low       and birds are singing  mong the thickets deep     and fountains babble  sparkling as they flow       and with their noise invite to gentle sleep       but when grim winter comes  and o er his grounds      scatters its biting snows with angry roar     he takes the field  and with a cry of hounds      hunts down into the toils the foaming boar       or seeks the thrush  poor starveling  to ensnare       in filmy net with bait delusive stored     entraps the travelled crane  and timorous hare       rare dainties these to glad his frugal board       who amid joys like these would not forget      the pangs which love to all its victims bears     the fever of the brain  the ceaseless fret       and all the heart s lamentings and despairs       but if a chaste and blooming wife  beside       the cheerful home with sweet young blossoms fills     like some stout sabine  or the sunburnt bride      of the lithe peasant of the apulian hills       who piles the hearth with logs well dried and old      against the coming of her wearied lord     and  when at eve the cattle seek the fold       drains their full udders of the milky hoard       and bringing forth from her well tended store      a jar of wine  the vintage of the year     spreads an unpurchased feast   oh then  not more      could choicest lucrine oysters give me cheer       or the rich turbot  or the dainty char       if ever to our bays the winter s blast    should drive them in its fury from afar       nor were to me a welcomer repast      the afric hen or the ionic snipe       than olives newly gathered from the tree     that hangs abroad its clusters rich and ripe       or sorrel  that doth love the pleasant lea       or mallows wholesome for the body s need       or lamb foredoomed upon some festal day    in offering to the guardian gods to bleed       or kidling which the wolf hath marked for prey       what joy  amidst such feasts  to see the sheep       full of the pasture  hurrying homewards come     to see the wearied oxen  as they creep       dragging the upturned ploughshare slowly home       or  ranged around the bright and blazing hearth       to see the hinds  a house s surest wealth     beguile the evening with their simple mirth       and all the cheerfulness of rosy health       thus spake the miser alphius  and  bent      upon a country life  called in amain    the money he at usury had lent         but ere the month was out   twas lent again     in this charming sketch of the peasant s life it is easy to see that  horace is drawing from nature  like burns in his more elaborate picture  of the  cottar s saturday night   horace had obviously watched closely  the ways of the peasantry round his apulian home  as he did at a later  date those of the sabine country  and to this we owe many of the most  delightful passages in his works  he omits no opportunity of contrasting  their purity of morals  and the austere self denial of their life  with  the luxurious habits and reckless vice of the city life of rome  thus   in one of the finest of his odes  book iii      after painting with a  few masterly strokes what the matrons and the fast young ladies of the  imperial city had become  it was not from such as these  he continues   that the noble youth sprang  who dyed the seas with carthaginian gore   overthrew pyrrhus and great antiochus and direful hannibal   concluding  in words which contrast by their suggestive terseness at the same time  that they suggest comparison with the elaborated fulness of the epode  just quoted          but they  of rustic warriors wight    the manly offspring  learned to smite      the soil with sabine spade     and faggots they had cut  to bear    home from the forest  whensoe er      an austere mother bade        what time the sun began to change    the shadows through the mountain range       and took the yoke away    from the o erwearied oxen  and    his parting car proclaimed at hand      the kindliest hour of day      another of horace s juvenile poems  unique in subject and in treatment   epode     gives evidence of a picturesque power of the highest kind   stimulating the imagination  and swaying it with the feelings of pity  and terror in a way to make us regret that he wrote no others in a  similar vein  we find ourselves at midnight in the gardens of the  sorceress canidia  whither a boy of good family  his rank being clearly  indicated by the reference to his purple  toga  and  bulla   has been  carried off from his home  his terrified exclamations  with which the  poem opens  as canidia and her three assistants surround him  glaring  on him  with looks significant of their deadly purpose  through lurid  flames fed with the usual ghastly ingredients of a witch s fire   carry us at once into the horrors of the scene  while one of the hags  sprinkles her hell drops through the adjoining house  another is casting  up earth from a pit  in which the boy is presently imbedded to the chin   and killed by a frightful process of slow torture  in order that a  love philtre of irresistible power may be concocted from his liver  and spleen  the time  the place  the actors are brought before us with  singular dramatic power  canidia s burst of wonder and rage that the  spells she deemed all powerful have been counteracted by some sorceress  of skill superior to her own  gives great reality to the scene  and the  curses of the dying boy  launched with tragic vigour  and closing with a  touch of beautiful pathos  bring it to an effective close     the speculations as to who and what canidia was  in which scholars  have run riot  are conspicuous for absurdity  even among the wild and  ridiculous conjectures as to the personages named by horace in which the  commentators have indulged  that some well known person was the original  of canidia is extremely probable  for professors of witchcraft abounded  at the time  combining very frequently  like their modern successors   the arts of medea with the attributes of dame quickly  what more  natural than for a young poet to work up an effective picture out of  the abundant suggestions which the current stories of such creatures and  their doings presented to his hand  the popular belief in their power   the picturesque conditions under which their spells were wrought  the  wild passions in which lay the secret of their hold upon the credulity  of their victims  offered to the roman poet  just as they did to our own  elizabethan dramatists  a combination of materials most favourable for  poetic treatment  but that horace had  as many of his critics contend   a feeling of personal vanity  the pique of a discarded lover  to avenge   is an assumption wholly without warrant  he was the last man  at any  time or under any circumstances  to have had any relations of a personal  nature with a woman of canidia s class  however inclined he may have  been to use her and her practices for poetic purposes  he manifestly not  only saw through the absurdity of her pretensions  but laughed at her  miserable impotence  and meant that others should do the same  it seems  to be impossible to read the  th of his first book of his satires  and  not come to this conclusion  that satire consists of the monologue of a  garden god  set up in the garden which maecenas had begun to lay out on  the esquiline hill  this spot had until recently been the burial ground  of the roman poor  a quarter noisome by day  and the haunt of thieves  and beasts of prey by night  on this obscene spot  littered with skulls  and dead men s bones  canidia and her accomplice sagana are again  introduced  digging a pit with their nails  into which they pour the  blood of a coal black ewe  which they had previously torn limb meal        so to evoke the shade and soul    of dead men  and from these to wring    responses to their questioning      they have with them two effigies  one of wax and the other of wool  the  latter the larger of the two  and overbearing the other  which cowers  before it                     like one that stands    beseeching in the hangman s hands     on hecate one  tisiphone    the other calls  and you might see    serpents and hell hounds thread the dark     whilst  these vile orgies not to mark     the moon  all bloody red of hue     behind the massive tombs withdrew      the hags pursue their incantations  higher and higher flames their  ghastly fire  and the grizzled wolves and spotted snakes slink in terror  to their holes  as the shrieks and muttered spells of the beldams make  the moon forsaken night more hideous  but after piling up his horrors  with the most elaborate skill  as if in the view of some terrible  climax  the poet makes them collapse into utter farce  disgusted  by their intrusion on his privacy  the priapus adopts a simple but  exceedingly vulgar expedient to alarm these appalling hags  in  an instant they fall into the most abject terror  suspend their  incantations  and  tucking up their skirts  make off for the more  comfortable quarters of the city as fast as their trembling limbs can  carry them  canidia  the great enchantress  dropping her false teeth   and her attendant sagana parting company with her wig  by the way                                     while you    with laughter long and loud might view    their herbs  and charmed adders wound    in mystic coils  bestrew the ground      and yet grave scholars gravely ask us to believe that canidia was an old  mistress of the poet s  these poems evidently made a success  and horace  returned to the theme in his   th epode  here he writes as though he had  been put under a spell by canidia  in revenge for his former calumnies  about her        my youth has fled  my rosy hue    turned to a wan and livid blue     blanched by thy mixtures is my hair     no respite have i from despair     the days and nights  they wax and wane     yet bring me no release from pain     nor can i ease  howe er i gasp     the spasm  which holds me in its grasp      here we have all the well known symptoms of a man under a malign magical  influence  in this extremity horace affects to recant all the mischief  he has formerly spoken of the enchantress  let her name what penance he  will  he is ready to perform it  if a hundred steers will appease her  wrath  they are hers  or if she prefers to be sung of as the chaste and  good  and to range above the spheres as a golden star  his lyre is at  her service  her parentage is as unexceptionable as her life is pure   but while ostentatiously disclaiming his libels  the poet takes care to  insinuate them anew  by apostrophising her in conclusion  thus          thou who dost ne er in haglike wont    among the tombs of paupers hunt    for ashes newly laid in ground     love charms and philtres to compound     thy heart is gentle  pure thy hands      of course  canidia is not mollified by such a recantation as this  the  man who        branding her name with ill renown     made her the talk of all the town      is not so lightly to be forgiven        you d have a speedy doom  but no     it shall be lingering  sharp  and slow      the pangs of tantalus  of prometheus  or of sisyphus are but the types  of what his shall be  let him try to hang  drown  stab himself  his  efforts will be vain          then comes my hour of triumph  then    i ll goad you till you writhe again     then shall you curse the evil hour    you made a mockery of my power      she then triumphantly reasserts the powers to which she lays claim   what  i  she exclaims  who can waste life as the waxen image of my  victim melts before my magic fire  footnote  thus hecate in middleton s   witch  assures to the duchess of glo ster  a sudden and subtle death   to her victim      i  who can bring down the moon from her sphere  evoke  the dead from their ashes  and turn the affections by my philtres          shall i my potent art bemoan    as impotent  gainst thee alone      surely all this is as purely the work of imagination as middleton s   witch   or the hags in  macbeth   or in goethe s  faust   horace used  canidia as a byword for all that was hateful in the creatures of her  craft  filthy as they were in their lives and odious in their persons   his literary and other friends were as familiar with her name in this  sense as we are with those of squeers and micawber  as types of a class   and the joke was well understood when  many years after  in the  th of  his second book of satires  he said that nasidienus s dinner party  broke up without their eating a morsel of the dishes after a certain  point    as if a pestilential blast from canidia s throat  more venomous  than that of african vipers  had swept across them         his picture made in wax  and gently molten    by a blue fire  kindled with dead men s eyes     will waste him by degrees        an old delusion  we find it in theocritus  where a girl  forsaken by her  lover  resorts to the same desperate restorative  idylls ii              as this image of wax i melt here by aidance demonic     myndian delphis shall so melt with love s passion anon      again ovid  heroides vi      makes hypsipyle say of medea        the absent she binds with her spells  and figures of wax she  devises   and in their agonised spleen fine pointed needles she thrusts          chapter iii     introduction to maecenas   the journey to brundusium       horace had not been long in rome  after his return from greece  before  he had made himself a name  with what he got from the booksellers  or  possibly by the help of friends  he had purchased a patent place in the  quaestor s department  a sort of clerkship of the treasury  which he  continued to hold for many years  if not indeed to the close of his  life  the duties were light  but they demanded  and at all events had   his occasional attention  even after he was otherwise provided for   being his own  bought by his own money  it may have gratified his love  of independence to feel that  if the worst came to the worst  he had his  official salary to fall back upon  among his friends  men of letters are  at this time  as might have been expected  found to be most conspicuous   virgil  who had recently been despoiled  like  himself  of his  paternal property  took occasion to bring his name before maecenas  the  confidential adviser and minister of octavius  in whom he had himself  found a helpful friend  this was followed up by the commendation of  varius  already celebrated as a writer of epic poetry  and whose tragedy  of  thyestes   if we are to trust quintilian  was not unworthy to rank  with the best tragedies of greece  maecenas may not at first have been  too well disposed towards a follower of the republican party  who  had not been sparing of his satire against many of the supporters and  favourites of octavius  he sent for horace  however  b c       and any  prejudice on this score  if prejudice there was  was ultimately got  over  maecenas took time to form his estimate of the man  and it was  not till nine months after their first interview that he sent for horace  again  when he did so  however  it was to ask him to consider himself  for the future among the number of his friends  this part of horace s  story is told with admirable brevity and good feeling in the satire from  which we have already quoted  addressed to maecenas  b  i  sat     a few  years afterwards        lucky i will not call myself  as though    thy friendship i to mere good fortune owe     no chance it was secured me thy regards     but virgil first  that best of men and bards     and then kind varius mentioned what i was     before you brought  with many a faltering pause     dropping some few brief words  for bashfulness    robbed me of utterance  i did not profess    that i was sprung of lineage old and great     or used to canter round my own estate    on satureian barb  but what and who    i was as plainly told  as usual  you    brief answer make me  i retire  and then     some nine months after  summoning me again     you bid me  mongst your friends assume a place     and proud i feel that thus i won your grace     not by an ancestry long known to fame     but by my life  and heart devoid of blame      the name of maecenas is from this time inseparably associated with that  of horace  from what little is authentically known of him  this much may  be gathered  he was a man of great general accomplishment  well versed  in the literature both of greece and rome  devoted to literature and  the society of men of letters  a lover of the fine arts and of natural  history  a connoisseur of gems and precious stones  fond of living in  a grand style  and of surrounding himself with people who amused him   without being always very particular as to who or what they were  for  the indulgence of all these tastes  his great wealth was more than  sufficient  he reclaimed the esquiline hill from being the public  nuisance we have already described  laid it out in gardens  and in the  midst of these built himself a sumptuous palace  where the church of  santa maria maggiore now stands  from which he commanded a superb view  of the country looking towards tivoli  to this palace  salubrious from  its spacious size and the elevation of its site  augustus  when ill   had himself carried from his own modest mansion  and from its lofty  belvedere tower nero is said to have enjoyed the spectacle of rome in  flames beneath him  voluptuary and dilettante as maecenas was  he was  nevertheless  like most men of a sombre and melancholy temperament   capable of great exertions  and he veiled under a cold exterior and  reserved manners a habit of acute observation  a kind heart  and   in matters of public concern  a resolute will  this latent energy of  character  supported as it was by a subtle knowledge of mankind and a  statesmanlike breadth of view  contributed in no small degree to  the ultimate triumph of octavius caesar over his rivals  and to the  successful establishment of the empire in his hands  when the news of  julius caesar s assassination reached the young octavius  then only  nineteen  in apollonia  it has been said that maecenas was in attendance  upon him as his governor or tutor  be this so or not  as soon as  octavius appears in the political arena as his uncle s avenger  maecenas  is found by his side  in several most important negotiations he acted  as his representative  thus  b c       the year before horace was  introduced to him  he  along with cocceius nerva  negotiated with antony  the peace of brundusium  which resulted in antony s ill starred marriage  with caesar s sister octavia  two years later he was again associated  with cocceius in a similar task  on which occasion horace and virgil  accompanied him to brundusium  he appears to have commanded in various  expeditions  both naval and military  but it was at rome and in council  that his services were chiefly sought  and he acted as one of the chief  advisers of augustus down to about five years before his death  when   either from ill health or some other unknown cause  he abandoned  political life  more than once he was charged by augustus with the  administration of the civil affairs of italy during his own absence   intrusted with his seal  and empowered to open all his letters addressed  to the senate  and  if necessary  to alter their contents  so as to  adapt them to the condition of affairs at home  his aim  like that of  vipsanius agrippa  who was in himself the nelson and wellington of the  age  seems to have been to build up a united and flourishing empire in  the person of augustus  whether from temperament or policy  or both   he set his face against the system of cruelty and extermination which  disgraced the triumvirate  when octavius was one day condemning man  after man to death  maecenas  after a vain attempt to reach him on  the tribunal  where he sat surrounded by a dense crowd  wrote upon his  tablets   surge tandem  carnifex     butcher  break off   and flung  them across the crowd into the lap of caesar  who felt the rebuke   and immediately quitted the judgment seat  his policy was that of  conciliation  and while bent on the establishment of a monarchy  from  what we must fairly assume to have been a patriotic conviction that  this form of government could alone meet the exigencies of the time  he  endeavoured to combine this with a due regard to individual liberty  and  a free expression of individual opinion     at the time of horace s introduction to him  maecenas was probably  at his best  in the full vigour of his intellect  and alive with the  generous emotions which must have animated a man bent as he was on  securing tranquillity for the state  and healing the strife of factions   which were threatening it with ruin  his chief relaxation from the  fatigues of public life was  to all appearance  found in the society of  men of letters  and  judging by what horace says  satires  i       the  vie intime  of his social circle must have been charming  to  be admitted within it was a privilege eagerly coveted  and with good  reason  for not only was this in itself a stamp of distinction  but his  parties were well known as the pleasantest in rome          no house more free from all that s base     in none cabals more out of place     it hurts me not  if others be    more rich  or better read than me     each has his place      like many of his contemporaries  who were eminent in political life   maecenas devoted himself to active literary work  for he wrote much   and on a variety of topics  his taste in literature was  however  better  than his execution  his style was diffuse  affected  and obscure  but  seneca  who tells us this  and gives some examples which justify the  criticism  tells us at the same time that his genius was massive and  masculine   grande et virile    and that he would have been eminent for  eloquence  if fortune had not spoiled him  however vicious his own style  may have been  the man who encouraged three such writers as virgil   propertius  and horace  not to mention others of great repute  whose  works have perished  was clearly a sound judge of a good style in  others     as years went on  and the cares of public life grew less onerous  habits  of self indulgence appear to have grown upon maecenas  it will probably  be well  however  to accept with some reserve what has been said against  him on this head  then  as now  men of rank and power were the victims  of calumnious gossips and slanderous pamphleteers  his health became  precarious  incessant sleeplessness spoke of an overtasked brain and  shattered nerves  life was full of pain  still he clung to it with a  craven like tenacity  so  at least  seneca asserts  quoting in support  of his statement some very bad verses by maecenas  which may be thus  translated          lame in feet  and lame in fingers       crooked in back  with every tooth      rattling in my head  yet   sooth     i m content  so life but lingers     gnaw my withers  rack my bones     life  mere life  for all atones      in one view these lines may certainly be construed to import the  same sentiment as the speech of the miserable claudio in  measure for  measure           the weariest and most loathed worldly life    that age  ache  penury  and imprisonment    can lay on nature  is a paradise    to what we fear of death      but  on the other hand  they may quite as fairly be regarded as merely  giving expression to the tenet of the epicurean philosophy  that however  much we may suffer from physical pain or inconvenience  it is still  possible to be happy   we know what we are  we know not what we may be      not the least misfortune of maecenas was his marriage to a woman whom  he could neither live with nor without  separating from and returning  to her so often  that  according to seneca  he was a thousand times  married  yet never had but one wife  friends he had many  loyal and  devoted friends  on whose society and sympathy he leant more and more  as the years wore on  he rarely stirred from rome  loving its smoke   its thronged and noisy streets  its whirl of human passions  as johnson  loved fleet street  or  the sweet shady side of pall mall   better than  all the verdure of tivoli  or the soft airs and exquisite scenery of  baiae  he liked to read of these things  however  and may have found as  keen a pleasure in the scenery of the  georgics   or in horace s little  landscape pictures  as most men could have extracted from the scenes  which they describe     such was the man  ushered into whose presence  horace  the reckless  lampooner and satirist  found himself embarrassed  and at a loss for  words  horace was not of the macsycophant class  who cannot  keep their  back straight in the presence of a great man   nor do we think he had  much of the nervous apprehensiveness of the poetic temperament  why   then  should he have felt thus abashed  partly  it may have been  from  natural diffidence at encountering a man to gain whose goodwill was  a matter of no small importance  but whose goodwill  he also knew by  report  was not easily won  and partly  to find himself face to face  with one so conspicuously identified with the cause against which he had  fought  and the men whom he had hitherto had every reason to detest     once admitted by maecenas to the inner circle of his friends  horace  made his way there rapidly  thus we find him  a few months afterwards   in the spring of b c      going to brundusium with maecenas  who  had been despatched thither on a mission of great public importance   satires  i      the first term of the triumvirate of antony  octavius   and lepidus had expired at the close of the previous year  no fresh  arrangement had been made  and antony  alarmed at the growing power of  octavius in italy  had appeared off brundusium with a fleet of     sail  and a strong body of troops  the brundusians  on a hint  probably  from  octavius  forbade his landing  and he had to go on to tarentum  where  terms were ultimately arranged for a renewal of the triumvirate  the  moment was a critical one  for an open rupture between octavius and  antony was imminent  which might well have proved disastrous to the  former  had antony joined his fleet to that of the younger pompey   which  without his aid  had already proved more than a match for the  naval force of octavius     to judge by horace s narrative  all the friends who accompanied maecenas  on this occasion  except his coadjutor  cocceius nerva  who had three  years before been engaged with him on a similar mission to brundusium   were men whose thoughts were given more to literature than to politics   horace starts from rome with heliodorus  a celebrated rhetorician  and  they make their way very leisurely to anxur  terracina   where they are  overtaken by maecenas         twas fixed that we should meet with dear    maecenas and cocceius here     who were upon a mission bound     of consequence the most profound     for who so skilled the feuds to close    of those  once friends  who now were foes      this is the only allusion throughout the poem  to the object of the  journey  the previous day  horace had been baulked of his dinner  the  water being so bad  and his stomach so delicate  that he chose to fast  rather than run the risk of making himself ill with it  and now at  terracina he found his eyes  which were weak  so troublesome  that he  had to dose them well with a black wash  these are the first indications  we get of habitual delicacy of health  which  if not due altogether to  the fatigues and exposure of his campaign with brutus  had probably been  increased by them          meanwhile beloved maecenas came       cocceius too  and brought with them      fonteius capito  a man      endowed with every grace that can      a perfect gentleman attend       and antony s especial friend      they push on next day to formiae  and are amused at fundi  fondi  on the  way by the consequential airs of the prefect of the place  it would  seem as if the peacock nature must break out the moment a man becomes a  prefect or a mayor        there having rested for the night     with inexpressible delight    we hail the dawn   for we that day    at sinuessa  on our way    with plotius      virgil  varius too     have an appointed rendezvous     souls all  than whom the earth ne er saw    more noble  more exempt from flaw     nor are there any on its round    to whom i am more firmly bound     oh  what embracings  and what mirth     nothing  no  nothing  on this earth     whilst i have reason  shall i

where  so soon as their mules are unpacked   away       maecenas hies  at ball to play     to sleep myself and virgil go     for tennis practice is  we know     injurious  quite beyond all question     both to weak eyes and weak digestion      with these and suchlike details horace carries us pleasantly on with  his party to brundusium  they were manifestly in no hurry  for they took  fourteen days  according to gibbon s careful estimate  to travel      roman miles  that they might have got over the ground much faster   if necessary  is certain from what is known of other journeys  caesar  posted     miles a day  tiberius travelled     miles in twenty four  hours  when he was hastening to close the eyes of his brother drusus   and statius  sylv      carm     talks of a man leaving rome in the  morning  and being at baiae or puteoli      miles off  before night        have but the will  be sure you ll find the way     what shall stop him  who starts at break of day    from sleeping rome  and on the lucrine sails    before the sunshine into twilight pales      just as  according to sydney smith  in his famous allusion to the  triumphs of railway travelling   the early scotchman scratches himself  in the morning mists of the north  and has his porridge in piccadilly  before the setting sun      horace treats the expedition to brundusium entirely as if it had been a  pleasant tour  gibbon thinks he may have done so purposely  to convince  those who were jealous of his intimacy with the great statesman   that  his thoughts and occupations on the event were far from being of a  serious or political nature   but it was a rule with horace  in all his  writings  never to indicate  by the slightest word  that he knew any  of the political secrets which  as the intimate friend of maecenas  he  could scarcely have failed to know  he hated babbling of all kinds   a man who reported the private talk of friends  even on comparatively  indifferent topics          the churl  who out of doors will spread    what  mongst familiar friends is said         epistle i  v       was his especial aversion  and he has more than once  said  only not in such formal phrase  what milton puts into the mouth of  his  samson agonistes                                   to have revealed    secrets of men  the secrets of a friend     how heinous had the fact been  how deserving    contempt  and scorn of all  to be excluded    all friendship  and avoided as a blab     the mark of fool set on his front      moreover  reticence  the indispensable quality  not of statesmen merely   but of their intimates  was not so rare a virtue in these days as in our  own  and as none would have expected horace  in a poem of this kind   to make any political confidences  he can scarcely be supposed to have  written it with any view to throwing the gossips of rome off the scent   the excursion had been a pleasant one  and he thought its incidents  worth noting  hence the poem  happily for us  who get from it most  interesting glimpses of some of the familiar aspects of roman life and  manners  of which we should otherwise have known nothing  here  for  example  is a sketch of how people fared in travelling by canal in those  days  near rome  overcrowding  we see  is not an evil peculiar to our  own days        now  gan the night with gentle hand    to fold in shadows all the land     and stars along the sky to scatter     when there arose a hideous clatter     slaves slanging bargemen  bargemen slaves      ho  haul up here  how now  ye knaves     inside three hundred people stuff     already there are quite enough      collected were the fares at last     the mule that drew our barge made fast     but not till a good hour was gone     sleep was not to be thought upon     the cursed gnats were so provoking     the bull frogs set up such a croaking     a bargeman  too  a drunken lout     and passenger  sang turn about     in tones remarkable for strength     their absent sweethearts  till at length    the passenger began to doze     when up the stalwart bargeman rose     his fastenings from the stone unwound     and left the mule to graze around     then down upon his back he lay     and snored in a terrific way      neither is the following allusion to the jews and their creed without  its value  especially when followed  as it is  by horace s avowal   almost in the words of lucretius  b  vi       of what was then his  own  later in life he came to a very different conclusion  when the  travellers reach egnatia  their ridicule is excited by being shown or  told  it is not very clear which  of incense kindled in the temple there  miraculously without the application of fire        this may your circumcised jew    believe  but never i  for true    i hold it that the deities    enjoy themselves in careless ease        nor think  when nature  spurning law     does something which inspires our awe      tis sent by the offended gods    direct from their august abodes            so tennyson  in his  lotus eaters              let us swear an oath  and keep it with an equal mind        in the hollow lotus land to live and lie reclined       on the hills like gods together  careless of mankind         see the whole of the passage     had horace known anything of natural science  he might not have gone so  far to seek for the explanation of the seeming miracle     gibbon speaks contemptuously of many of the incidents recorded in this  poem  asking   how could a man of taste reflect on them the day after    but the poem has much more than a merely literary interest  thanks to  such passages as these  and to the charming tribute by horace to his  friends previously cited     nothing can better illustrate the footing of easy friendship on which  he soon came to stand with maecenas than the following poem  which must  have been written before the year b c      for in that year terentia  became the mistress of the great palace on the esquiline  and the  allusion in the last verse is much too familiar to have been intended  for her  horace  whose delicacy of stomach was probably notorious  had  apparently been the victim of a practical joke  a species of rough  fun to which the romans of the upper classes appear to have been  particularly prone  it is difficult otherwise to understand how he could  have stumbled at maecenas s table on a dish so overdosed with garlic  as that which provoked this humorous protest  from what we know of the  abominations of an ordinary roman banquet  the vegetable stew in this  instance must have reached a climax of unusual atrocity        if his old father s throat any impious sinner      has cut with unnatural hand to the bone     give him garlic  more noxious than hemlock  at dinner       ye gods  the strong stomachs that reapers must own        with what poison is this that my vitals are heated       by viper s blood  certes  it cannot be less      stewed into the potherbs  can i have been

 with her hand that your mistress arrest all your kisses       and lie as far off as the couch will allow      it is startling to our notions to find so direct a reference as that in  the last verse to the  reigning favourite  of maecenas  but what are we  to think of the following lines  which point unequivocally to maecenas s  wife  in the following ode addressed to her husband  odes  ii             would you  friend  for phrygia s hoarded gold       or all that achaemenes  self possesses     or e en for what araby s coffers hold       barter one lock of her clustering tresses       while she stoops her throat to your burning kiss       or  fondly cruel  the bliss denies you     she would have you snatch  or will  snatching this      herself  with a sweeter thrill surprise you      if maecenas allowed his friends to write of his wife in this strain   it is scarcely to be wondered at if that coquettish and capricious lady  gave  as she did   that worthy man good grounds for uneasiness          chapter iv     publication of first book of satires   his friends   receives the sabine  farm from maecenas       in b c      horace published the first book of his satires  and placed  in front of it one specially addressed to maecenas  a course which he  adopted in each successive section of his poems  apparently to mark his  sense of obligation to him as the most honoured of his friends  the name   satires  does not truly indicate the nature of this series  they are  rather didactic poems  couched in a more or less dramatic form  and  carried on in an easy conversational tone  without for the most part any  definite purpose  often diverging into such collateral topics as suggest  themselves by the way  with all the ease and buoyancy of agreeable talk   and getting back or not  as it may happen  into the main line of idea  with which they set out  some of them are conceived in a vein of fine  irony throughout  others  like  the journey to brundusium   are mere  narratives  relieved by humorous illustrations  but we do not find  in them the epigrammatic force  the sternness of moral rebuke  or the  scathing spirit of sarcasm  which are commonly associated with the idea  of satire  literary display appears never to be aimed at  the plainest  phrases  the homeliest illustrations  the most everyday topics  if  they come in the way  are made use of for the purpose of insinuating  or enforcing some useful truth  point and epigram are the last things  thought of  and therefore it is that pope s translations  admirable as  in themselves they are  fail to give an idea of the lightness of touch   the shifting lights and shades  the carelessness alternating with force   the artless natural manner  which distinguish these charming essays    the terseness of horace s language in his satires   it has been well  said   is that of a proverb  neat because homely  while the terseness  of pope is that of an epigram  which will only become homely in time   because it is neat      in writing these satires  which he calls merely rhythmical prose  horace  disclaims for himself the title of poet  and at this time it would  appear as if he had not even conceived the idea of  modulating aeolic  song to the italian lyre   on which he subsequently rested his hopes  of posthumous fame  the very words of his disclaimer  however  show how  well he appreciated the poet s gifts  satires  i              first from the roll i strike myself of those i poets call     for merely to compose in verse is not the all in all     nor if a man shall write  like me  things nigh to prose akin     shall he  however well he write  the name of poet win     to genius  to the man whose soul is touched with fire divine     whose voice speaks like a trumpet note  that honoured name assign                  tis not enough that you compose your verse    in diction irreproachable  pure  scholarly  and terse     which  dislocate its cadence  by anybody may    be spoken like the language of the father in the play     divest those things which now i write  and lucilius wrote of yore     of certain measured cadences  by setting that before    which was behind  and that before which i had placed behind     yet by no alchemy will you in the residuum find    the members still apparent of the dislocated bard        a result which he contends would not ensue  however much you might  disarrange the language of a passage of true poetry  such as one he  quotes from ennius  the poetic charm of which  by the way  is not very  apparent  schooled  however  as he had been  in the pure literature of  greece  horace aimed at a conciseness and purity of style which had been  hitherto unknown in roman satire  and studied  not unsuccessfully  to  give to his own work  by great and well disguised elaboration of  finish  the concentrated force and picturesque precision which are large  elements in all genuine poetry  his own practice  as we see from its  results  is given in the following lines  and a better description  of how didactic or satiric poetry should be written could scarcely be  desired  satires  i              tis not enough  a poet s fame to make     that you with bursts of mirth your audience shake     and yet to this  as all experience shows     no small amount of skill and talent goes     your style must he concise  that what you say    may flow on clear and smooth  nor lose its way     stumbling and halting through a chaos drear    of cumbrous words  that load the weary ear     and you must pass from grave to gay   now  like    the rhetorician  vehemently strike     now  like the poet  deal a lighter hit    with easy playfulness and polished wit       veil the stern vigour of a soul robust     and flash your fancies  while like death you thrust     for men are more impervious  as a rule     to slashing censure than to ridicule     here lay the merit of those writers  who    in the old comedy our fathers drew     here should we struggle in their steps to tread    whom fop hermogenes has never read     nor that mere ape of his  who all day long    makes calvus and catullus all his song      the concluding hit at hermogenes tigellius and his double is very  characteristic of horace s manner  when he has worked up his description  of a vice to be avoided or a virtue to be pursued  he generally drives  home his lesson by the mention of some well known person s name  thus  importing into his literary practice the method taken by his father   as we have seen  to impress his ethical teachings upon himself in his  youth  the allusion to calvus and catullus  the only one anywhere made  to these poets by horace  is curious  but it would be wrong to infer  from it  that horace meant to disparage these fine poets  calvus had  a great reputation both as an orator and poet  but  except some  insignificant fragments  nothing of what he wrote is left  how catullus  wrote we do  however  know  and although it is conceivable that horace  had no great sympathy with some of his love verses  which were probably  of too sentimental a strain for his taste  we may be sure that he  admired the brilliant genius as well as the fine workmanship of many of  his other poems  at all events  he had too much good sense to launch a  sneer at so great a poet recently dead  which would not only have been  in the worst taste  but might justly have been ascribed to jealousy   when he talks  therefore  of a pair of fribbles who can sing nothing  but calvus and catullus  it is  as macleane has said in his note on the  passage   as if a man were to say of a modern english coxcomb  that  he could sing moore s ballads from beginning to end  but could not  understand a line of shakespeare    no disparagement to moore  whatever  it might be to the vocalist  hermogenes and his ape  whom we may  identify with one demetrius  who is subsequently coupled with him in the  same satire  were musicians and vocalists  idolised  after the manner of  modern italian singers  by the young misses of rome  pampered favourites  of fashion  the farinellis of the hour  their opinion on all matters of  taste was sure to be as freely given as it was worthless  they had been   moreover  so indiscreet as to provoke horace s sarcasm by running down  his verses  leave criticism  he rejoins  to men who have a right to  judge  stick to your proper vocation  and       to puling girls  that listen and adore     your love lorn chants and woeful wailings pour      in the same satire we have proof how warmly horace thought and spoke of  living poets  thus          in grave iambic measures pollio sings    for our delight the deeds of mighty kings     the stately epic varius leads along     and where is voice so resonant  so strong     the muses of the woods and plains have shed    their every grace and charm on virgil s head      with none of those will he compete  satire is his element  and there he  proclaims himself to be an humble follower of his great predecessor  but  while he bows to lucilius as his master  and owns him superior in  polish and scholarly grace to the satirists who preceded him  still  he  continues         still  were he living now  had only such    been fate s decree  he would have blotted much     cut everything away that could be called    crude or superfluous  or tame  or bald     oft scratched his head  the labouring poet s trick     and bitten all his nails down to the quick      and then he lays down the canon for all high class composition  which  can never be too often enforced          oh yes  believe me  you must draw your pen    not once or twice  but o er and o er again     through what you ve written  if you would entice    the man who reads you once to read you twice     not making popular applause your cue     but looking to find audience fit though few    c      he had himself followed the rule  and found the reward  with natural  exultation he appeals against the judgment of men of the hermogenes type  to an array of critics of whose good opinion he might well be proud          maecenas  virgil  varius   if i please    in my poor writings these and such as these       if plotius  valgius  fuscus will commend     and good octavius  i ve achieved my end     you  noble pollio  let your friend disclaim    all thoughts of flattery  when he names your name      messala and his brother  servius too     and bibulus  and furnius kind and true     with others  whom  despite their sense and wit     and friendly hearts  i purposely omit     such i would have my critics  men to gain    whose smiles were pleasure  to forget them pain    c      it is not strange that horace  even in these early days  numbered so  many distinguished men among his friends  for  the question of genius  apart  there must have been something particularly engaging in his  kindly and affectionate nature  he was a good hater  as all warm hearted  men are  and when his blood was up  he could  like diggory   remember  his swashing blow   he would fain  as he says himself  satires  ii       be at peace with all men          but he who shall my temper try       twere best to touch me not  say i      shall rue it  and through all the town    my verse shall damn him with renown      but with his friends he was forbearing  devoted  lenient to their  foibles  not boring them with his own  liberal in construing their  motives  and as trustful in their loyalty to himself as he was assured  of his own to them  clearly a man to be loved  a man pleasant to meet  and pleasant to remember  constant  and to be relied on in sunshine or  in gloom  friendship with him was not a thing to be given by halves   he could see a friend s faults no man quicker but it did not lie in his  mouth to babble about them  he was not one of those who  whisper faults  and hesitate dislikes   love me  love my friend  was his rule  neither  would he sit quietly by  while his friends were being disparaged  and if  he has occasion himself to rally their foibles in his poems  he does so  openly  and does it with such an implied sympathy and avowal of  kindred weakness in himself  that offence was impossible  above all  he  possessed in perfection what mr disraeli happily calls  the rare gift  of raillery  which flatters the self love of those whom it seems not  to spare   these characteristics are admirably indicated by persius  i        in speaking of his satires                arch horace  while he strove to mend     probed all the foibles of his smiling friend     played lightly round and round each peccant part     and won  unfelt  an entrance to his heart    gifford      and we may be sure the same qualities were even more conspicuous in his  personal intercourse with his friends  satirist though he was  he is  continually inculcating the duty of charitable judgments towards all  men        what s done we partly may compute       but know not what s resisted      is a thought often suggested by his works  the best need large grains of  allowance  and to whom should these be given if not to friends  here is  his creed on this subject  satires  i              true love  we know  is blind  defects  that blight    the loved one s charms  escape the lover s sight     nay  pass for beauties  as balbinus shows    a passion for the wen on agna s nose     oh  with our friendships that we did the same     and screened our blindness under virtue s name     for we are bound to treat a friend s defect    with touch most tender  and a fond respect     even as a father treats a child s  who hints     the urchin s eyes are roguish  if he squints     or if he be as stunted  short  and thick     as sisyphus the dwarf  will call him  chick      if crooked all ways  in back  in legs  and thighs     with softening phrases will the flaw disguise     so  if one friend too close a fist betrays     let us ascribe it to his frugal ways     or is another  such we often find      to flippant jest and braggart talk inclined      tis only from a kindly wish to try    to make the time  mongst friends go lightly by     another s tongue is rough and over free     let s call it bluntness and sincerity     another s choleric  him we must screen     as cursed with feelings for his peace too keen     this is the course  methinks  that makes a friend     and  having made  secures him to the end      what wonder  such being his practice  for horace in this as in other  things acted up to his professions  that he was so dear  as we see he  was  to so many of the best men of his time  the very contrast which  his life presented to that of most of his associates must have helped to  attract them to him  most of them were absorbed in either political  or military pursuits  wealth  power  dignity  the splendid prizes of  ambition  were the dream of their lives  and even those whose tastes  inclined mainly towards literature and art were not exempt from the  prevailing passion for riches and display  rich  they were eager to be  more rich  well placed in society  they were covetous of higher social  distinction  now at rome  gay  luxurious  dissipated  anon in spain   parthia  syria  africa  or wherever duty  interest  or pleasure called  them  encountering perils by land and sea with reckless indifference to  fatigue and danger  always with a hunger at their hearts for something   which  when found  did not appease it  they must have felt a peculiar  interest in a man who  without apparent effort  seemed to get so much  more out of life than they were able to do  with all their struggles   and all their much larger apparent means of enjoyment  they must have  seen that wealth and honour were both within his grasp  and they must  have known  too  that it was from no lack of appreciation of either that  he deliberately declined to seek them  wealth would have purchased for  him many a refined pleasure which he could heartily appreciate  and  honours might have saved him from some of the social slights which must  have tested his philosophy  but he told them  in every variety of  phrase and illustration  in ode  in satire  and epistle  that without  self control and temperance in all things  there would be no joy without  remorse  no pleasure without fatigue  that it is from within that  happiness must come  if it come at all  and that unless the mind has  schooled itself to peace by the renunciation of covetous desires        we may be wise  or rich  or great       but never can be blest      and as he spoke  so they must have seen he lived  wealth and honours  would manifestly have been bought too dearly at the sacrifice of the  tranquillity and independence which he early set before him as the  objects of his life        the content  surpassing wealth     the sage in meditation found      the content which springs from living in consonance with the dictates of  nature  from healthful pursuits  from a conscience void of offence  the  content which is incompatible with the gnawing disquietudes of avarice   of ambition  of social envy   with that in his heart  he knew he could  be true to his genius  and make life worth living for  a man of this  character must always be rare  least of all was he likely to be common  in horace s day  when the men in whose circle he was moving were engaged  in the great task of crushing the civil strife which had shaken the  stability of the roman power  and of consolidating an empire greater and  more powerful than her greatest statesmen had previously dreamed of   but all the more delightful to these men must it have been to come into  intimate contact with a man who  while perfectly appreciating their  special gifts and aims  could bring them back from the stir and  excitement of their habitual life to think of other things than social  or political successes   to look into their own hearts  and to live  for a time for something better and more enduring than the triumphs of  vanity or ambition     horace from the first seems to have wisely determined to keep himself  free from those shackles which most men are so eager to forge for  themselves  by setting their heart on wealth and social distinction   with perfect sincerity he had told maecenas  as we have seen  that he  coveted neither  and he gives his reasons thus  satires  i              for then a larger income must be made     men s favour courted  and their whims obeyed     nor could i then indulge a lonely mood     away from town  in country solitude     for the false retinue of pseudo friends     that all my movements servilely attends     more slaves must then be fed  more horses too     and chariots bought  now have i nought to do     if i would even to tarentum

this wise resolution he never swerved  and so through life he  maintained an attitude of independence in thought and action which would  otherwise have been impossible  he does not say it in so many words  but  the sentiment meets us all through his pages  which burns  whose mode of  thinking so often reminds us of horace  puts into the line        my freedom s a lairdship nae monarch may touch      and we shall hereafter have occasion to see that  when put to the proof   he acted upon this creed   well might the overworked statesman have  envied the poet the ease and freedom of his life  and longed to be able  to spend a day as horace  in the same satire  tells us his days were  passed          i walk alone  by mine own fancy led     inquire the price of potherbs and of bread     the

unclogged  like me     by stern ambition s miserable weight     so placed  i own with gratitude  my state    is sweeter  ay  than though a quaestor s power    from sire and grandsire s sires had been my dower      it would not have been easy to bribe a man of these simple habits and  tastes  as some critics have contended that horace was bribed  to become  the laureate of a party to which he had once been opposed  even had  maecenas wished to do so  his very indifference to those favours which  were within the disposal of a great minister of state  placed him on a  vantage ground in his relations with maecenas which he could in no other  way have secured  nor  we may well believe  would that distinguished man  have wished it otherwise  surrounded as he was by servility and selfish  baseness  he must have felt himself irresistibly drawn towards a nature  so respectful  yet perfectly manly and independent  as that of the  poet  nor can we doubt that intimacy had grown into friendship  warm  and sincere  before he gratified his own feelings  while he made horace  happy for life  by presenting him with a small estate in the sabine  country  a gift which  we may be sure  he knew well would be of all  gifts the most welcome  it is demonstrable that it was not given earlier  than b c      or after upwards of four years of intimate acquaintance   that horace had longed for such a possession  he tells us himself   satires  ii      he had probably expressed his longing in the hearing  of his friend  and to such a friend the opportunity of turning the  poet s dream into a reality must have been especially delightful     the gift was a slight one for maecenas to bestow  but  with horace s  fondness for the country  it had a value for him beyond all price  it  gave him a competency   satis superque   enough and more than he  wanted for his needs  it gave him leisure  health  amusement  and  more  precious than all  it secured him undisturbed freedom of thought  and  opportunities for that calm intercourse with nature which he  needed for  his spirit s health   never was gift better bestowed  or more worthily  requited  to it we are indebted for much of that poetry which has linked  the name of maecenas with that of the poet in associations the most  engaging  and has afforded  and will afford  ever new delight to  successive generations  the sabine farm was situated in the valley  of ustica  thirty miles from rome  and twelve miles from tivoli   it possessed the attraction  no small one to horace  of being very  secluded  varia  vico varo   the nearest town  being four miles  off  yet  at the same time  within an easy distance of rome  when his  spirits wanted the stimulus of society or the bustle of the capital   which they often did  his ambling mule could speedily convey him  thither  and when jaded  on the other hand  by the noise and racket and  dissipations of rome  he could  in the same homely way  bury himself  within a few hours among the hills  and there  under the shadow of his  favourite lucretilis  or by the banks of the clear flowing and ice cold  digentia  either stretch himself to dream upon the grass  lulled by the  murmurs of the stream  or do a little fanning in the way of clearing his  fields of stones  or turning over a furrow here and there with the hoe   there was a rough wildness in the scenery and a sharpness in the air   both of which horace liked  although  as years advanced and his health  grew more delicate  he had to leave it in the colder months for tivoli  or baiae  he built a villa upon it  or added to one already there  the  traces of which still exist  the farm gave employment to five families  of free  coloni   who were under the superintendence of a bailiff  and  the poet s domestic establishment was composed of eight slaves  the site  of the farm is at the present day a favourite resort of travellers   of englishmen especially  who visit it in such numbers  and trace its  features with such enthusiasm  that the resident peasantry   who  cannot conceive of any other source of interest in one so long dead and  unsainted than that of co patriotism or consanguinity   believe horace  to have been an englishman  footnote  letter by mr dennis  milman s   horace   london        p         what aspect it presented in horace s  time we gather from one of his epistles  i

the brink of the torrent digentia  we passed  a towering rock  on which once stood vacuna s shrine  and entered a  pastoral region of well watered meadow lands  enamelled with flowers and  studded with chestnut and fruit trees  beneath their sheltering shade  peasants were whiling away the noontide hours  here sat daphnis piping  sweet witching melodies on a reed to his rustic phidyle  whilst lydia  and she wove wreaths of wild flowers  and lyce sped down to the edge of  the stream and brought us cooling drink in a bulging conca borne on her  head  its waters were as deliciously refreshing as they could have been  when the poet himself gratefully recorded how often they revived his  strength  and one longed to think  and hence half believed  that our  homely hebe  like her fellows  was sprung from the coloni who tilled his  fields and dwelt in the five homesteads of which he sings      near  the little village of licenza  standing like its loftier neighbour   civitella  on a steep hill at the foot of lucretilis  we turned off the  path  crossed a thickly wooded knoll  and came to an orchard  in which  two young labourers were at work  we asked where the remains of horace s  farm were    a pie tui    answered the nearest of them  in a dialect  more like latin than italian  so saying  he began with a shovel to  uncover a massive floor in very fair preservation  a little farther on  was another  crumbling to pieces  chaupy has luckily saved one all doubt  as to the site of the farm  establishing to our minds convincingly that  it could scarcely have stood on ground other than that on which at this  moment we were  as the shovel was clearing the floors  we thought how  applicable to horace himself were the lines he addressed to fuscus  aristius   naturam expelles    c          drive nature forth by force  she ll turn and rout    the false refinements that would keep her out    c      for here was just enough of his home left to show how nature  creeping  on step by step  had overwhelmed his handiwork and reasserted her sway   again  pure and augustan in design as was the pavement before us  how  little could it vie with the hues and odours of the grasses that bloomed  around it    deterius libycis   c          is springing grass less sweet to nose and eyes    than libyan marble s tesselated dyes    c       indeed  so striking were these coincidences that we were as nearly as  possible going off on the wrong tack  and singing  io paean  to dame  nature herself at the expense of the bard  but we were soon brought back  to our allegiance by a sense of the way in which all we saw tallied  with the description of him who sang of nature so surpassingly well  who  challenges posterity in charmed accents  and could shape the sternest  and most concise of tongues into those melodious cadences that invest  his undying verse with all the magic of music and all the freshness of  youth  for this was clearly the  angulus iste   the nook which  restored  him to himself   this the lovely spot which his steward longed to  exchange for the slums of rome  below lay the greensward by the river   where it was sweet to recline in slumber  here grew the vines  still  trained  like his own  on the trunks and branches of trees  yonder the  brook which the rain would swell till it overflowed its margin  and his  lazy steward and slaves were fain to bank it up  and above  among a wild  jumble of hills  lay the woods where  on the calends of march  faunus  interposed to save him from the falling tree  and where another miracle  preserved him from the attack of the wolf as he strolled along unarmed   singing of the soft voice and sweet smiles of his lalage  the brook is  now nearly dammed up  a wall of close fitting rough hewn stones gathers  its waters into a still  dark pool  its overflow gushes out in a tiny  rill that rushed down beside our path  mingling its murmur with the hum  of myriads of insects that swarmed in the air      on this farm lovers of horace have been fain to place the fountain of  bandusia  which the poet loved so well  and to which he prophesied  and  truly  as the issue has proved  immortality from his song  odes  iii        charming as the poem is  there could be no stronger proof of the  poet s hold upon the hearts of men of all ages than the enthusiasm with  which the very site of the spring has been contested        bandusia s fount  in clearness crystalline       o worthy of the wine  the flowers we vow     to morrow shall be thine      a kid  whose crescent brow       is sprouting  all for love

touch  sweet cool thy waters yield    to ox with ploughing tired       and flocks that range afield        thou too one day shall win proud eminence       mid honoured founts  while i the ilex sing    crowning the cavern  whence      thy babbling wavelets spring    c      several commentators maintain  on what appears to be very inconclusive  grounds  that the fountain was at palazzo  six miles from venusia  but  the poem is obviously inspired by a fountain whose babble had often  soothed the ear of horace  long after he had ceased to visit venusia   on his farm  therefore  let us believe it to exist  whichever of  the springs that are still there we may choose to identify with his  description  for there are several  and the local guides are by no means  dogmatic as to the   vero fonte    that known as the  fonte della corte   seems to make out the strongest case for itself  it is within a few  hundred yards of the villa  most abundant  and in this respect  fit  to  name the river that there takes its rise  which the others  at present   at least  certainly are not     horace is never weary of singing the praises of his mountain  home    satis beatus unicis sabinis

misery of a millionaire in the midst of his splendour  again   in one of his odes to maecenas  iii      he takes up and expands the  same theme        in my crystal stream  my woodland  though its acres are but few     and the trust that i shall gather home my crops in season due     lies a joy  which he may never grasp  who rules in gorgeous state    fertile africa s dominions  happier

business all at his command      it is in this delightful retreat that  in one of his most graceful odes   he thus invites the fair tyndaris to pay him a visit  i               my own sweet lucretilis ofttime can lure  from his native lycaeus kind faunus the fleet     to watch o er my flocks  and to keep them secure      from summer s fierce winds  and its rains  and its heat        there the mates of a lord of too pungent a fragrance      securely through brake and o er precipice climb     and crop  as they wander in happiest vagrance       the arbutus green  and the sweet scented thyme

verse to the violence of the lady s  lover  a violence of which ladies of her class were constantly the  victims  rather suggests that this ode  if addressed to a real personage  at all  was meant less as an invitation to the sabine farm than as a  balm to the lady s wounded spirit     in none of his poems is the poet s deep delight in the country life of  his sabine home more apparent than in the following  satires  ii       which  both for its biographical interest and as a specimen of his best  manner in his satires  we give entire          my prayers with this i used to charge       a piece of land not very large     wherein there should a garden be     a clear spring flowing ceaselessly     and where  to crown the whole  there should    a patch be found of growing wood       all

had found     bought for himself the very ground    which he before for hire had tilled      if i with gratitude am filled    for what i have  by this i dare    adjure you to fulfil my prayer     that

talk our banquet rouses     but not about our neighbours  houses     or if  tis generally thought    that lepos dances well or not     but what concerns us nearer  and    is harmful not to understand

  half gnawed  of bacon  which he put    with his own mouth before his guest     in hopes  by offering his best    in such variety  he might    persuade him to an appetite     but still the cit  with

found their way     where shining ivory couches vied    with coverlets in purple dyed     and where in baskets were amassed    the wrecks of a superb repast     which some few hours before had closed     there  having first his friend disposed    upon a purple tissue  straight    the city mouse begins to wait    with scraps upon his country brother     each scrap more dainty than another     and

        and only hear the magpie gossip      garrulous  under a roof of pine      it is characteristic of horace that in the very next satire he makes his  own servant davus tell him that his rhapsodies about the country and  its charms are mere humbug  and that  for all his ridicule of the  shortcomings of his neighbours  he is just as inconstant as they are in  his likings and dislikings  the poet in this way lets us see into his  own little vanities  and secures the right by doing so to rally his  friends for theirs  to his valet  at all events  by his own showing  he  is no hero        you re praising up incessantly    the habits  manners  likings  ways     of people hi the good old days     yet should some god this moment give    to you the power  like them to live     you re

they retreat     which i had rather not repeat      who could take amiss the rebuke of the kindly satirist  who was so ready  to show up his own weaknesses  in this respect our own great satirist  thackeray is very like him  nor is this strange  they had many points  in common  the same keen eye for human folly  the same tolerance for the  human weaknesses of which they were so conscious in themselves  the same  genuine kindness of heart  thackeray s terse and vivid style  too   is probably in some measure due to this  that to him  as to malherbe   horace was a kind of breviary         chapter v     life in rome   horace s bore   extravagance of the roman dinners       it is one of the many charms of horace s didactic writings  that he  takes us into the very heart of the life of rome  we lounge with its  loungers along the via sacra  we stroll into the campus martius  where  young hebrus with his noble horsemanship is witching the blushing  neobule  already too much enamoured of the handsome liparian  and the  men of the old school are getting up an appetite by games of tennis   bowls  or quoits  while the young grecianised fops  lisping feeble  jokes  saunter by with a listless contempt for such vulgar gymnastics   we are in the via appia  barine sweeps along in her chariot in superb  toilette  shooting glances from her sleepy cruel eyes  the young fellows  are all agaze  what is this  young pompilius  not three months married   bows to her  with a visible spasm at the heart  as she hurries by   full in view of his young wife  who hides her mortification within the  curtains of her litter  and hastens home to solitude and tears  here  comes barrus  as ugly a dog as any in rome  dressed to death  and  smiling malvolio  smiles of self complacency  the girls titter and  exchange glances as he passes  barrus swaggers on  feeling himself an  inch taller in the conviction that he is slaughtering the hearts of the  dear creatures by the score  a mule  with a dead boar thrown across it   now winds its way among the chariots and litters  a little ahead of it  stalks gargilius  attended by a strong force of retainers armed with  spears and nets  enough to thin the game of the hercynian forest  little  does the mighty hunter dream  that all his friends  who congratulate him  on his success  are asking themselves and each other  where he bought  the boar  and for how much  have we never encountered a piscatory  gargilius near the spey or the tweed  we wander back into the city and  its narrow streets  in one we are jammed into a doorway by a train of  builders  waggons laden with huge blocks of stone  or massive logs  of timber  escaping these  we run against a line of undertakers  men    performing  a voluminous and expensive funeral  to the discomfort of  everybody and the impoverishment of the dead man s kindred  in the next  street we run the risk of being crushed by some huge piece of masonry in  the act of being swung by a crane into its place  and while calculating  the chances of its fall with upturned eye  we find ourselves landed in  the gutter by an unclean pig  which has darted between our legs at some  attractive garbage beyond  this peril over  we encounter at the next  turning a mad dog  who makes a passing snap at our toga as he darts  into a neighbouring blind alley  whither we do not care to follow his  vagaries among a covey of young roman street arabs  before we reach  home a mumping beggar drops before us as we turn the corner  in a  well simulated fit of epilepsy or of helpless lameness    quoere  peregrinum     try that game on country cousins    we mutter in our  beard  and retreat to our lodgings on the third floor  encountering  probably on the stair some half tipsy artisan or slave  who is  descending from the attics for another cup of fiery wine at the nearest  wine shop  we go to the theatre  the play is  ilione   by pacuvius  the  scene a highly sensational one  where the ghost of deiphobus  her son   appearing to ilione  beseeches her to give his body burial   oh mother   mother   he cries  in tones most raucously tragic   hear me call   but  the kynaston of the day who plays ilione has been soothing his maternal  sorrow with too potent falernian  he slumbers on  the populace  like the  gods of our gallery  surmise the truth  and   oh  mother  mother  hear  me call   is bellowed from a thousand lungs  we are enjoying a comedy   when our friends the people   the many headed monster of the pit   begin  to think it slow  and stop the performance with shouts for a show  of bears or boxers  or  hoping to hear a good play  we find the  entertainment offered consists of pure spectacle   inexplicable dumbshow  and noise          whole fleets of ships in long procession pass      and captive ivory follows captive brass    c      a milk white elephant or a camelopard is considered more than a  substitute for character  incident  or wit  and if an actor presents  himself in a dress of unusual splendour  the house is in ecstasies  and  a roar of applause  loud as a tempest in the garganian forest  or as  the surges on the tuscan strand  makes the velarium vibrate above their  heads  human nature is perpetually repeating itself  so when pope is  paraphrasing horace  he has no occasion to alter the facts  which  were the same in his pseudo  as in the real  augustan age  but only to  modernise the names          loud as the waves on orcas  stormy steep    howl to the roarings of the northern deep     such is the shout  the long applauding note     at quin s high plume  or oldfield s petticoat     booth enters  hark  the universal peal      but has he spoken   not a syllable      what shook the stage  and made the people stare       cato s long wig  flowered gown  and lackered chair       we dine out  maecenas is of the party  and comes in leaning heavily on  the two umbrae  guests of his own inviting  whom he has brought with  him   habitues of what augustus called his  parasitical table   who make  talk and find buffoonery for him  he is out of spirits to day  and more  reserved than usual  for a messenger has just come in with bad news from  spain  or he has heard of a conspiracy against augustus  which must be  crushed before it grows more dangerous  varius is there  and being a  writer of tragedies  keeps up  as your tragic author is sure to do  a  ceaseless fire of puns and pleasantry  at these young sybaris  smiles faintly  for his thoughts are away with his ladylove  the too  fascinating lydia  horace  who  from the other side of the table  with  an amused smile in his eyes  watches him  as he  sighs like furnace    while neaera  to the accompaniment of her lyre  sings one of sappho s  most passionate odes  whispers something in the ear of the brilliant  vocalist  which visibly provokes a witty repartee  with a special sting  in it for horace himself  at which the little man winces  for have there  not been certain love passages of old between neaera and himself  the  wine circulates freely  maecenas warms  and drops  with the deliberation  of a rich sonorous voice  now some sharp sarcasm  now some aphorism  heavy with meaning  which sticks to the memory  like a saying of  talleyrand s  his  umbrae   who have put but little of allaying tiber  in their cups  grow boisterous and abusive  and having insulted nearly  everybody at the table by coarse personal banter  the party breaks up   and we are glad to get out with flushed cheeks and dizzy head into  the cool air of an early summer night  all the more  that for the last  half hour young piso at our elbow has been importuning us with whispered  specimens of his very rickety elegiacs  and trying to settle an early  appointment for us to hear him read the first six books of the great  epic with which he means to electrify the literary circles  we reach the  fabrician bridge  meditating as we go the repartees with which we might  have turned the tables on those scurrilous followers of the great man   but did not  suddenly we run up against a gentleman  who  raising his  cloak over his head  is on the point of jumping into the tiber  we  seize him by his mantle  and discover in the intended suicide an old  acquaintance  equally well known to the jews and the bric a brac shops   whose tastes for speculation and articles of  vertu  have first brought  him to the money lenders  next to the dogs  and finally to the brink of  the yellow tiber  we give him all the sesterces we have about us  along  with a few sustaining aphorisms from our commonplace book upon the  folly  if not the wickedness  of suicide  and see him safely home  when  we next encounter the decayed  virtuoso   he has grown a beard  very  badly kept   and set up as a philosopher of the hyper virtuous jaques  school  of course he lectures us upon every vice which we have not  and  every little frailty which we have  with a pointed asperity that upsets  our temper for the day  and causes us long afterwards to bewail the  evil hour in which we rescued such an ill conditioned grumbler from the  kindly waters of the river     these hints of life and manners  all drawn from the pages of horace   might be infinitely extended  and a ramble in the streets of rome in the  present day is consequently fuller of vivid interest to a man who has  these pages at his fingers  ends than it can possibly be to any other  person  horace is so associated with all the localities  that one would  think it the most natural thing in the world to come upon him at any  turning  his old familiar haunts rise up about us out of the dust of  centuries  we see a short thick set man come sauntering along   more fat  than bard beseems   as he passes  lost in reverie  many turn round and  look at him  some point him out to their companions  and by what they  say  we learn that this is horace  the favourite of maecenas  the  frequent visitor at the unpretending palace of augustus  the self made  man and famous poet  he is still within sight  when his progress is  arrested  he is in the hands of a bore of the first magnitude  but what  ensued  let us hear from his own lips  satires  i             the bore       it chanced that i  the other day     was sauntering up the sacred way     and musing  as my habit is     some trivial random fantasies     that for the time absorbed me quite     when there comes running up a wight     whom only by his name i knew      ha  my dear fellow  how d ye do      grasping my hand  he shouted   why     as times go  pretty well   said i      and you  i trust  can say the same      but after me as still he came      sir  is there anything   i cried      you want of me    oh   he replied      i m

he cries     for all the while i d been stock dumb      i ve seen it this half hour  but come     let s clearly understand each other     it s no use making all this pother     my mind s made up  to

his end     away beyond the tiber far     close by where caesar s gardens are       i ve nothing in the world to do     and what s a paltry mile or two     i like it  so i ll follow you      down dropped my ears on hearing this     just like a vicious jackass s     that s loaded heavier than he likes     but off anew my torment strikes      if well i know myself  you ll end    with making of me more a friend    than viscus  ay  or varius  for    of verses who can run off more     or run them off at such a pace     who dance with such distinguished grace     and as for singing  zounds

 oh  day    of woeful doom to me  away    the rascal bolted like an arrow     and left me underneath the harrow     when  by the rarest luck  we ran    at the next turn against the man     who had the lawsuit with my bore      ha  knave   he cried with loud uproar      where are you off to  will you here    stand witness   i present my ear     to court he hustles him along     high words are bandied  high and strong     a mob collects  the fray to see     so did apollo rescue me     the satires appear to have been completed when horace was about  thirty five years old  and published collectively  b c      by this time  his position in society was well assured  he numbered among his friends   as we have seen  the most eminent men in rome          chiefs out of war  and statesmen out of place       men who were not merely ripe scholars  but who had borne and were  bearing a leading part in the great actions of that memorable epoch   among such men he would be most at home  for there his wit  his  shrewdness  his genial spirits  and high breeding would be best  appreciated  but his own keen relish of life  and his delight in  watching the lights and shades of human character  took him into that  wider circle where witty and notable men are always eagerly sought after  to grace the feasts or enliven the heavy splendour of the rich and the  unlettered  he was still young  and happy in the animal spirits which  make the exhausting life of a luxurious capital endurable even in spite  of its pleasures  what victor hugo calls       le banquet des amis  et quelquefois les soirs     le baiser jeune et frais d une blanche aux yeux noirs      never quite lost their charm for him  but during this period they must  often have tempted him into the elaborate dinners  the late hours  and  the high strung excitement  which made a retreat to the keen air and  plain diet of his sabine home scarcely less necessary for his body s  than it was for his spirit s health  for  much as he prized moderation  in all things  and extolled  the mirth that after no repenting draws    good wine  good company  and fair and witty women would be sure to work  their spell on a temperament so bright and sympathetic  and to quicken  his spirits into a brilliancy and force  dazzling for the hour  but to  be paid for next day in headache and depression     he was all the more likely to suffer in this way from the very fact  that  as a rule  he was simple and frugal in his tastes and habits  we  have seen him  p       in the early days of his stay in rome  at  his  plain meal of pancakes  pulse  and pease   served on homely  earthenware  at his farm  again  beans and bacon  p      form his staple  dish  true to the old roman taste  he was a great vegetarian  and in his  charming ode  written for the opening of the temple of apollo erected by  augustus on mount palatine  b c       he thinks it not out of place to  mingle with his prayer for poetic power an entreaty that he may never be  without wholesome vegetables and fruit        let olives  endive  mallows light       be all my fare  and health    give thou  apollo  so i might      enjoy my present wealth     give me but these  i ask no more       these  and a mind entire      an old age  not unhonoured  nor      unsolaced by the lyre      maecenas himself is promised  odes  iii       if he will visit the poet  at the sabine farm   simple dinners neatly dressed   and when horace  invites down his friend torquatus  epistles  ii      he does it on the  footing that this wealthy lawyer shall be content to put up with plain  vegetables and homely crockery   modica olus omne patella    the wine   he promises  shall be good  though not of any of the crack growths  if  torquatus wants better  he must send it down himself  the appointments  of the table  too  though of the simplest kind  shall be admirably  kept         the coverlets of faultless sheen     the napkins scrupulously clean     your cup and salver such that they    unto yourself yourself display      table service neat to a nicety was obviously a great point with  horace   what plate he had was made to look its best     ridet argento  domus     my plate  newly burnished  enlivens my rooms   is one of the  attractions held out in his invitation to the fair phyllis to grace his  table on maecenas s birthday  odes  iv       and we may be very sure  that his little dinners were served and waited on with the studied care  and quiet finish of a refined simplicity  his rule on these matters is  indicated by himself  satires  ii              the proper thing is to be cleanly and nice     and yet so as not to be over precise     to neither be constantly scolding your slaves     like that old prig albutus  as losels and knaves     nor  like naevius  in such things who s rather too easy     to the guests at your board present water that s greasy      to a man of these simple tastes the elaborate banquets  borrowed  from the asiatic greeks  which were then in fashion  must have been  intolerable  he has introduced us to one of them in describing a  dinner party of nine given by one nasidienus  a wealthy snob  to  maecenas and others of horace s friends  the dinner breaks down in a  very amusing way  between the giver s love of display and his parsimony   which prompted him  on the one hand  to present his guests with  the  fashionable dainties  but  on the other  would not let him pay a price  sufficient to secure their being good  the first course consists of  a lucanian wild boar  served with a garnish of turnips  radishes   and lettuce  in a sauce of anchovy brine and wine lees  next comes an  incongruous medley of dishes  including one       of sparrows  gall and turbots  liver     at the mere thought of which i shiver      a lamprey succeeds   floating vast and free  by shrimps surrounded in  a sea of sauce   and this is followed up by a crane soused in salt  and flour  the liver of a snow white goose fattened on figs  leverets   shoulders  and roasted blackbirds  this  menu  is clearly meant for a  caricature  but it was a caricature of a prevailing folly  which had  probably cost the poet many an indigestion     against this folly  and the ruin to health and purse which it entailed   some of his most vigorous satire is directed  it furnishes the themes  of the second and fourth satires of the second book  both of which   with slight modifications  might with equal truth be addressed to the  dinner givers and diners out of our own day  in the former of these the  speaker is the apulian yeoman ofellus  who undertakes to show       what the virtue consists in  and why it is great     to live on a little  whatever your state      before entering on his task  however  he insists that his hearers shall  cut themselves adrift from their luxuries  and come to him fasting  and  with appetites whetted by a sharp run with the hounds  a stiff bout at  tennis  or some other vigorous gymnastics          and when the hard work has your squeamishness routed     when you re parched up with thirst  and your hunger s undoubted     then spurn simple food if you can  or plain wine     which no honied gums from hymettus refine      his homily then proceeds in terms which would not be out of place if  addressed to a  gourmet  of modern london or paris          when your butler s away  and the weather s so bad    that there is not a morsel of fish to be had     a crust with some salt will soothe not amiss    the ravening stomach  you ask  how is this     because for delight  at the best  you must look    to yourself  and not to your wealth or your cook        work till you perspire  of all sauces  tis best     the man that s with over indulgence oppressed     white livered and pursy  can relish no dish     be it ortolans  oysters  or finest of fish     still i scarcely can hope  if before you there were    a peacock and capon  you would not prefer    with the peacock to tickle your palate  you re so    completely the dupes of mere semblance and show     for to buy the rare bird only gold will avail     and he makes a grand show with his fine painted tail     as if this had to do with the matter the least     can you make of the feathers you prize so a feast     and  when the bird s cooked  what becomes of its splendour     is his flesh than the capon s more juicy or tender     mere appearance  not substance  then  clearly it is     which bamboozles your judgment  so much  then  for this             pour l amour de dieu  un sou pour acheter un petit pain

                will it give you a notion    if this pike in the tiber was caught  or the ocean     if it used  twixt the bridges to glide and to quiver     or was tossed to and fro at the mouth of the river      just as our epicures profess to distinguish  by flavour a salmon fresh   run from the sea from one that has been degenerating for four and twenty  hours in the fresh water of the river  with this difference  however   that  unlike the salmon with us  the above bridge pike was considered at  rome to be more delicate than his sea bred and leaner brother     ofellus next proceeds to ridicule the taste which prizes what is set  before it for mere size or rarity or cost  it is this  he contends  and  not any excellence in the things themselves  which makes people load  their tables with the sturgeon or the stork  fashion  not flavour   prescribes the rule  indeed  the more perverted her ways  the more sure  they are to be followed        so were any one now to assure us a treat

mischief is done to a man    by a great mass of dishes   remembering that    plain fare of old times  and how lightly it sat     but the moment you mingle up boiled with roast meat     and shellfish

you  to hear    such wisdom  be it far or near     for though you tell me all  in fact     your memory is most exact      still there must be some grace of speech     which no interpreter can reach

matters so solemn and serious as the gusts  and  flavours  and  sacred rage  of a highly educated appetite  at the same  time  there is no reason to suppose him to have been insensible to the  attractions of the   haute cuisine    as developed by the genius of the  vattel or francatelli of maecenas  and others of his wealthy friends   indeed  he appears to have been prone  rather than otherwise  to attack  these with a relish  which his feeble digestion had frequent reason to  repent  his servant davus more than hints as much in the passage above  quoted  p       and the consciousness of his own frailty may have given  additional vigour to his assaults on the ever increasing indulgence  in the pleasures of the table  which he saw gaining ground so rapidly  around him         chapter vi     horace s love poetry       when young  horace threw himself ardently into the pleasures of youth   and his friends being  for the most part  young and rich  their banquets  were sure to be sumptuous  and carried far into the night  nor in  these days did the   blanche aux yeux noirs    whose beauty and  accomplishments formed the crowning grace of most bachelors  parties   fail to engage a liberal share of his attention  he tells us as much  himself  epistles  i       when contrasting to the steward of his farm  the tastes of his maturer years with the habits of his youth          he  whom fine clothes became  and glistering hair       whom cinara welcomed  that rapacious fair       as well you know  for his own simple sake       who on from noon would wine in

feasting  frolic  fun  they ve swept away        and to the first of these  life  in his hot youth  manifestly owed much  of its charm     to beauty he would appear to have been always susceptible  but his was  the lightly stirred susceptibility which is an affair of the senses  rather than of the soul   there is in truth   says rochefoucauld   only  one kind of love  but there are a thousand different copies of it    horace  so far at least as we can judge from his poetry  was no stranger  to the spurious form of the passion  but his whole being had never been  penetrated by the genuine fire  the goddess of his worship is not venus  urania  pale  dreamy  spiritual  but  erycina ridens  quam jocus circum  volat et cupido   who comes       with laughter in her eyes  and love    and glee around her flying      accordingly  of all those infinitely varied chords of deep emotion and  imaginative tenderness  of which occasional traces are to be found in  the literature of antiquity  and with which modern poetry  from dante to  tennyson  is familiar  no hint is to be found in his pages  his  deepest feeling is at best but a ferment of the blood  it is never  the all absorbing devotion of the heart  he had learned by his own  experience just enough of the tender passion to enable him to write  pretty verses about it  and to rally  not unsympathetically  such of his  friends as had not escaped so lightly from the flame  therefore it is  that  as has been truly said   his love ditties are  as it were  like  flowers  beautiful in form and rich in hues  but without the scent that  breathes to the heart   we seek in them in vain for the tenderness  the  negation of self  the passion and the pathos  which are the soul of all  true love poetry     at the same time  horace had a subtle appreciation of the beauty and  grace  the sweetness and the fascination  of womanhood  poet as he was   he must have delighted to contemplate the ideal elevation and purity of  woman  as occasionally depicted in the poetry of greece  and of which  he could scarcely fail to have had some glimpses in real life  nay  he  paints  odes  iii      the devotion of hypermnestra for her husband s  sake  magnificently false    splendide mendax   to the promise which   with her sister danaids  she had given to her father  in a way that  proves he was not incapable of appreciating  and even of depicting   the purer and higher forms of female worth  but this exquisite portrait  stands out in solitary splendour among the lydes and lalages  the  myrtales  phrynes  and glyceras of his other poems  these ladies were  types of the class with which  probably  he was most familiar  those  brilliant and accomplished  hetairae   generally greeks  who were  trained up in slavery with every art and accomplishment which could  heighten their beauty or lend a charm to their society  always  beautiful  and by force of their very position framed to make themselves  attractive  these  weeds of glorious feature   naturally enough  took  the chief place in the regards of men of fortune  in a state of  society where marriage was not an affair of the heart but of money or  connection  and where the wife so chosen seems to have been at pains to  make herself more attractive to everybody rather than to her husband   here and there these aspasias made themselves a distinguished position   and occupied a place with their protector nearly akin to that of wife   but in the ordinary way their reign over any one heart was shortlived   and their career  though splendid  was brief   a youth of folly  a  premature old age of squalor and neglect  their habits were luxurious  and extravagant  in dress they outvied the splendour  not insignificant   of the roman matrons  and they might be seen courting the admiration of  the wealthy loungers of rome by dashing along the appian way behind a  team of spirited ponies driven by themselves  these things were often  paid for out of the ruin of their admirers  their society  while in the  bloom and freshness of their charms  was greatly sought after  for  wit and song came with them to the feast  even cicero  then well up in  years  finds a pleasant excuse  familiar letters  ix      for enjoying  till a late hour the society of one cytheris  a lady of the class  at  the house of volumnius eutrapelus  her protector  his friend atticus was  with him  and although cicero finds some excuse necessary  it is still  obvious that even grave and sober citizens might dine in such equivocal  company without any serious compromise of character     it was perhaps little to be wondered at that horace did not squander his  heart upon women of this class  his passions were too well controlled   and his love of ease too strong  to admit of his being carried away by  the headlong impulses of a deeply seated devotion  this would probably  have been the case even had the object of his passion been worthy of an  unalloyed regard  as it was        his loves were like most other loves     a little glow  a little shiver      and if he sometimes had  like the rest of mankind  to pay his homage  to the universal passion by  sighing upon his midnight pillow  for  the regards of a mistress whom he could not win  or who had played him  false  he was never at a loss to find a balm for his wounds elsewhere   he was not the man to nurse the bitter sweet sorrows of the heart  to  write  and to feel  like burns          tis sweeter for thee despairing     than aught in the world beside       parabilem amo venerem facilemque    give me the beauty that is not too  coy   is the alpha and omega of his personal creed  how should it have  been otherwise  knowing woman chiefly  as he obviously did  only in the  ranks of the  demi monde   he was not likely to regard the fairest face   after the first heyday of his youth was past  as worth the pain its  owner s caprices could inflict  for  as seen under that phase  woman was  apt to be both mercenary and capricious  and if the poet suffered  as  he did  from the fickleness of more than one mistress  the probability  is  and this he was too honest not to feel  that they had only  forestalled him in inconstancy     if horace ever had a feeling which deserved the name of love  it was  for the cinara mentioned in the lines above quoted  she belonged to  the class of hetairae  but seems to have preferred him  from a genuine  feeling of affection  to her wealthier lovers  holding him as she did  completely under her thraldom  it was no more than natural that she  should have played with his emotions  keeping him between ecstasy and  torture  as such a woman  especially if her own heart were also somewhat  engaged  would delight to do with a man in whose love she must have  rejoiced as something to lean upon amid the sad frivolities of her life   the exquisite pain to which her caprices occasionally subjected him was  more than he could bear in silence  and drove him  despite his quick  sense of the ridiculous  into lachrymose avowals to maecenas of  his misery over his wine  which were  doubtless  no small source of  amusement to the easy going statesman  before his wife terentia had  taught him by experience what infinite torture a charming and coquettish  woman has it in her power to inflict  long years afterwards  when he is  well on to fifty  horace reminds his friend  epistles  i     of       the woes blabbed o er our wine  when cinara chose    to tease me  cruel flirt  ah  happy woes        words in which lurks a subtle undercurrent of pathos  like that in  sophie arnould s exclamation in le brun s epigram          oh  le bon temps  j etais bien malheureuse      twice also in his later odes  iv    and      horace recurs with  tenderness to the  gentle cinara  as having held the paramount place in  his heart  she was his one bit of romance  and this all the more that  she died young   cinarae breves annos fata dederunt    few years the  fates to cinara allowed   and in his meditative rambles by the digentia   the lonely poet  we may well believe  often found himself sighing  for  the touch of a vanished hand  and the sound of a voice that is still      in none of his love poems is the ring of personal feeling more  perceptible than in the following  it is one of his earliest  and if  we are to identify the neaera to whom it is addressed with the neaera  referred to in ode     book iii   it must have been written  consule  planco   that is  in the year of horace s return to rome after the  battle of philippi           twas night   let me recall to thee that night       the silver moon in the unclouded sky    amid the lesser stars was shining bright       when  in the words i did adjure thee by     thou with thy clinging arms  more tightly knit      around me than the ivy clasps the oak     didst breathe a vow  mocking the gods with it        a vow which  false one  thou hast foully broke     that while the ravening wolf should hunt the flocks       the shipman s foe  orion  vex the sea     and zephyrs waft the unshorn apollo s locks       so long wouldst thou be fond  be true to me        yet shall thy heart  neaera  bleed for this       for if in flaccus aught of man remain     give thou another joys that once were his       some other maid more true shall soothe his pain     nor think again to lure him to thy heart       the pang once felt  his love is past recall     and thou  more favoured youth  whoe er thou art       who revell st now in triumph o er his fall     though thou be rich in land and golden store       in lore a sage  with shape framed to beguile     thy heart shall ache when  this brief fancy o er       she seeks a new love  and i calmly smile      this is the poetry of youth  the passion of wounded vanity  but it is  clearly the product of a strong personal feeling  a feeling which has  more often found expression in poetry than the higher emotions of those  with whom  love is love for evermore   and who have infinite pity  but  no rebuke  for faithlessness  the lines have been often imitated  and in  sir robert aytoun s poem on  woman s inconstancy   the imitation has a  charm not inferior to the original        yet do thou glory in thy choice       thy choice of his good fortune boast     i ll neither grieve nor yet rejoice      to see him gain what i have lost       the height of my disdain shall be     to laugh at him  to blush for thee     to love thee still  yet go no more     a begging to a beggar s door      note how horace deals with the same theme in his ode to pyrrha  famous  in milton s overrated translation  and the difference between the young  man writing under the smart of wounded feeling and the poet  calmly  though intensely elaborating his subject as a work of art  becomes at  once apparent        pyrrha  what slender boy  in perfume steeped       doth in the shade of some delightful grot    caress thee now on couch with roses heaped       for whom dost thou thine amber tresses knot       with all thy seeming artless grace  ah me       how oft will he thy perfidy bewail     and joys all flown  and shudder at the sea      rough with the chafing of the blust rous gale        who now  fond dreamer  revels in thy charms       who  all unweeting how the breezes veer     hopes still to find a welcome in thine arms      as warm as now  and thee as loving dear        ah  woe for those on whom thy spell is flung       my votive tablet  in the temple set     proclaims that i to ocean s god have hung      the vestments in my shipwreck smirched and wet      it may be that among horace s odes some were directly inspired by the  ladies to whom they are addressed  but it is time that modern criticism  should brush away all the elaborate nonsense which has been written to  demonstrate that pyrrha  chloe  lalage  lydia  lyde  leuconoe  tyndaris   glycera  and barine  not to mention others  were real personages to whom  the poet was attached  at this rate his occupations must have rather  been those of a don giovanni than of a man of studious habits and  feeble health  who found it hard enough to keep pace with the milder  dissipations of the social circle  we are absolutely without any  information as to these ladies  whose liquid and beautiful names are  almost poems in themselves  nevertheless the most wonderful romances  have been spun about them out of the inner consciousness of the  commentators  who would venture to deal in this way with the eleanore   and  rare pale margaret   and cousin amy  of mr tennyson  and yet to  do so would be quite as reasonable as to conclude  as some critics have  done  that such a poem as the following  odes  i      was not a graceful  poetical exercise merely  but a serious appeal to the object of a  serious passion          nay  hear me  dearest chloe  pray       you shun me like a timid fawn     that seeks its mother all the day      by forest brake and upland  lawn     of every passing breeze afraid     and leaf that twitters in the glade        let but the wind with sudden rush      the whispers of the wood awake     or lizard green disturb the hush       quick darting through the grassy brake     the foolish frightened thing will start     with trembling knees and beating heart           but i am neither lion fell      nor tiger grim to work you woe     i love you  sweet one  much too well       then cling not to your mother so     but to a lover s fonder arms    confide your ripe and rosy charms            the same idea has been beautifully worked out by spenser  in whom      and in milton  the influence of horace s poetry is perhaps more     frequently traceable than in any of our poets              like as an hynde forth singled from the herde         that hath escaped from a ravenous beast         yet flies away  of her own feet afearde         and every leaf  that shaketh with the least        murmure of winde  her terror hath encreast         so fled fayre florimel from her vaine feare         long after she from perill was releast         each shade she saw  and each noyse she did heare         did seeme to be the same  which she escaypt whileare          fairy queen  iii  vii        such a poem as this  one should have supposed  might have escaped the  imputation of being dictated by mere personal desire  but no  even so  acute a critic as walckenaer will have it that chloe was one of horace s  many mistresses  to whom he fled for consolation when lydia  another of  them  played him false   et qu il l a recherchee avec empressement   and  his sole ground for this conclusion is the circumstance that a chloe  is mentioned in this sense in the famous dialogue  in which horace and  lydia have quite gratuitously been assumed to be the speakers  that is  to say  he first assumes that the dialogue is not a mere exercise of  fancy  but a serious fact  and  having got so far  concludes as a matter  of course that the chloe of the one ode is the chloe of the other   the  ancients   as buttmann has well said   had the skill to construct such  poems so that each speech tells us by whom it is spoken  but we let  the editors treat us all our lives as schoolboys  and interline such  dialogues  as we do our plays  with the names  even in an english poem  we should be offended at seeing collins by the side of phyllis   read  without the prepossession which the constant mention of it as a dialogue  between horace and lydia makes it difficult to avoid  the ode commends  itself merely as a piece of graceful fancy  real feeling is the last  thing one looks for in two such excessively well bred and fickle  personages as the speakers  their pouting and reconciliation make very  pretty fooling  such as might be appropriate in the wonderful beings who  people the garden landscapes of watteau  but where are the fever and the  strong pulse of passion which  in less ethereal mortals  would be proper  to such a theme  had there been a real lady in the case  the tone would  have been less measured  and the strophes less skilfully balanced        he   whilst i was dear and thou wert kind            and i  and i alone  might lie         upon thy snowy breast reclined            not persia s king so blest as i       she   whilst i to thee was all in all            nor chloe might with lydia vie          renowned in ode or madrigal            not roman ilia famed as i       he   i now am thracian chloe s slave            with hand and voice that charms the air          for whom even death itself i d brave            so fate the darling girl would spare       she   i dote on calais  and i            am all his passion  all his care           for whom a double death i d die             so fate the darling boy would spare       he   what  if our ancient love return             and bind us with a closer tie           if i the fair haired chloe spurn             and as of old  for lydia sigh       she   though lovelier than yon star is he             and lighter thou than cork  ah why           more churlish  too  than adria s sea             with thee i d live  with thee i d die      in this graceful trifle horace is simply dealing with one of the  commonplaces of poetry  most probably only transplanting a greek flower  into the latin soil  there is more of the vigour of originality and of  living truth in the following ode to barine  ii      where he gives us  a cameo portrait  carved with exquisite finish  of that  beaute  de diable    dallying and dangerous   as charles lamb called peg  woffington s  and  what hers was not  heartless  which never dies out of  the world  a real person  lord lytton thinks   was certainly addressed   and in a tone which  to such a person  would have been the most  exquisite flattery  and as certainly the person is not so addressed by  a lover   a criticism which  coming from such an observer  outweighs the  opposite conclusions of a score of pedantic scholars          if for thy perjuries and broken truth        barine  thou hadst ever come to harm      hadst lost  but in a nail or blackened tooth         one single charm        i d trust thee  but when thou art most forsworn       thou blazest forth with beauty most supreme     and of our young men art  noon  night  and morn         the thought  the dream        to thee  tis gain thy mother s dust to mock       to mock the silent watchfires of the night     all heaven  the gods  on whom death s icy shock        can never light        smiles venus  self  i vow  to see thy arts       the guileless nymphs and cruel cupid smile     and  smiling  whets on bloody stone his darts        of fire the while        nay more  our youth grow up to be thy prey       new slaves throng round  and those who crouched at first     though oft they threaten  leave not for a day        thy roof accurst        thee mothers for their unfledged younglings dread       thee niggard old men dread  and brides new made     in misery  lest their lords neglect their bed         by thee delayed      horace is more at home in playful raillery of the bewildering effects of  love upon others  than in giving expression to its emotions as felt by  himself  in the fourteenth epode  it is true  he begs maecenas to excuse  his failure to execute some promised poem  because he is so completely  upset by his love for a certain naughty phryne that he cannot put a  couple of lines together  again  he tells us  odes  i      into what  a ferment his whole being has been thrown  long after he had thought  himself safe from such emotions  by the marble like sheen of glycera s  beauty  her  grata protervitas  et voltus nimium lubricus adspici          her pretty  pert  provoking ways       and face too fatal fair to see      the first ode of the fourth book is a beautiful fantasia on a similar  theme  he paints  too  the tortures of jealousy with the vigour  odes   i      of a man who knew something of them          then reels my brain  then on my cheek      the shifting colour comes and goes     and tears  that flow unbidden  speak      the torture of my inward throes     the fierce unrest  the deathless flame     that slowly macerates my frame      and when rallying his friend tibullus  odes  i      about his doleful  ditties on the fickleness of his mistress glycera  he owns to having  himself suffered terribly in the same way  but despite all this  it is  very obvious that if love has  in rosalind s phrase   clapped him on the  shoulder   the little god left him  heart whole   being  as it is  the  source of the deepest and strongest emotions  love presents many aspects  for the humorist  and perhaps to no one more than to him who has felt it  intensely  horace may or may not have sounded the depths of the passion  in his own person  but  in any case  a fellow feeling for the lover s  pleasures and pains served to infuse a tone of kindliness into his  ridicule  how charming in this way is the ode to lydia  i      of which  the late henry luttrel s once popular and still delightful  letters to  julia  is an elaborate paraphrase            why  lydia  why     i pray  by all the gods above       art so resolved that sybaris should die     and all for love         why doth he shun    the campus martius  sultry glare       he that once recked of neither dust nor sun     why rides he there         first of the brave     taming the gallic steed no more       why doth he shrink from tiber s yellow wave     why thus abhor        the wrestlers  oil     as  twere from viper s tongue distilled       why do his arms no livid bruises soil     he  once so skilled         the disc or dart    far  far beyond the mark to hurl       and tell me  tell me  in what nook apart     like baby girl         lurks the poor boy     veiling his manhood  as did thetis  son       to  scape war s bloody clang  while fated troy    was yet undone      in the same class with this poem may be ranked the following ode  i        just as the poet has made us as familiar with the lovelorn sybaris  as if we knew him  so does he here transport us into the middle of  a wine party of young romans  with that vivid dramatic force which  constitutes one great source of the excellence of his lyrics        hold  hold   tis for thracian madmen to

you      in this poem  which has all the effect of an impromptu  we have a   genre  picture of roman life  as vivid as though painted by the pencil  of couture or gerome     serenades were as common an expedient among the roman gallants of the  days of augustus as among their modern successors  in the fine climate  of greece  italy  and spain  they were a natural growth  and involved  no great strain upon a wooer s endurance  they assume a very different  aspect under a northern sky  where young absolute  found by his lydia  languish  in the garden  in the coldest night in january  stuck like a  dripping statue   presents a rather lugubrious spectacle  horace  odes   iii     warns the fair asterie  during the absence of her husband  abroad  to shut her ears against the musical nocturnes of a certain  enipeus          at nightfall shut your doors  nor then     look down into the street again       when quavering fifes complain      using almost the words of shylock to his daughter jessica          lock up my doors  and when you hear the drum     and the vile squeaking of the wrynecked fife      clamber not you up to the casement then     nor thrust your head into the public street      the name given to such a serenade  adopted probably  with the serenades  themselves  from greece  was  paraclausithyron   literally  an  out of door lament  here is a specimen of what they were  odes  iii        in which  under the guise of imitating their form  horace quietly  makes a mock of the absurdity of the practice  his serenader has none of  the insensibility to the elements of the lover in the scotch song          wi  the sleet in my hair  i d gang ten miles and mair       for a word o  that sweet lip o  thine  o  thine       for ae glance o  thy dark e e divine      neither is there in his pleading the tone of earnest entreaty which  marks the wooer  in a similar plight  of burns s  let me in this ae  nicht          thou hear st the winter wind and weet     nae star blinks through the driving sleet     tak pity on my weary feet       and shield me frae the rain  jo      there can be no mistake as to the seriousness of this appeal  horace s  is a mere  jeu d esprit           though your drink were tanais  chillest of rivers       and your lot with some conjugal savage were cast     you would pity  sweet lyce  the poor soul that shivers      out here at your door in the merciless blast        only hark how the doorway goes straining and creaking       and the piercing wind pipes through the trees that surround    the court of your villa  while hack frost is streaking      with ice the crisp snow that lies thick on the ground        in your pride  venus hates it  no longer envelop ye       or haply you ll find yourself laid on the shelf     you never were made for a prudish penelope        tis not in the blood of your sires or yourself        though nor gifts nor entreaties can win a soft answer       nor the violet pale of my love ravaged cheek     to your husband s intrigue with a greek ballet dancer       though you still are blind  and forgiving and meek        yet be not as cruel  forgive my upbraiding        as snakes  nor as hard as the toughest of oak     to stand out here  drenched to the skin  serenading      all night may in time prove too much of a joke      it is not often that horace s poetry is vitiated by bad taste  strangely  enough  almost the only instances of it occur where he is writing of  women  as in the ode to lydia  book i      and to lyce  book iv        both ladies seem to have been  former favourites of his  and yet the  burden of these poems is exultation in the decay of their charms  the  deadening influence of mere sensuality  and of the prevalent low tone  of morals  must indeed have been great  when a man  so singularly  susceptible   as lord lytton has truly described him   to amiable   graceful  gentle  and noble impressions of man and of life   could write  of a woman whom he had once loved in a strain like this          the gods have heard  the gods have heard my prayer       yes  lyce  you are growing old  and still        you struggle to look fair           you drink  and dance  and trill    your songs to youthful love  in accents weak      with wine  and age  and passion  youthful love         he dwells in chia s cheek           and hears her harp strings move     rude boy  he flies like lightning o er the heath      past withered trees like you  you re wrinkled now         the white has left your teeth           and settled on your brow     your coan silks  your jewels bright as stars        ah no  they bring not back the days of old         in public calendars          by flying time enrolled     where now that beauty  where those movements  where      that colour  what of her  of her is left         who  breathing love s own air           me of myself bereft     who reigned in cinara s stead  a fair  fair face       queen of sweet arts  but fate to cinara gave        a life of little space           and now she cheats the grave    of lyce  spared to raven s length of days       that youth may see  with laughter and disgust         a firebrand  once ablaze           now smouldering in grey dust      what had this wretched lyce done that horace should have prayed the gods  to strip her of her charms  and to degrade her from a haughty beauty  into a maudlin hag  disgusting and ridiculous  why cast such very  merciless stones at one who  by his own avowal  had erewhile witched his  very soul from him  why rejoice to see this once beautiful creature the  scoff of all the heartless young fops of rome  if she had injured him   what of that  was it so very strange that a woman trained  like all  the class to which she belonged  to be the plaything of man s caprice   should have been fickle  mercenary  or even heartless  poor lyce might  at least have claimed his silence  if he could not do  what thackeray  says every honest fellow should do   think well of the woman he has once  thought well of  and remember her with kindness and tenderness  as a man  remembers a place where he has been very happy      horace s better self comes out in his playful appeal to his friend  xanthias  odes  ii     not to be ashamed of having fallen in love with  his handmaiden phyllis  that she is a slave is a matter of no account   a girl of such admirable qualities must surely come of a good stock  and  is well worth any man s love  did not achilles succumb to briseis  ajax  to tecmessa  agamemnon himself to cassandra  moreover        for aught that you know  the fair phyllis may be      the shoot of some highly respectable stem     nay  she counts  never doubt it  some kings in her tree       and laments the lost acres once lorded by them     never think that a creature so exquisite grew      in the haunts where but vice and dishonour are known     nor deem that a girl so unselfish  so true       had a mother  twould shame thee to take for thine own      here we have the true horace  and after all these fascinating but  doubtful lydes  neaeras  and pyrrhas  it is pleasant to come across a  young beauty like this phyllis   sic fidelem  sic lucro aversam   she   at least  is a fresh and fragrant violet among the languorous hothouse  splendours of the horatian garden     domestic love  which plays so large a part in modern poetry  is a theme  rarely touched on in roman verse  hence we know but little of the romans  in their homes  for such a topic used to be thought beneath the dignity  of history  and especially little of the women  who presided over what  have been called  the tender and temperate honours of the hearth    the ladies who flourish in the poetry and also in the history of those  times  however conspicuous for beauty or attraction  are not generally  of the kind that make home happy  such matrons as we chiefly read of  there would in the present day he apt to figure in the divorce court   nor is the explanation of this difficult  the prevalence of marriage for  mere wealth or connection  and the facility of divorce  which made the  marriage tie almost a farce among the upper classes  had resulted  as  it could not fail to do  in a great debasement of morals  a lady did not  lose caste either by being divorced  or by seeking divorce  from  husband after husband  and as wives in the higher ranks often held the  purse strings  they made themselves pretty frequently more dreaded than  beloved by their lords  through being tyrannical  if not unchaste   or both  so at least horace plainly indicates  odes  iii       when  contrasting the vices of rome with the simpler virtues of some of the  nations that were under its sway  in those happier lands  he says    nec  dotata regit virum conjux  nec nitido fidit adultero             no dowried dame her spouse    o erbears  nor trusts the sleek seducer s vows      but it would be as wrong to infer from this that the taint was  universal  as it would be to gauge our own social morality by the  erratic matrons and fast young ladies with whom satirical essayists  delight to point their periods  the human heart is stronger than the  corruptions of luxury  even among the luxurious and the rich  and the  life of struggle and privation which is the life of the mass of every  nation would have been intolerable but for the security and peace of  well ordered and happy households  sweet honest love  cemented by years  of sympathy and mutual endurance  was then  as ever  the salt of human  life  many a monumental inscription  steeped in the tenderest pathos   assures us of the fact  what  for example  must have been the home of  the man who wrote on his wife s tomb   she never caused me a pang but  when she died   and catullus  mere man of pleasure as he was  must have  had strongly in his heart the thought of what a tender and pure souled  woman had been in his friend s home  when he wrote his exquisite lines  to calvus on the death of quinctilia          calvus  if those now silent in the tomb      can feel the touch of pleasure in our tears    for those we loved  that perished in their bloom       and the departed friends of former years      oh  then  full surely thy quinctilia s woe      for the untimely fate  that bids thee part     will fade before the bliss she feels to know      how very dear she is unto thy heart      horace  the bachelor  revered the marriage tie  and did his best  by his  verses  to forward the policy of augustus in his effort to arrest the  decay of morals by enforcing the duty of marriage  which the well to do  romans of that day were inclined to shirk whenever they could  nay   the charm of constancy and conjugal sympathy inspired a few of his very  finest lines  odes  i  l      felices ter et amplius  quos irrupta tenet  copula     c    the feeling of which is better preserved in moore s  well known paraphrase than is possible in mere translation          there s a bliss beyond all that the minstrel has told       when two that are linked in one heavenly tie     with heart never changing  and brow never cold       love on through all ills  and love on till they die     one hour of a passion so sacred is worth      whole ages of heartless and wandering bliss     and oh  if there be an elysium on earth       it is this  it is this      to leave the  placens uxor    the winsome wife   behind  is one of the  saddest regrets  horace tells his friend posthumus  odes  ii        which death can baring  still horace only sang the praises of marriage   contenting himself with painting the eden within which  for reasons  unknown to us  he never sought to enter  he was well up in life   probably  before these sager views dawned upon him  was it then too late  to reduce his precepts to practice  or was he unable to overcome his  dread of the  dotata conjux   and thought his comfort would be safer in  the hands of some less exacting fair  such as the phyllis to whom the  following ode  one of his latest  iv       is addressed          i have laid in a cask of albanian wine       which nine mellow summers have ripened and more     in my garden  dear phyllis  thy brows to entwine       grows the brightest of parsley in plentiful store     there is ivy to gleam on thy dark glossy hair       my plate  newly burnished  enlivens my rooms     and the altar  athirst for its victim  is there       enwreathed with chaste vervain and choicest of blooms        every hand in the household is busily toiling       and hither and thither boys bustle and girls     whilst  up from the hearth fires careering and coiling       the smoke round the rafter beams languidly curls     let the joys of the revel be parted between us        tis the ides of young april  the day which divides    the month  dearest phyllis  of ocean sprung venus       a day to me dearer than any besides        and well may i prize it  and hail its returning        my own natal day not more hallowed nor dear     for maecenas  my friend  dates from this happy morning      the life which has swelled to a lustrous career     you sigh for young telephus  better forget him       his rank is not yours  and the gaudier charms    of a girl that s both wealthy and wanton benet him       and hold him the fondest of slaves in her arms        remember fond phaethon s fiery sequel       and heavenward aspiring bellerophon s fate     and pine not for one who would ne er be your equal       but level your hopes to a lowlier mate     so  come  my own phyllis  my heart s latest treasure        for ne er for another this bosom shall long      and i ll teach  while your loved voice re echoes the measure       how to charm away care with the magic of song      this is very pretty and picturesque  and maecenas was sure to be charmed  with it as a birthday ode  for such it certainly was  whether there was  any real phyllis in the case or not  most probably there was not   the  allusion to telephus  the lady killer  is so very like many other  allusions of the same kind in other odes  which are plainly mere  exercises of fancy  and the protestation that the lady is the very  very  last of his loves  so precisely what all middle aged gentlemen think it  right to say  whose   jeunesse    like the poet s  has teen notoriously    orageuse       it was probably not within the circle of his city friends that horace  saw the women for whom he entertained the deepest respect  but by the  hearth fire in the farmhouse   the homely house  that harbours quiet  rest   with which he was no less familiar  where people lived in a  simple and natural way  and where  if anywhere  good wives and mothers  were certain to be found  it was manifestly by some woman of this class  that the following poem  odes  iii      was inspired          if thou  at each new moon  thine upturned palms       my rustic phidyle  to heaven shalt lift     the lares soothe with steam of fragrant balms       a sow  and fruits new plucked  thy simple gift        nor venomed blast shall nip thy fertile vine       nor mildew blight thy harvest in the ear     nor shall thy flocks  sweet nurslings  peak and pine       when apple bearing autumn chills the year        the victim marked for sacrifice  that feeds      on snow capped algidus  in leafy lane    of oak and ilex  or on alba s meads       with its rich blood the pontiff s axe may stain        thy little gods for humbler tribute call      than blood of many victims  twine for them    of rosemary a simple coronal       and the lush myrtle s frail and fragrant stem        the costliest sacrifice that wealth can make      from the incensed penates less commands    a soft response  than doth the poorest cake       if on the altar laid with spotless hands      when this was written  horace had got far beyond the epicurean creed  of his youth  he had come to believe in the active intervention of a  supreme disposer of events in the government of the world     insignem  attenuans  obscura promens    odes  i               the mighty ones of earth o erthrowing         advancing the obscure        and to whose  pure eyes and perfect witness  a blameless life and a  conscience void of offence were not indifferent         chapter vii     horace s poems to his friends   his praises of contentment       if it be merely the poet  and not the lover  who speaks in most of  horace s love verses  there can never be any doubt that the poems to his  friends come direct from his heart  they glow with feeling  to whatever  chord they are attuned  sad  or solemn  or joyous  they are always  delightful  consummate in their grace of expression  while they have all  the warmth and easy flow of spontaneous emotion  take  for example  the  following  odes  ii      pompeius varus  a fellow student with horace  at athens  and a brother in arms under brutus  who  after the defeat of  philippi  had joined the party of the younger pompey  has returned to  rome  profiting probably by the general amnesty granted by octavius  to his adversaries after the battle of actium  how his heart must have  leapt at such a welcome from his poet friend as this          dear comrade in the days when thou and i      with brutus took the field  his perils bore       who hath restored thee  freely as of yore     to thy home gods  and loved italian sky        pompey  who wert the first my heart to share       with whom full oft i ve sped the lingering day       quaffing bright wine  as in our tents we lay     with syrian spikenard on our glistening hair        with thee i shared philippi s headlong flight       my shield behind me left  which was not well       when all that brave array was broke  and fell    in the vile dust full many a towering wight        but me  poor trembler  swift mercurius bore       wrapped in a cloud  through all the hostile din       whilst war s tumultuous eddies  closing in     swept thee away into the strife once more        then pay to jove the feasts that are his fee       and stretch at ease these war worn limbs of thine      beneath my laurel s shade  nor spare the wine    which i have treasured through long years for thee        pour till it touch the shining goblet s rim       care drowning massic  let rich ointments flow      from amplest conchs  no measure we shall know     what  shall we wreaths of oozy parsley trim        or simple myrtle  whom will venus    send      to rule our revel  wild my draughts shall be      as thracian bacchanals   for  tis sweet to me    to lose my wits  when i regain my friend            venus was the highest cast of the dice  the meaning here is  who     shall be the master of our feast   that office falling to the     member of the wine party who threw sixes     when horace penned the playful allusion here made to having left his  shield on the field of battle   parmula non bene relicta    he could  never have thought that his commentators  professed admirers  too  would  extract from it an admission of personal cowardice  as if any man   much more a roman to romans  would make such a confession  horace could  obviously afford to put in this way the fact of his having given up a  desperate cause  for this very reason  that he had done his duty on the  field of philippi  and that it was known he had done it  commentators  will be so cruelly prosaic  the poet was quite as serious in saying that  mercury carried him out of the  melee  in a cloud  like one of homer s  heroes  as that he had left his shield discreditably   non bene   on  the battle field  but it requires a poetic sympathy  which in classical  editors is rare  to understand that  as lessing and others have  urged  the very way he speaks of his own retreat was by implication  a compliment  not ungraceful  to his friend  who had continued the  struggle against the triumvirate  and come home at last  war worn  and weary  to find the more politic comrade of his youth one of the  celebrities of rome  and on the best of terms with the very men against  whom they had once fought side by side     not less beautiful is the following ode to septimius  another of the  poet s old companions in arms  odes  ii      his speaking of himself in  it as  with war and travel worn  has puzzled the commentators  as it  is plain from the rest of the poem that it must have been written long  after his campaigning days were past  but the fatigues of those days may  have left their traces for many years  and the difficulty is at once  got over if we suppose the poem to have been written under some little  depression from languid health due to this cause  tarentum  where his  friend lived  and whose praises are so warmly sung  was a favourite  resort of the poet s  he used to ride there on his mule  very possibly  to visit septimius  before he had his own sabine villa  and all his love  for that villa never chilled his admiration for tibur  with its  silvan  shades  and orchards moist with wimpling rills    the   tiburni lucus   et uda mobilibus pomaria rivis    and its milder climate  so genial to  his sun loving temperament          septimius  thou who wouldst  i know     with me to distant gades go     and visit the cantabrian fell     whom all our triumphs cannot quell     and even the sands barbarian brave     where ceaseless seethes the moorish wave        may tibur  that delightful haunt     reared by an argive emigrant     the tranquil haven be  i pray     for my old age to wear away     oh  may it be the final bourne    to one with war and travel worn        but should the cruel fates decree    that this  my friend  shall never be   then to galaesus  river sweet  to skin clad flocks  will i retreat     and those rich meads  where sway of yore    laconian phalanthus bore        in all the world no spot there is     that wears for me a smile like this     the honey of whose thymy fields    may vie with what hymettus yields     where berries clustering every slope    may with venafrum s greenest cope        there jove accords a lengthened spring     and winters wanting winter s sting     and sunny aulon s    broad incline    such mettle puts into the vine     its clusters need not envy those    which fiery falernum grows        thyself and me that spot invites     those pleasant fields  those sunny heights     and there  to life s last moments true     wilt thou with some fond tears bedew      the last sad tribute love can lend      the ashes of thy poet friend            galaesus  galaso   a river  aulon  a hill near tarentum     septimius was himself a poet  or thought himself one  who        holding vulgar ponds and runnels cheap     at pindar s fount drank valiantly and deep      as horace says of him in an epistle  i     to julius florus  adding   with a sly touch of humour  which throws more than a doubt on the poetic  powers of their common friend          thinks he of me  and does he still aspire    to marry theban strains to latium s lyre     thanks to the favouring muse  or haply rage    and mouth in bombast for the tragic stage      when this was written septimius was in armenia along with florus  on  the staff of tiberius claudius nero  the future emperor  for this  appointment he was probably indebted to horace  who applied for it  at  his request  in the following epistle to tiberius  i      which  addison   spectator        cites as a fine specimen of what a letter of  introduction should be  horace was  on principle  wisely chary of giving  such introductions        look round and round the man you recommend     for yours will be the shame if he offend    c      is his maxim on this subject  epistles  i           and he was sure  to be especially scrupulous in writing to tiberius  who  even in his  youth  and he was at this time about twenty two  was so morose and  unpleasant in his manners  to say nothing of his ample share of the  hereditary pride of the claudian family  that even augustus felt under  constraint in his company          septimius only understands   twould seem     how high i stand in  claudius  your esteem     for when he begs and prays me  day by day     before you his good qualities to lay     as not unfit the heart and home to share    of nero  who selects his friends with care     when he supposes you to me extend    the rights and place of a familiar friend     far better than myself he sees and knows     how far with you my commendation goes     pleas without number i protest i ve used     in hope he d hold me from the task excused     yet feared the while it might be thought i feigned    too low the influence i perchance have gained     dissembling it as nothing with my friends     to keep it for my own peculiar ends     so  to escape such dread reproach  i put    my blushes by  and boldly urge my suit     if then you hold it as a grace  though small     to doff one s bashfulness at friendship s call     enrol him in your suite  assured you ll find    a man of heart in him  as well as mind      we may be very sure that  among the many pleas urged by horace for not  giving septimius the introduction he desired  was the folly of leaving  his delightful retreat at tarentum to go once more abroad in search of  wealth or promotion  let others  cross  to plunder provinces  the main    surely this was no ambition for an embryo pindar or half developed  aeschylus  horace had tried similar remonstrances before  and with just  as little success  upon iccius  another of his scholarly friends  who  sold off his fine library and joined an expedition into arabia felix   expecting to find it an el dorado  he playfully asks this studious  friend  odes  i       from whom he expected better things    pollicitus  meliora    if it be true that he grudges the arabs their wealth  and is  actually forging fetters for the hitherto invincible sabaean monarchs   and those terrible medians  to which of the royal damsels does he intend  to throw the handkerchief  having first cut down her princely betrothed  in single combat  or what young  oiled and curled  oriental prince is  for the future to pour out his wine for him  iccius  like many another  raleigh  went out to gather wool  and came back shorn  the expedition  proved disastrous  and he was lucky in being one of the few who survived  it  some years afterwards we meet with him again as the steward of  agrippa s great estates in sicily  he has resumed his studies          on themes sublime alone intent       what causes the wild ocean sway     the seasons what from june to may     if free the constellations roll     or moved by some supreme control     what makes the moon obscure her light     what pours her splendour on the night      absorbed in these and similar inquiries  and living happily on  herbs  and frugal fare   iccius realises the noble promise of his youth   and horace  in writing to him  epist   i       encourages him in his  disregard of wealth by some of those hints for contentment which the  poet never tires of reproducing          let no care trouble you  for poor    that man is not  who can insure    whate er for life is needful found     let your digestion be but sound     your side unwrung by spasm or

them as platitudes  horace abounds in  commonplaces  and on no theme more than this  he has no divine law of  duty to appeal to  as we have  no assured hereafter to which he may  point the minds of

beat not thy brains to  foreknow them   it was characteristic of an age of luxury that it should  be one of superstition and mental disquietude  eager to penetrate the  future  and credulous in its belief of those who pretended to unveil its  secrets  in such an age astrology naturally found many dupes  rome was  infested with professors of that so called science  who had flocked  thither from the east  and were always ready  like other oracles  to  supply responses acceptable to their votaries  in what contempt horace  held their prognostications the following ode  i      very clearly  indicates  the women of rome  according to juvenal  were great believers  in astrology  and carried manuals of it on their persons  which they  consulted before they took an airing or broke their fast  possibly on  this account horace addressed the ode to a lady  but in such things  and  not under the roman empire only  there have always been  as la fontaine  says    bon nombre d hommes qui sont

nor fondly to to morrow trust more than you must or may      in the verses of horace we are perpetually reminded that our life is  compassed round with darkness  but he will not suffer this darkness to  overshadow his cheerfulness  on the contrary  the beautiful world  and  the delights it offers  are made to stand out  as it were  in brighter  relief against the gloom of orcus  thus  for example  this very gloom  is made the background in the following ode  i     for the brilliant  pictures which crowd on the poet s fancy with the first burst of spring   here  he says  oh sestius  all is fresh and joyous  luxuriant and  lovely  be happy  drink in  at every pore the spirit of the season    while the roses are fresh within your hair  and the wine cup flashes  ruby in your hand  yonder lies pluto s meagrely appointed mansion  and  filmy shadows of the dead are waiting for you there  to swell their  joyless ranks  to that unlovely region you must go  alas  too soon  but  the golden present is yours  so drain it of its sweets        as biting winter flies  lo  spring with sunny skies       and balmy airs  and barks long dry put out again from shore     now the ox forsakes his byre  and the husbandman his fire       and daisy dappled meadows bloom where winter frosts lay hoar        by cytherea led  while the moon shines overhead       the nymphs and graces  hand in hand  with alternating feet    shake the ground  while swinking vulcan strikes the sparkles fierce  and red    from the forges of the cyclops  with reiterated beat         tis the time with myrtle green to bind our glistening locks       or with flowers  wherein the loosened earth herself hath newly  dressed   and to sacrifice to faunus in some glade amidst the rocks      a yearling lamb  or else a kid  if such delight him best        death comes alike to all  to the monarch s lordly hall       or the hovel of the beggar  and his summons none shall stay     oh  sestius  happy sestius  use the moments as they pass       far reaching hopes are not for us  the creatures of a day        thee soon shall night enshroud  and the manes  phantom crowd       and the starveling house unbeautiful of pluto shut thee in     and thou shalt not banish care by the ruddy wine cup there       nor woo the gentle lycidas  whom all are mad to win      a modern would no more think of using such images as those of the last  two verses to stimulate the festivity of his friends than he would of  placing  like the old egyptians  a skull upon his dinner table  or of  decorating his ball room with holbein s  dance of death   we rebuke our  pride or keep our vanities in check by the thought of death  and our  poets use it to remind us that       the glories of our blood and state      are shadows  not substantial things      horace does this too  but out of the sad certainty of mortality he  seems to extract a keener zest for the too brief enjoyment of the flying  hours  why is this  probably because by the pagan mind life on this side  the grave was regarded as a thing more precious  more noble  than the  life beyond  that there was a life beyond was undoubtedly the general  belief    sunt aliquid manes  letum non omnia finit  luridaque evictos  effugit umbra rogos            the manes are no dream  death closes not    our all of being  and the wan visaged shade    escapes unscathed from the funereal fires      says propertius  eleg  iv      and unless this were so  there would be  no meaning whatever in the whole pagan idea of hades  in the   domus  exilis plutonia    in the hermes driving the spirits of the dead across  the styx  in the   judicantem aeacum  sedesque  discretas piorum    the   aeacus dispensing doom  and the elysian fields serene   odes  ii        but this after life was a cold  sunless  unsubstantial thing  lower  in quality and degree than the full  vigorous  passionate life of this  world  the nobler spirits of antiquity  it hardly need be said  had  higher dreams of a future state than this  for them  no more than for  us  was it possible to rest in the conviction that their brief and  troubled career on earth was to be the  be all and the end all  of  existence  or that those whom they had loved and lost in death became  thenceforth as though they had never been  it is idle to draw  as is  often done  a different conclusion from such phrases as that after  death we are a shadow and mere dust    pulvis et umbra sumus    or from  horace s bewildered cry  odes  i       when a friend of signal nobleness  and purity is suddenly struck down    ergo quinctilium perpetuus sopor  urget      and is quinctilius  then  weighed down by a sleep that  knows no waking   we might as reasonably argue that shakespeare did not  believe in a life after death because he makes prospero say                 we are such stuff    as dreams are made of  and our little life    is rounded with a sleep      horace and shakespeare both believed in an immortality  but it was an  immortality different in its kind  horace  indeed   who  as a rule  is  wisely silent on a question which for him had no solution  however much  it may have engaged his speculations   has gleams not unlike those  which irradiate our happier creed  as when he writes  odes  iii     of    virtus  recludens immeritis mori coelum  negata tentat iter via           worth  which heaven s gates to those unbars      who never should have died     a pathway cleaves among the stars       to meaner souls denied      but they are only gleams  impassioned hopes  yearnings of the  unsatisfied soul in its search for some solution of the great mystery  of life  to him  therefore  it was of more moment than it was to us  to  make the most of the present  and to stimulate his relish for what it  has to give by contrasting it with a phantasmal future  in which no  single faculty of enjoyment should be left     take from life the time spent in hopes or fears or regrets  and how  small the residue  for the same reason  therefore  that he prized life  intensely  horace seems to have resolved to keep these consumers of its  hours as much at bay as possible  he would not look too far forward even  for a pleasure  for hope  he knew  comes never unaccompanied by her twin  sister fear  like the persian poet  omar khayyam  this is ever in his  thoughts              what boots it to repeat     how time is slipping underneath our feet       unborn to morrow  and dead yesterday     why fret about them if to day be sweet       to day  that alone is ours  let us welcome and note what it brings  and   if good  enjoy it  if evil  endure  let us  in any case  keep our  eyes and senses open  and not lose their impressions in dreaming of  an irretrievable past or of an impenetrable future   write it on your  heart   says emerson   society and solitude     that every day is the  best day in the year  no man has learned anything rightly until he knows  that every day is doomsday     ah  poor dupe  will you never learn that  as soon as the irrecoverable years have woven their blue glories between  to day and us  these passing hours shall glitter  and draw us  as the  wildest romance and the homes of beauty and poetry   horace would have  hailed a brother in the philosopher of new england     even in inviting maecenas to his sabine farm  odes  iii       he does  not think it out of place to remind the minister of state  worn with  the cares of government  and looking restlessly ahead to anticipate its  difficulties  that it may  after all  be wiser not to look so far ahead   or to trouble himself about contingencies which may never arise  we  must not think that horace undervalued that essential quality of  true statesmanship  the   animus rerum prudens    odes  iv      the  forecasting spirit that  looks into the seeds of time   and reads the  issues of events while they are still far off  he saw and prized the  splendid fruits of the exercise of this very power in the growing  tranquillity and strength of the roman empire  but the wisest may  over study a subject  maecenas may have been working too hard  and  losing under the pressure something of his usual calmness  and horace   while urging him to escape from town for a few days  may have had it in  view to insinuate the suggestion  that jove smiles  not at the common  mortal merely  but even at the sagacious statesman  who is over anxious  about the future    ultra fas trepidat    and to remind him that  after  all        there s a divinity that shapes our ends

have borne us in their flight       the poet here passes  by one of those sudden transitions for which he is  remarkable  into the topic of the fickleness of fortune  which seems to  have no immediate connection with what has gone before   but only seems   for this very fickleness is but a fresh reason for making ourselves  by  self possession and a just estimate of what is essential to happiness

melancholy temperament  and liable to great depression  of spirits  not only was his health at no time robust  but he was  constitutionally prone to fever  which more than once proved nearly  fatal to him  on his first appearance in the theatre after one of these  dangerous attacks  he was received with vehement cheers  and horace  alludes twice to this incident in his odes  as if he knew that it had  given especial pleasure to his friend  to mark the event the poet laid  up in his cellar a jar of sabine wine  and some years afterwards he  invites maecenas to come and partake of it in this

tree  and  what to  him was a great aggravation of the disaster  upon his own beloved farm   odes  ii       he links the two events together as a marked coincidence  in the following ode  ii       his friend had obviously been a prey to  one of his fits of low spirits  and vexing the kindly soul of the poet  by gloomy anticipations of an early death  suffering  as maecenas did   from those terrible attacks of sleeplessness to which he was subject   and which he tried ineffectually to soothe by the plash of falling water  and the sound of distant music   footnote  had horace this in his mind  when he wrote   non avium citharoeque cantus somnum reducent      odes   iii       nor song of birds  nor music of the lyre  shall his lost  sleep restore    such misgivings were only too natural  the case was  too serious this time for horace to think of rallying his friend into  a brighter humour  he may have even seen good cause to share his fears   for his heart is obviously moved to its very depths  and his sympathy  and affection well out in words  the pathos of which is still as fresh  as the day they first came with comfort to the saddened spirits of  maecenas himself        why wilt

whene er thou leadest  both      the last sad road below     me neither the chimaera s fiery breath     nor gyges  even could gyges rise from death        with all his hundred hands from thee shall sever       for in such sort it hath    pleased the dread fates  and justice potent ever       to interweave our path         beneath whatever aspect thou wert born     libra  or scorpion fierce  or capricorn        the blustering tyrant of the western deep       this well i know  my friend     our stars in wondrous wise one orbit keep       and in one radiance blend     from thee were saturn s baleful rays afar    averted by great jove s refulgent star        and his hand stayed fate s downward swooping wing       when thrice with glad acclaim    the teeming theatre was heard to ring       and thine the honoured name     so had the falling timber laid me low     but pan in mercy warded off the blow        pan who keeps watch o er easy souls like mine       remember  then  to rear    in gratitude to jove a votive shrine       and slaughter many a steer     whilst i  as fits  an humbler tribute pay     and a meek lamb upon his altar lay            so cowley  in his poem on the death of mr william harvey            he was my friend  the truest friend on earth       a strong and mighty influence joined our birth      what the poet  in this burst of loving sympathy  said would happen  did  happen almost as he foretold it  maecenas  first deceased   and horace   like the wife in the quaint  tender  old epitaph                             for a little tried    to live without him  liked it not  and died      but this was not till many years after this ode was written  which must  have been about the year b c      when horace was thirty nine  maecenas  lived for seventeen years afterwards  and often and often  we may  believe  turned to read the ode  and be refreshed by it  when his pulse  was low  and his heart sick and weary     horace included it in the first series of the odes  containing books i   and ii   which he gave to the world  b c       the first of these odes   like the first of the satires  is addressed to maecenas  they had  for the most part been written  and were  no doubt  separately in  circulation several years before  that they should have met with success  was certain  for the accomplished men who led society in rome must have  felt their beauty even more keenly than the scholars of a more recent  time  these lyrics brought the music of greece  which was their ideal   into their native verse  and a feeling of national pride must have  helped to augment their admiration  horace had tuned his ear upon the  lyres of sappho and alcaeus  he had even in his youth essayed to imitate  them in their own tongue   a mistake as great as for goethe or heine to  have tried to put their lyrical inspiration into the language of herrick  or of burns  but horace was preserved from perseverance in this mistake  by his natural good sense  or  as he puts it himself  with a fair poetic  licence  satires  i       by rome s great founder quirinus warning him  in a dream  that       to think of adding to the mighty throng    of the great paragons of grecian song     were no less mad an act than his who should    into a forest carry logs of wood      these exercises may not  however  have been without their value in  enabling him to transfuse the melodic rhythm of the greeks into his  native verse  and as he was the first to do this successfully  if we  except catullus in some slight but exquisite poems  so he was the last    of lyrists   says quintilian   horace is alone  one might say  worthy  to be read  for he has bursts of inspiration  and is full of playful  delicacy and grace  and in the variety of his images  as well as in  expression  shows a most happy daring   time has confirmed the verdict   and it has recently found eloquent expression in the words of one of our  greatest scholars        horace s style   says mr h  a  j  munro  in the introduction to his  edition of the poet   is throughout his own  borrowed from none who  preceded him  successfully imitated by none who came after him  the  virgilian heroic was appropriated by subsequent generations of poets   and adapted to their purposes with signal success  the hendecasyllable  and scazon of catullus became part and parcel of the poetic heritage of  rome  and martial employs them only less happily than their matchless  creator  but the moulds in which horace cast his lyrical and his  satirical thoughts were broken at his death  the style neither of  persius nor of juvenal has the faintest resemblance to that of their  common master  statius  whose hendecasyllables are passable enough   has given us one alcaic and one sapphic ode  which recall the bald and  constrained efforts of a modern schoolboy  i am sure he could not have  written any two consecutive stanzas of horace  and if he could not  who  could      before he published the first two books of his odes  horace had fairly  felt his wings  and knew they could carry him gracefully and well  he no  longer hesitates  as he had done while a writer of satires only  p        to claim the title of poet  but at the same time he throws himself  in  his introductory ode  with a graceful deference  upon the judgment of  maecenas  let that only seal his lyrics with approval  and he will feel  assured of his title to rank with the great sons of song          do thou but rank me  mong    the sacred bards of lyric song     i ll soar beyond the lists of time     and strike the stars with head sublime      in the last ode  also addressed to maecenas  of the second book   the poet gives way to a burst of joyous anticipation of future fame   figuring himself as a swan soaring majestically across all the then  known regions of the world  when he puts forth the third book several  years afterwards  he closes it with a similar paean of triumph  which   unlike most prophecies of the kind  has been completely fulfilled  in  both he alludes to the lowliness of his birth  speaking of himself in  the former as a child of poor parents    pauperum sanguis parentum     in the latter as having risen to eminence from a mean estate   ex humili  potens    these touches of egotism  the sallies of some brighter hour   are not merely venial  they are delightful in a man so habitually  modest        i ve reared a monument  my own       more durable than brass     yea  kingly pyramids of stone      in height it doth surpass        rain shall not sap  nor driving blast      disturb its settled base     nor countless ages rolling past      its symmetry deface        i shall not wholly die  some part       nor that a little  shall    escape the dark destroyer s dart       and his grim festival        for long as with his vestals mute      rome s pontifex shall climb    the capitol  my fame shall shoot      fresh buds through future time        where brawls loud aufidus  and came      parch d daunus erst  a horde    of rustic boors to sway  my name      shall be a household word        as one who rose from mean estate       the first with poet fire    aeolic song to modulate      to the italian lyre        then grant  melpomene  thy son      thy guerdon proud to wear     and delphic laurels  duly won       bind thou upon my hair          chapter ix     horace s relations with augustus   his love of independence       no intimate friend of maecenas was likely to be long a stranger to  augustus  and it is most improbable that augustus  who kept up his love  of good literature amid all the distractions of conquest and empire   should not have early sought the acquaintance of a man of such  conspicuous ability as horace  but when they first became known to each  other is uncertain  in more than one of the epodes horace speaks of him   but not in terms to imply personal acquaintance  some years further on  it is different  when trebatius  satires  ii     is urging the poet   if write he must  to renounce satire  and to sing of caesar s triumphs   from which he would reap gain as well as glory  horace replies          most worthy sir  that s just the thing    i d like especially to sing     but at the task my spirits faint     for  tis not every one can paint    battalions  with their bristling wall    of pikes  and make you see the gaul     with  shivered spear  in death throe bleed     or parthian stricken from his steed      then why not sing  rejoins trebatius  his justice and his fortitude        like sage lucilius  in his lays    to scipio africanus  praise      the reply is that of a man who had obviously been admitted to personal  contact with the caesar  and  with instinctive good taste  recoiled from  doing what he knew would be unacceptable to him  unless called for by  some very special occasion          when time and circumstance suggest     i shall not fail to do my best     but never words of mine shall touch    great caesar s ear  but only such    as are to the occasion due     and spring from my conviction  too     for stroke him with an awkward hand     and he kicks out  you understand      an allusion  no doubt  to the impatience entertained by augustus  to  which suetonius alludes  of the indiscreet panegyrics of poetasters by  which he was persecuted  the gossips of rome clearly believed  satires   ii     that the poet was intimate with caesar  for he is  so close  to the gods   that is  on such a footing with augustus and his chief  advisers  that they assume  as a matter of course  he must have early  tidings of all the most recent political news at first hand  however  this may be  by the time the odes were published horace had overcome any  previous scruples  and sang in no measured terms the praises of him   the back stroke of whose rebuke he had professed himself so fearful of  provoking     all horace s prepossessions must have been against one of the leaders  before whose opposition brutus  the ideal hero of his youthful  enthusiasm  had succumbed  neither were the sanguinary proscriptions and  ruthless spoliations by which the triumvirate asserted its power   and from a large share of the guilt of which augustus could not shake  himself free  calculated to conciliate his regards  he had much to  forget and to forgive before he could look without aversion upon the  blood stained avenger of the great caesar  but in times like those in  which horace s lot was cast  we do not judge of men or things as we do  when social order is unbroken  when political crime is never condoned   and the usual standards of moral judgment are rigidly enforced  horace  probably soon came to see  what is now very apparent  that when brutus  and his friends struck down caesar  they dealt a deathblow to what   but for this event  might have proved to be a well ordered government   liberty was dead long before caesar aimed at supremacy  it was dead when  individuals like sulla and marius had become stronger than the laws  and  the death of caesar was  therefore  but the prelude to fresh disasters   and to the ultimate investiture with absolute power of whoever  among  the competitors for it  should come triumphantly out of what was sure to  be a protracted and a sanguinary struggle  in what state did horace  find italy after his return from philippi  drenched in the blood of its  citizens  desolated by pillage  harassed by daily fears of internecine  conflict at home and of invasion from abroad  its sovereignty a stake  played for by political gamblers  in such a state of things it was no  longer the question  how the old roman constitution was to be restored   but how the country itself was to be saved from ruin  prestige was with  the nephew of the caesar whose memory the roman populace had almost  from his death worshipped as divine  and whose conspicuous ability and  address  as well as those of his friends  naturally attracted to his  side the ablest survivors of the party of brutus  the very course of  events pointed to him as the future chief of the state  lepidus  by the  sheer weakness and indecision of his character  soon went to the wall   and the power of antony was weakened by his continued absence from  rome  and ultimately destroyed by the malign influence exerted upon  his character by the fascinations of the egyptian queen cleopatra  the  disastrous failure of his parthian expedition  b c       and the tidings  that reached rome from time to time of the mad extravagance of his  private life  of his abandonment of the character of a roman citizen   and his assumption of the barbaric pomp and habits of an oriental  despot  made men look to his great rival as the future head of the  state  especially as they saw that rival devoting all his powers to the  task of reconciling divisions and restoring peace to a country exhausted  by a long series of civil broils  of giving security to life and  property at home  and making rome once more a name of awe throughout the  world  was it  then  otherwise than natural that horace  in common with  many of his friends  should have been not only content to forget the  past  with its bloody and painful records  but should even have attached  himself cordially to the party of augustus  whatever the private aims of  the caesar may have been  his public life showed that he had the welfare  of his country strongly at heart  and the current of events had made it  clear that he at least was alone able to end the strife of faction by  assuming the virtual supremacy of the state     pollio  messalla  varus  and others of the brutus party  have not been  denounced as renegades because they arrived at a similar conclusion  and  lent the whole influence of their abilities and their names to the  cause of augustus  horace has not been so fortunate  and because he  has expressed   what was no doubt the prevailing feeling of his  countrymen   gratitude to augustus for quelling civil strife  for  bringing glory to the empire  and giving peace  security  and  happiness to his country by the power of his arms and the wisdom of  his administration  the poet has been called a traitor to the nobler  principles of his youth  an obsequious flatterer of a man whom he ought  to have denounced to posterity as a tyrant   adroit esclave  is the  epithet applied to him in this respect by voltaire  who idolises him as  a moralist and poet  but it carries little weight in the mouth of  the cynic who could fawn with more than courtierly complaisance on  a frederick or a catherine  and weave graceful flatteries for the  pompadour  and who  dearly loved a lord  in his practice  however he may  have sneered at aristocracy in his writings  but if we put ourselves  as far as we can into the poet s place  we shall come to a much  more lenient conclusion  he could no doubt appreciate thoroughly the  advantages of a free republic or of a purely constitutional government   and would  of course  have preferred either of these for his country   but while theory pointed in that direction  facts were all pulling the  opposite way  the materials for the establishment of such a state of  things did not exist in a strong middle class or an equal balance of  parties  the choice lay between the anarchy of a continued strife of  selfish factions  and the concentration of power in the hands of some  individual who should be capable of enforcing law at home and commanding  respect abroad  so at least horace obviously thought  and surely it is  reasonable to suppose that the man  whose integrity and judgment in all  other matters are indisputable  was more likely than the acutest critic  or historian of modern times can possibly be to form a just estimate  of what was the possible best for his country  under the actual  circumstances of the time     had horace at once become the panegyrist of the caesar  the sincerity of  his convictions might have  been open to question  but thirteen years at  least had elapsed between the battle of philippi and the composition  of the second ode of the first book  which is the first direct  acknowledgment by horace of augustus as the chief of the state  this ode  is directly inspired by gratitude for the cessation of civil strife  and  the skilful administration which had brought things to the point when  the whole fighting force of the kingdom  which had so long been wasted  in that strife  could be directed to spreading the glory of the roman  name  and securing its supremacy throughout its conquered provinces   the allusions to augustus in this and others of the earlier odes are  somewhat cold and formal in their tone  there is a visible increase in  glow and energy in those of a later date  when  as years went on  the  caesar established fresh claims on the gratitude of rome by his firm   sagacious  and moderate policy  by the general prosperity which grew  up under his administration  by the success of his arms  by the great  public works which enhanced the splendour and convenience of the  capital  by the restoration of the laws  and by his zealous endeavour  to stem the tide of immorality which had set in during the protracted  disquietudes of the civil wars  it is true that during this time  augustus was also establishing the system of imperialism  which  contained in itself the germs of tyranny  with all its brutal excesses  on the one hand  and its debasing influence upon the subject nation on  the other  but we who have seen into what it developed must remember  that these baneful fruits of the system were of lengthened growth   and horace  who saw no farther into the future than the practical  politicians of his time  may be forgiven if he dwelt only upon the  immediate blessings which the government of augustus effected  and the  peace and security which came with a tenfold welcome after the long  agonies of the civil wars     the glow and sincerity of feeling of which we have spoken are  conspicuous in the following ode  iv      addressed to iulus antonius   the son of the triumvir  of whose powers as a poet nothing is known  beyond the implied recognition of them contained in this ode  the  sicambri  with two other german tribes  had crossed the rhine  laid  waste part of the roman territory in gaul  and inflicted so serious a  blow on lollius  the roman legate  that augustus himself repaired  to gaul to retrieve the defeat and resettle the province  this he  accomplished triumphantly  b c       and we may assume that the ode  was written while the tidings of his success were still fresh  and the  romans  who had been greatly agitated by the defeat of lollius  were  looking eagerly forward to his return  apart from  its other merits   the ode is interesting from the estimate horace makes in it of his own  powers  and his avowal of the labour which his verses cost him        iulus  he who d rival pindar s fame     on waxen wings doth sweep    the empyrean steep     to fall like icarus  and with his name    endue the glassy deep        like to a mountain stream  that roars    from bank to bank along     when autumn rains are strong     so deep mouthed pindar lifts his voice  and pours    his fierce tumultuous song        worthy apollo s laurel wreath     whether he strike the lyre    to love and young desire     while bold and lawless numbers grow beneath    his mastering touch of fire        or sings of gods  and monarchs sprung    of gods  that overthrew    the centaurs  hideous crew     and  fearless of the monster s fiery tongue     the dread chimaera slew        or those the elean palm doth lift    to heaven  for winged steed     or sturdy arm decreed     giving  than hundred statues nobler gift     the poet s deathless meed        or mourns the youth snatched from his bride     extols his manhood clear     and to the starry sphere    exalts his golden virtues  scattering wide    the gloom of orcus drear        when the dircean swan doth climb    into the azure sky     there poised in ether high     he courts each gale  and floats on wing sublime     soaring with steadfast eye        i  like the tiny bee  that sips    the fragrant thyme  and strays    humming through leafy ways     by tibur s sedgy banks  with trembling lips    fashion my toilsome lays        but thou  when up the sacred steep    caesar  with garlands crowned     leads the sicambrians bound     with bolder hand the echoing strings shalt sweep     and bolder measures sound        caesar  than whom a nobler son    the fates and heaven s kind powers    ne er gave this earth of ours     nor e er will give though backward time should run    to its first golden hours        thou too shalt sing the joyful days     the city s festive throng     when caesar  absent long     at length returns   the forum s silent ways     serene from strife and wrong        then  though in statelier power it lack     my voice shall swell the lay     and sing   oh  glorious day     oh  day thrice blest  that gives great caesar back    to rome  from hostile fray          io triumphe   thrice the cry      io triumphe   loud    shall shout the echoing crowd    the city through  and to the gods on high    raise incense like a cloud      ten bulls shall pay thy sacrifice   with whom ten kine shall bleed     i to the fane will lead    a yearling of the herd  of modest size     from the luxuriant mead        horned like the moon  when her pale light    which three brief days have fed     she trimmeth  and dispread    on his broad brows a spot of snowy white     all else a tawny red      augustus did not return from gaul  as was expected when this ode was  written  but remained there for about two years  that this protracted  absence caused no little disquietude in rome is apparent from the  following ode  iv              from gods benign descended  thou    best guardian of the fates of rome     too long already from thy home    hast thou  dear chief  been absent now        oh  then return  the pledge redeem     thou gav st the senate  and once more    its light to all the land restore     for when thy face  like spring tide s gleam        its brightness on the people sheds     then glides the day more sweetly by     a brighter blue pervades the sky     the sun a richer radiance spreads        as on her boy the mother calls     her boy  whom envious tempests keep    beyond the vexed carpathian deep     from his dear home  till winter falls        and still with vow and prayer she cries     still gazes on the winding shore     so yearns the country evermore    for caesar  with fond  wistful eyes        for safe the herds range field and fen     full headed stand the shocks of grain     our sailors sweep the peaceful main     and man can trust his fellow men        no more adulterers stain our beds     laws  morals  both that taint efface     the husband in the child we trace     and close on crime sure vengeance treads        the parthian  under caesar s reign     or icy scythian  who can dread     or all the tribes barbarian bred    by germany  or ruthless spain        now each man  basking on his slopes     weds to his widowed trees the vine     then  as he gaily quaffs his wine     salutes thee god of all his hopes        and prayers to thee devoutly sends     with deep libations  and  as greece    ranks castor and great hercules     thy godship with his lares blends        oh  may st thou on hesperia shine     her chief  her joy  for many a day     thus  dry lipped  thus at morn we pray     thus pray at eve  when flushed with wine       it was perhaps the policy of augustus   says macleane   to make his  absence felt  and we may believe that the language of horace   which bears much more the impress of real feeling than of flattery   represented the sentiments of great numbers at rome  who felt the want  of that presiding genius which had brought the city through its long  troubles  and given it comparative peace  there could not be a more  comprehensive picture of security and rest obtained through the  influence of one mind than is represented in this ode  if we except that  with which no merely mortal language can compare  isaiah  xi  and lxv    micah  iv       we must not assume  from the reference in this and other odes to the  divine origin of augustus  that this was seriously relieved in by  horace  any more than it was by augustus himself  popular credulity  ascribed divine honours to great men  and this was the natural growth  of a religious system in which a variety of gods and demigods played  so large a part  julius caesar claimed no doubt  for the purpose  of impressing the roman populace a direct descent from  alma venus  genitrix   as antony did from hercules  altars and temples were  dedicated to great statesmen and generals  and the romans  among the  other things which they borrowed from the east  borrowed also the  practice of conferring the honours of apotheosis upon their rulers   the  visible agents  in their estimation  of the great invisible power that  governed the world  to speak of their divine descent and attributes  became part of the common forms of the poetical vocabulary  not  inappropriate to the exalted pitch of lyrical enthusiasm  horace only  falls into the prevailing strain  and is not compromising himself by  servile flattery  as some have thought  when he speaks in this ode  of augustus as  from gods benign descended   and in others as  the  heaven sent son of maia   i      or as reclining among the gods and  quaffing nectar  with lip of deathless bloom   iii      in lyrical  poetry all this was quite in place  but when the poet contracts his  wings  and drops from its empyrean to the level of the earth  he speaks  to augustus and of him simply as he thought  epistles  ii      as a  man on whose shoulders the weight of empire rested  who protected the  commonwealth by the vigour of his armies  and strove to grace it by   sweeter manners  purer laws   he adds  it is true          you while in life are honoured as divine     and vows and oaths are taken at your shrine     so rome pays honour to her man of men     ne er seen on earth before  ne er to be seen again     c      but this is no more than a statement of a fact  altars were erected to  augustus  much against his will  and at these men made their prayers or  plighted their oaths every day  there is not a word to imply either that  augustus took these divine honours  or that horace joined in ascribing  them  seriously     it is of some importance to the argument in favour of horace s sincerity  and independence  that he had no selfish end to serve by standing well  with augustus  we have seen that he was more than content with the  moderate fortune secured to him by maecenas  wealth had no charms for  him  his ambition was to make his mark as a poet  his happiness lay in  being his own master  there is no trace of his having at any period been  swayed by other views  what then had he to gain by courting the favour  of the head of the state  but the argument goes further  when augustus  found the pressure of his private correspondence too great  as his  public duties increased  and his health  never robust  began to fail  he  offered horace the post of his private secretary  the poet declined on  the ground of health  he contrived to do so in such a way as to give no  umbrage by the refusal  nay  the letters which are quoted in the life of  horace ascribed to suetonius show that augustus begged the poet to treat  him on the same footing as if he had accepted the office  and actually  become a member of his household   our friend septimius   he says in  another letter   will tell you how much you are in my thoughts  for  something led to my speaking of you before him  neither  if you were too  proud to accept my friendship  do i mean to deal with you in the same  spirit   there could have been little of the courtier in the man who was  thus addressed  horace apparently felt that augustus and himself were  likely to be better friends at a distance  he had seen enough of court  life to know how perilous it is to that independence which was his  dearest possession    dulcis inexpertis cultura potentis amici  expertus  metuit    is his ultimate conviction on this head  epistles  i              till time has made us wise      tis sweet to wait    upon the smiles and favour of the great     but he that once has ventured that career    shrinks from its perils with instinctive fear      in another place  epistles  i      he says    fuge magna  licet sub  paupere tecto reges et regum vita praecurrere amicos            keep clear of courts  a homely life transcends    the vaunted bliss of monarchs and their friends     c      but apart from such considerations  life would have lost its charm for  horace  had he put himself within the trammels of official service  at  no time would these have been tolerable to him  but as he advanced into  middle age  the freedom of entire independence  the refreshing solitudes  of the country  leisure for study and reflection  became more and more  precious to him  the excitements and gaieties and social enjoyments of  rome were all very well  but a little of them went a great way  they  taxed his delicate health  and they interfered with the graver studies   to which he became daily more inclined as the years went by  not all his  regard for maecenas himself  deep as it was  could induce him to stay in  town to enliven the leisure hours of the statesman by his companionship  at the expense of those calm seasons of communion with nature and  the books of the great men of old  in which he could indulge his  irresistible craving for some solution of the great problems of life and  philosophy  men like maecenas  whose power and wealth are practically  unbounded  are apt to become importunate even in their friendships  and  to think that everything should give way to the gratification of their  wishes  something of this spirit had obviously been shown towards  horace  maecenas may have expressed himself in a tone of complaint   either to the poet himself  or in some way that had reached his ears   about his prolonged absence in the country  which implied that he  considered his bounties had given him a claim upon the time of horace  which was not sufficiently

originally black   adding that he is       in person small  one to whom warmth is life     in temper hasty  yet averse from strife      his health demanded constant care  and we find him writing  epistles  i       to a friend  to ask what sort of climate and people are to be  found at velia and salernum   the one a town of lucania  the other of  campania   as he has been ordered by his doctor to give up his favourite  watering place  baiae  as too relaxing  this doctor was antonius musa  a  great apostle of the cold water cure  by which he had saved the life  of augustus when in extreme danger  the remedy instantly became  fashionable  and continued so until the emperor s nephew  the young  marcellus  died under the treatment  horace s inquiries are just such as  a valetudinarian

 horace maintains  in his later as in his  early writings  a uniform cheerfulness  this never forsakes him  for  life is a boon for which he is ever grateful  the gods have allotted him  an ample share of the means of enjoyment  and it is his own fault if he  suffers self created worries or desires to vex him  by the questions he  puts to a friend in one of the latest of his epistles  ii

happiness may grow      next to a dear friend  they were horace s most cherished companions  not  for amusement merely  and the listless luxury of the self wrapt lounger   were they prized by him  but

restless desires and disquieting aspirations into subjection   and fortified himself in the bliss of contentment  he saw they were  letting the precious hours slip from their grasp   hours that might have  been so happy  but were so weighted with disquiet and weariness  and he  loved his friends too well to keep silence on this theme  we  like them   it has been admirably said   footnote  etude

horace  if he does not always  succeed with us  any more than with them  in curing us of these  he at  all events soothes and tranquillises us in the moments which we spend  with him  he augments  on the other hand  the happiness of those who are  already happy  and there is not one of us but feels under obligation to  him for his gentle and salutary lessons    verbaque et voces    for  his soothing or invigorating balsams  as much as though this gifted  physician of soul and body had compounded them specially for ourselves      when he published the first book of epistles he seems to have thought  the time come for him to write no more lyrics  epistles  i              so now i bid my idle songs adieu     and turn my thoughts to what is just and true    c      graver habits  and a growing fastidiousness of taste  were likely to  give rise to this feeling  but a poet can no more renounce his lyre than  a painter his palette  and his fine  secular hymn   and many of the odes  of the fourth book  which were written after this period  prove that   so far from suffering any decay in poetical power  he had even gained  in force of conception  and in that  curiosa felicitas   that exquisite  felicity of expression  which has been justly ascribed to him by  petronius  several years afterwards  when writing of the mania for  scribbling verse which had beset the romans  as if  like dogberry s  reading and writing  the faculty of writing poetry came by nature  he  alludes to his own sins in the same direction with a touch of his old  irony  epistles  ii              e en i

emphasis translates his words         but those who cannot write  and those who can     all rhyme  and scrawl  and scribble to a man      it was very well for horace to laugh at his own inability to abstain  from verse making  but  had he been ever so much inclined to silence   his friends would not have let him rest  some wanted an ode  some an  epode  some a satire  epistles  ii             three hungry guests for different dishes call     and how s one host to satisfy them all    c      and there was one friend  whose request it was not easy to deny  this  was augustus  ten years after the imperial power had been placed in his  hands  b c      he resolved to celebrate a great national festival in  honour of his own successful career  horace was called on to write  an ode  known in his works as  the secular hymn   to be sung upon the  occasion by twenty seven boys and twenty seven girls of noble birth    the ode   says macleane   was sung at the most solemn part of the  festival  while the emperor was in person offering sacrifice at the  second hour of the night  on the river side  upon three altars  attended  by the fifteen men who presided over religious affairs  the effect must  have been very beautiful  and no wonder if the impression on horace s  feelings was strong and lasting   he was obviously pleased at being  chosen for the task  and not without pride   a very just one   at the  way it was performed  in the ode  iv      which seems to have been a  kind of prelude to the  secular hymn   he anticipates that the virgins  who chanted it will on their marriage day be proud to recall the fact  that they had taken part in this oratorio under his baton          when the cyclical year brought its festival days     my voice led the hymn of thanksgiving and praise     so sweet  the immortals to hear it were fain     and  twas horace the poet who taught me the strain      it was probably at the suggestion of augustus  also  that he wrote the  magnificent fourth and fourteenth odes of the fourth book  these were  written  however  to celebrate great national victories  and were  pitched in the high key appropriate to the theme  but this was not  enough for augustus  he wanted something more homely and human  and  was envious of the friends to whom horace had addressed the charming  epistles of the first book  a copy of which the poet had sent to him  by the hands of a friend  epistles  i       but only to be given to the  caesar        if he be well  and in a happy mood     and ask to have them   be it understood      and so he wrote to horace  the letter is quoted by suetonius   look  you  i take it much amiss that none of your writings of this class are  addressed to me  are you afraid it will damage your reputation with  posterity to be thought to have been one of my intimates   such a  letter  had horace been a vain man or an indiscreet  might have misled  him into approaching augustus with the freedom he courted  but he fell  into no such error  there is perfect frankness throughout the whole of  the epistle  with which he met the emperor s request  ii      but the  social distance between them is maintained with an emphasis which it is  impossible not to feel  the epistle opens by skilfully insinuating that   if the poet has not before addressed the emperor  it is that he may not  be suspected of encroaching on the hours which were due to the higher  cares of state          since you  great caesar  singly wield the charge    of rome s concerns  so manifold and large       with sword and shield the commonwealth protect     with morals grace it  and with laws correct       the bard  methinks  would do a public wrong     who  having gained your ear  should keep it long    c      it is not while they live  he continues  that  in the ordinary case  the  worth of the great benefactors of mankind is recognised  only after  they are dead  do misunderstanding and malice give way to admiration and  love  rome  it is true  has been more just  it has appreciated  and it  avows  how much it owes to augustus  but the very same people who have  shown themselves wise and just in this are unable to extend the same  principle to living literary genius  a poet must have been long dead and  buried  or he is nought  the very flaws of old writers are cried up as  beauties by pedantic critics  while the highest excellence in a writer  of the day meets with no response        had greece but been as carping and as cold    to new productions  what would now be old     what standard works would there have been  to come    beneath the public eye  the public thumb    c      let us then look the facts fairly in the face  let us  clear our minds  of cant   if a poem be bad in itself  let us say so  no matter how old  or how famous it be  if it be good  let us be no less candid  though the  poet be still struggling into notice among us     thanks  he proceeds  to our happy times  men are now devoting themselves  to the arts of peace    graecia capta ferum victorem cepit     her  ruthless conqueror greece has overcome   the romans of the better class   who of old thought only of the triumphs of the forum  or of turning over  their money profitably  are now bitten by a literary furor        pert boys  prim fathers  dine in wreaths of bay     and  twixt the courses warble out the lay    c      but this craze is no unmixed evil  for  take him all in all  your poet  can scarcely be a bad fellow  pulse and second bread are a banquet  for him  he is sure not to be greedy or close fisted  for to him  as  tennyson in the same spirit says   mellow metres are more than ten per  cent   neither is he likely to cheat his partner or his ward  he may cut  a poor figure in a campaign  but he does the state good service at home        his lessons form the child s young lips  and wean    the boyish ear from words and tales unclean     as years roll on  he moulds the ripening mind     and makes it just and generous  sweet and kind     he tells of worthy precedents  displays    the examples of the past to after days     consoles affliction  and disease allays    c      horace then goes on to sketch the rise of poetry and the drama among the  romans  glancing  as he goes  at the perverted taste which was making  the stage the vehicle of mere spectacle  and intimating his own high  estimate of the dramatic writer in words which shakespeare seems to have  been meant to realise          that man i hold true master of his art     who with fictitious woes can wring my heart     can rouse me  soothe me  pierce me with the thrill    of vain alarm  and  as by magic skill     bear me to thebes  to athens  where you will    c      here  as elsewhere  horace treats dramatic writing as the very highest  exercise of poetic genius  and  in dwelling on it as he does  he  probably felt sure of carrying with him the fullest sympathies of  augustus  for among his varied literary essays  the emperor  like most  dilettanti  had tried his hand upon a tragedy  failing  however  to  satisfy himself  he had the rarer wisdom to suppress it  the story of  his play was that of ajax  and when asked one day how it was getting  on  he replied that his hero  had finished his career upon a  sponge      ajacem suum in spongio incubuisse       from the drama horace proceeds to speak of the more timid race of  bards  who   instead of being hissed and acted  would be read   and who   himself included  are apt to do themselves harm in various ways through  over sensitiveness or simplicity  thus  for example  they will intrude  their works on augustus  when he is busy or tired  or wince  poor  sensitive rogues  if a friend ventures to take exception to a verse  or  bore him by repeating  unasked  one or other of their pet passages   or by complaints that their happiest thoughts and most highly polished  turns escape unnoticed  or  worse folly than all  they will expect to  be sent for by augustus the moment he comes across their poems  and told   to starve no longer  and go writing on   yet  continues horace  it is  better the whole tribe should be disappointed  than that a great  man s glory should be dimmed  like alexander s  by being sung of by a  second rate poet  and wherefore should it be so  when augustus has at  command the genius of such men as virgil and varius  they  and they  only  are the fit laureates of the emperor s great achievements  and in  this way the poet returns  like a skilful composer  to the  motif  with  which he set out  distrust of his own powers  which has restrained   and must continue to restrain  him from pressing himself and his small  poetic powers upon the emperor s notice     in the other poems which belong to this period  the second epistle of  the second book  and the epistle to the pisos  generally known as the   ars poetica   horace confines himself almost exclusively to purely  literary topics  the dignity of literature was never better vindicated  than in these epistles  in horace s estimation it was a thing always to  be approached with reverence  mediocrity in it was intolerable  genius  is much  but genius without art will not win immortality   for a good  poet s made  as well as born   there must be a working up to the highest  models  a resolute intolerance of anything slight or slovenly  a fixed  purpose to put what the writer has to express into forms at once the  most beautiful  suggestive  and compact  the mere trick of literary  composition horace holds exceedingly cheap  brilliant nonsense finds  no allowance from him  truth  truth in feeling and in thought  must be  present  if the work is to have any value    scribendi recte sapere est  et principium et fons            of writing well  be sure the secret lies    in wisdom  therefore study to be wise    c      whatever the form of composition  heroic  didactic  lyric  or dramatic   it must be pervaded by unity of feeling and design  and no style is  good  or illustration endurable  which  either overlays or does not  harmonise with the subject in hand     the epistle to the pisos does not profess to be a complete exposition of  the poet s art  it glances only at small sections of that wide theme   so far as it goes  it is all gold  full of most instructive hints for a  sound critical taste and a pure literary style  it was probably meant to  cure the younger piso of that passion for writing verse which had  as we  have seen  spread like a plague among the romans  and which made a  visit to the public baths a penance to critical ears   for there the  poetasters were always sure of an audience   and added new terrors  to the already sufficiently formidable horrors of the roman banquet    footnote  this theory has been worked out with great ability by  the late m  a  baron  in his  epitre d horace aux pisons sur l art  poetique   bruxelles        which is accompanied by a masterly  translation and notes of great value   when we find an experienced  critic like horace urging young piso  as he does  to keep what he writes  by him for nine years  the conclusion is irresistible  that he hoped  by that time the writer would see the wisdom of suppressing his crude  lucubrations altogether  no one knew better than horace that first class  work never wants such protracted mellowing     soon  after this poem was written the great palace on the esquiline lost  its master  he died  b c     in the middle of the year  bequeathing his  poet friend to the care of augustus in the words   horati flacci  ut  mei  esto memor      bear horace in your memory as you would myself    but the legacy was not long upon the emperor s hands  seventeen years  before  horace had written        think not that i have sworn a bootless oath       yes  we shall go  shall go     hand linked in hand  where er thou leadest  both      the last sad road below      the lines must have rung in the poet s ears like a sad refrain  the  digentia lost its charm  he could not see its crystal waters for the  shadows of charon s rueful stream  the prattle of his loved bandusian  spring could not wean his thoughts from the vision of his other self  wandering unaccompanied along that  last sad road   we may fancy that  horace was thenceforth little seen in his accustomed haunts  he who had  so often soothed the sorrows of other bereaved hearts  answered with a  wistful smile to the friendly consolations of the many that loved him   his work was done  it was time to go away  not all the skill of orpheus  could recall him whom he had lost  the welcome end came sharply and  suddenly  and one day  when  the bleak november wind was whirling down  the oak leaves on his well loved brook  the servants of his sabine  farm heard that they should no more see the good  cheery master  whose  pleasant smile and kindly word had so often made their labours light   there was many a sad heart  too  we may be sure  in rome  when the  wit who never wounded  the poet who ever charmed  the friend who never  failed  was laid in a corner of the esquiline  close to the tomb of his   dear knight maecenas   he died on the   th november b c     the kindly   lonely man  leaving to augustus what little he possessed  one would fain  trust his own words were inscribed upon his tomb  as in the supreme hour  the faith they expressed was of a
