mining region  in any region for that matter   is it not  so   a crowded police court docket is the surest of all signs that trade  is brisk and money plenty   still  there is one other sign  it comes  last  but when it does come it establishes beyond cavil that the  flush  times  are at the flood   this is the birth of the  literary  paper   the weekly occidental   devoted to literature   made its appearance in  virginia   all the literary people were engaged to write for it   mr  f   was to edit it   he was a felicitous skirmisher with a pen  and a man who  could say happy things in a crisp  neat way   once  while editor of the  union  he had disposed of a labored  incoherent  two column attack made  upon him by a contemporary  with a single line  which  at first glance   seemed to contain a solemn and tremendous compliment  viz    the logic of  our adversary resembles the peace of god    and left it to the reader s  memory and after thought to invest the remark with another and  more  different  meaning by supplying for himself and at his own leisure the  rest of the scripture   in that it passeth understanding    he once said  of a little  half starved  wayside community that had no subsistence  except what they could get by preying upon chance passengers who stopped  over with them a day when traveling by the overland stage  that in their  church service they had altered the lord s prayer to read   give us this  day our daily stranger      we expected great things of the occidental   of course it could not get  along without an original novel  and so we made arrangements to hurl into  the work the full strength of the company   mrs  f  was an able romancist  of the ineffable school  i know no other name to apply to a school whose  heroes are all dainty and all perfect   she wrote the opening chapter   and introduced a lovely blonde simpleton who talked nothing but pearls  and poetry and who was virtuous to the verge of eccentricity   she also  introduced a young french duke of aggravated refinement  in love with the  blonde   mr  f  followed next week  with a brilliant lawyer who set about  getting the duke s estates into trouble  and a sparkling young lady of  high society who fell to fascinating the duke and impairing the appetite  of the blonde   mr  d   a dark and bloody editor of one of the dailies   followed mr  f   the third  week  introducing a mysterious roscicrucian  who transmuted metals  held consultations with the devil in a cave at  dead of night  and cast the horoscope of the several heroes and heroines  in such a way as to provide plenty of trouble for their future careers  and breed a solemn and awful public interest in the novel   he also  introduced a cloaked and masked melodramatic miscreant  put him on a  salary and set him on the midnight track of the duke with a poisoned  dagger   he also created an irish coachman with a rich brogue and placed  him in the service of the society young lady with an ulterior mission to  carry billet doux to the duke     about this time there arrived in virginia a dissolute stranger with a  literary turn of mind  rather seedy he was  but very quiet and  unassuming  almost diffident  indeed   he was so gentle  and his manners  were so pleasing and kindly  whether he was sober or intoxicated  that he  made friends of all who came in contact with him   he applied for  literary work  offered conclusive evidence that he wielded an easy and  practiced pen  and so mr  f  engaged him at once to help write the novel   his chapter was to follow mr  d  s  and mine was to come next   now what  does this fellow do but go off and get drunk and then proceed to his  quarters and set to work with his imagination in a state of chaos  and  that chaos in a condition of extravagant activity   the result may be  guessed   he scanned the chapters of his predecessors  found plenty of  heroes and heroines already created  and was satisfied with them  he  decided to introduce no more  with all the confidence that whisky  inspires and all the easy complacency it gives to its servant  he then  launched himself lovingly into his work  he married the coachman to the  society young lady for the sake of the scandal  married the duke to the  blonde s stepmother  for the sake of the sensation  stopped the  desperado s salary  created a misunderstanding between the devil and the  roscicrucian  threw the duke s property into the wicked lawyer s hands   made the lawyer s upbraiding conscience drive him to drink  thence to  delirium tremens  thence to suicide  broke the coachman s neck  let his  widow succumb to contumely  neglect  poverty and consumption  caused the  blonde to drown herself  leaving her clothes on the bank with the  customary note pinned to them forgiving the duke and hoping he would be  happy  revealed to the duke  by means of the usual strawberry mark on  left arm  that he had married his own long lost mother and destroyed his  long lost sister  instituted the proper and necessary suicide of the duke  and the duchess in order to compass poetical justice  opened the earth  and let the roscicrucian through  accompanied with the accustomed smoke  and thunder and smell of brimstone  and finished with the promise that in  the next chapter  after holding a general inquest  he would take up the  surviving character of the novel and tell what became of the devil   it read with singular smoothness  and with a  dead  earnestness that was  funny enough to suffocate a body   but there was war when it came in   the other novelists were furious   the mild stranger  not yet more than  half sober  stood there  under a scathing fire of vituperation  meek and  bewildered  looking from one to another of his assailants  and wondering  what he could have done to invoke such a storm   when a lull came at  last  he said his say gently and appealingly  said he did not rightly  remember what he had written  but was sure he had tried to do the best he  could  and knew his object had been to make the novel not only pleasant  and plausible but instructive and        the bombardment began again   the novelists assailed his ill chosen  adjectives and demolished them with a storm of denunciation and ridicule   and so the siege went on   every time the stranger tried to appease the  enemy he only made matters worse   finally he offered to rewrite the  chapter   this arrested hostilities   the indignation gradually quieted  down  peace reigned again and the sufferer retired in safety and got him  to his own citadel     but on the way thither the evil angel tempted him and he got drunk again   and again his imagination went mad   he led the heroes and heroines a  wilder dance than ever  and yet all through it ran that same convincing  air of honesty and earnestness that had marked his first work   he got  the characters into the most extraordinary situations  put them through  the most surprising performances  and made them talk the strangest talk   but the chapter cannot be described   it was symmetrically crazy  it was  artistically absurd  and it had explanatory footnotes that were fully as  curious as the text   i remember one of the  situations   and will offer  it as an example of the whole   he altered the character of the brilliant  lawyer  and made him a great hearted  splendid fellow  gave him fame and  riches  and set his age at thirty three years   then he made the blonde  discover  through the help of the roscicrucian and the melodramatic  miscreant  that while the duke loved her money ardently and wanted it  he  secretly felt a sort of leaning toward the society young lady   stung to  the quick  she tore her affections from him and bestowed them with  tenfold power upon the lawyer  who responded with consuming zeal   but  the parents would none of it   what they wanted in the family was a duke   and a duke they were determined to have  though they confessed that next  to the duke the lawyer had their preference   necessarily the blonde now  went into a decline   the parents were alarmed   they pleaded with her to  marry the duke  but she steadfastly refused  and pined on   then they  laid a plan   they told her to wait a year and a day  and if at the end  of that time she still felt that she could not marry the duke  she might  marry the lawyer with their full consent   the result was as they had  foreseen  gladness came again  and the flush of returning health   then  the parents took the next step in their scheme   they had the family  physician recommend a long sea voyage and much land travel for the  thorough restoration of the blonde s strength  and they invited the duke  to be of the party   they judged that the duke s constant presence and  the lawyer s protracted absence would do the rest  for they did not  invite the lawyer     so they set sail in a steamer for america  and the third day out  when  their sea sickness called truce and permitted them to take their first  meal at the public table  behold there sat the lawyer   the duke and  party made the best of an awkward situation  the voyage progressed  and  the vessel neared america     but  by and by  two hundred miles off new bedford  the ship took fire   she burned to the water s edge  of all her crew and passengers  only  thirty were saved   they floated about the sea half an afternoon and all  night long   among them were our friends   the lawyer  by superhuman  exertions  had saved the blonde and her parents  swimming back and forth  two hundred yards and bringing one each time   the girl first    the duke  had saved himself   in the morning two whale ships arrived on the scene  and sent their boats   the weather was stormy and the embarkation was  attended with much confusion and excitement   the lawyer did his duty  like a man  helped his exhausted and insensible blonde  her parents and  some others into a boat  the duke helped himself in   then a child fell  overboard at the other end of the raft and the lawyer rushed thither and  helped half a dozen people fish it out  under the stimulus of its  mother s screams   then he ran back  a few seconds too late  the blonde s  boat was under way   so he had to take the other boat  and go to the  other ship   the storm increased and drove the vessels out of sight of  each other  drove them whither it would     when it calmed  at the end of three days  the blonde s ship was seven  hundred miles north of boston and the other about seven hundred south of  that port   the blonde s captain was bound on a whaling cruise in the  north atlantic and could not go back such a distance or make a port  without orders  such being nautical law   the lawyer s captain was to  cruise in the north pacific  and he could not go back or make a port  without orders   all the lawyer s money and baggage were in the blonde s  boat and went to the blonde s ship  so his captain made him work his  passage as a common sailor   when both ships had been cruising nearly a  year  the one was off the coast of greenland and the other in behring s  strait   the blonde had long ago been well nigh persuaded that her lawyer  had been washed overboard and lost just before the whale ships reached  the raft  and now  under the pleadings of her parents and the duke she  was at last beginning to nerve herself for the doom of the covenant  and  prepare for the hated marriage     but she would not yield a day before the date set   the weeks dragged on   the time narrowed  orders were given to deck the ship for the wedding  a  wedding at sea among icebergs and walruses   five days more and all would  be over   so the blonde reflected  with a sigh and a tear   oh where was  her true love  and why  why did he not come and save her   at that moment  he was lifting his harpoon to strike a whale in behring s strait  five  thousand miles away  by the way of the arctic ocean  or twenty thousand  by the way of the horn  that was the reason   he struck  but not with  perfect aim  his foot slipped and he fell in the whale s mouth and went  down his throat   he was insensible five days   then he came to himself  and heard voices  daylight was streaming through a hole cut in the  whale s roof   he climbed out and astonished the sailors who were  hoisting blubber up a ship s side   he recognized the vessel  flew  aboard  surprised the wedding party at the altar and exclaimed      stop the proceedings  i m here   come to my arms  my own      there were foot notes to this extravagant piece of literature wherein the  author endeavored to show that the whole thing was within the  possibilities  he said he got the incident of the whale traveling from  behring s strait to the coast of greenland  five thousand miles in five  days  through the arctic ocean  from charles reade s  love me little love  me long   and considered that that established the fact that the thing  could be done  and he instanced jonah s adventure as proof that a man  could live in a whale s belly  and added that if a preacher could stand  it three days a lawyer could surely stand it five     there was a fiercer storm than ever in the editorial sanctum now  and the  stranger was peremptorily discharged  and his manuscript flung at his  head   but he had already delayed things so much that there was not time  for some one else to rewrite the chapter  and so the paper came out  without any novel in it   it was but a feeble  struggling  stupid  journal  and the absence of the novel probably shook public confidence   at any rate  before the first side of the next issue went to press  the  weekly occidental died as peacefully as an infant     an effort was made to resurrect it  with the proposed advantage of a  telling new title  and mr  f  said that the phenix would be just the name  for it  because it would give the idea of a resurrection from its dead  ashes in a new and undreamed of condition of splendor  but some  low priced smarty on one of the dailies suggested that we call it the  lazarus  and inasmuch as the people were not profound in scriptural  matters but thought the resurrected lazarus and the dilapidated mendicant  that begged in the rich man s gateway were one and the same person  the  name became the laughing stock of the town  and killed the paper for good  and all     i was sorry enough  for i was very proud of being connected with a  literary paper  prouder than i have ever been of anything since  perhaps   i had written some rhymes for it  poetry i considered it  and it was a  great grief to me that the production was on the  first side  of the  issue that was not completed  and hence did not see the light   but time  brings its revenges  i can put it in here  it will answer in place of a  tear dropped to the memory of the lost occidental   the idea  not the  chief idea  but the vehicle that bears it  was probably suggested by the  old song called  the raging canal   but i cannot remember now   i do  remember  though  that at that time i thought my doggerel was one of the  ablest poems of the age       the aged pilot man     on the erie canal  it was   all on a summer s day   i sailed forth with my parents  far away to albany     from out the clouds at noon that day  there came a dreadful storm   that piled the billows high about   and filled us with alarm     a man came rushing from a house   saying   snub up your boat i pray    the customary canal technicality for  tie up     snub up your boat  snub up  alas   snub up while yet you may      our captain cast one glance astern   then forward glanced he   and said   my wife and little ones  i never more shall see      said dollinger the pilot man   in noble words  but few      fear not  but lean on dollinger   and he will fetch you through      the boat drove on  the frightened mules  tore through the rain and wind   and bravely still  in danger s post   the whip boy strode behind      come  board  come  board   the captain cried    nor tempt so wild a storm    but still the raging mules advanced   and still the boy strode on     then said the captain to us all    alas   tis plain to me   the greater danger is not there   but here upon the sea      so let us strive  while life remains   to save all souls on board   and then if die at last we must   let             i cannot speak the word      said dollinger the pilot man   tow ring above the crew    fear not  but trust in dollinger   and he will fetch you through       low bridge   low bridge   all heads went down   the laboring bark sped on   a mill we passed  we passed church   hamlets  and fields of corn   and all the world came out to see   and chased along the shore  crying   alas  alas  the sheeted rain   the wind  the tempest s roar   alas  the gallant ship and crew   can nothing help them more      and from our deck sad eyes looked out  across the stormy scene   the tossing wake of billows aft   the bending forests green   the chickens sheltered under carts  in lee of barn the cows   the skurrying swine with straw in mouth   the wild spray from our bows      she balances   she wavers   now let her go about   if she misses stays and broaches to   we re all   then with a shout    huray   huray   avast   belay   take in more sail   lord  what a gale   ho  boy  haul taut on the hind mule s tail     ho

retreat      said dollinger  the pilot man   as on the vessel flew    fear not  but trust in dollinger   and he will fetch you through      a panic struck the bravest hearts   the boldest cheek turned pale   for plain to all  this shoaling said  a leak had burst the ditch s bed   and  straight as bolt from crossbow sped   our ship swept on  with shoaling lead   before the fearful gale      sever the tow line   cripple the mules    too late   there comes a shock   another length  and the fated craft  would have swum in the saving lock     then gathered together the shipwrecked crew  and took one last embrace   while sorrowful tears from despairing eyes  ran down each hopeless face   and some did think of their little ones  whom they never more might see   and others of waiting wives at home   and mothers that grieved would be     but of all the children of misery there  on that poor sinking frame   but one spake words of hope and faith   and i worshipped as they came   said dollinger the pilot man      o brave heart  strong and true       fear not  but trust in dollinger   for he will fetch you through      lo   scarce the words have passed his lips  the dauntless

i never yet saw such a storm   or one t with it began      so overboard a keg of nails  and anvils three we threw   likewise four bales of gunny sacks   two hundred pounds of glue   two sacks of corn

retired     then every sufferer stood amazed  that pilot man before   a moment stood   then wondering turned   and speechless walked ashore           chapter lii     since i desire  in this chapter  to say an instructive word or two about  the silver mines  the reader may take this fair warning and skip  if he  chooses   the year      was perhaps the very top blossom and culmination  of the  flush times    virginia swarmed with men and vehicles to that  degree that the place looked like a very hive  that is when one s vision  could pierce through the thick fog of alkali dust that was generally  blowing in summer   i will say  concerning this dust  that if you drove  ten miles through it  you and your horses would be coated with it a  sixteenth of an inch thick and present an outside appearance that was a  uniform pale yellow color  and your buggy would have three inches of dust  in it  thrown there by the wheels   the delicate scales used by the  assayers were inclosed in glass cases intended to be air tight  and yet  some of this dust was so impalpable and so invisibly fine that it would  get in  somehow  and impair the accuracy of those scales     speculation ran riot  and yet there was a world of substantial business  going on  too   all freights were brought over the mountains from  california      miles  by pack train partly  and partly in huge wagons  drawn by such long mule teams that each team amounted to a procession   and it did seem  sometimes  that the grand combined procession of animals  stretched unbroken from virginia to california   its long route was  traceable clear across the deserts of the territory by the writhing  serpent of dust it lifted up   by these wagons  freights over that  hundred and fifty miles were      a ton for small lots  same price for  all express matter brought by stage   and      a ton for full loads   one virginia firm received one hundred tons of freight a month  and paid          a month freightage   in the winter the freights were much higher   all the bullion was shipped in bars by stage to san francisco  a bar was  usually about twice the size of a pig of lead and contained from         to        according to the amount of gold mixed with the silver   and the  freight on it  when the shipment was large  was one and a quarter per  cent  of its intrinsic value     so  the freight on these bars probably averaged something more than      each   small shippers paid two per cent   there were three stages a day   each way  and i have seen the out going stages carry away a third of a  ton of bullion each  and more than once i saw them divide a two ton lot  and take it off   however  these were extraordinary events    mr  valentine  wells fargo s agent  has handled all the bullion shipped  through the virginia office for many a month   to his memory  which is  excellent  we are indebted for the following exhibit of the company s  business in the virginia office since the first of january        from  january  st to april  st  about          worth of bullion passed through  that office  during the next quarter            next quarter             next quarter            next quarter              and for the quarter  ending on the   th of last june  about              thus in a year and a  half  the virginia office only shipped            in bullion   during the  year      they shipped             so we perceive the average shipments  have more than doubled in the last six months   this gives us room to  promise for the virginia office          a month for the year        though perhaps  judging by the steady increase in the business  we are  under estimating  somewhat    this gives us            for the year   gold hill and silver city together can beat us  we will give them                to dayton  empire city  ophir and carson city  we will  allow an aggregate of             which is not over the mark  perhaps   and may possibly be a little under it   to esmeralda we give              to reese river and humboldt             which is liberal now  but may not  be before the year is out   so we prognosticate that the yield of bullion  this year will be about               placing the number of mills in the  territory at one hundred  this gives to each the labor of producing           in bullion during the twelve months   allowing them to run three  hundred days in the year  which none of them more than do   this makes  their work average        a day   say the mills average twenty tons of  rock a day and this rock worth     as a general thing  and you have the  actual work of our one hundred mills figured down  to a spot          a  day each  and             a year in the aggregate   enterprise    a considerable over estimate  m   t       two tons of silver bullion would be in the neighborhood of forty bars   and the freight on it over          each coach always carried a deal of  ordinary express matter beside  and also from fifteen to twenty  passengers at from     to     a head   with six stages going all the  time  wells  fargo and co  s virginia city business was important and  lucrative     all along under the centre of virginia and gold hill  for a couple of  miles  ran the great comstock silver lode  a vein of ore from fifty to  eighty feet thick between its solid walls of rock  a vein as wide as some  of new york s streets   i will remind the reader that in pennsylvania a  coal vein only eight feet wide is considered ample     virginia was a busy city of streets and houses above ground   under it  was another busy city  down in the bowels of the earth  where a great  population of men thronged in and out among an intricate maze of tunnels  and drifts  flitting hither and thither under a winking sparkle of  lights  and over their heads towered a vast web of interlocking timbers  that held the walls of the gutted comstock apart   these timbers were as  large as a man s body  and the framework stretched upward so far that no  eye could pierce to its top through the closing gloom   it was like  peering up through the clean picked ribs and bones of some colossal  skeleton   imagine such a framework two miles long  sixty feet wide  and  higher than any church spire in america   imagine this stately  lattice work stretching down broadway  from the st  nicholas to wall  street  and a fourth of july procession  reduced to pigmies  parading on  top of it and flaunting their flags  high above the pinnacle of trinity  steeple  one can imagine that  but he cannot well imagine what that  forest of timbers cost  from the time they were felled in the pineries  beyond washoe lake  hauled up and around mount davidson at atrocious  rates of freightage  then squared  let down into the deep maw of the mine  and built up there   twenty ample fortunes would not timber one of the  greatest of those silver mines   the spanish proverb says it requires a  gold mine to  run  a silver one  and it is true   a beggar with a silver  mine is a pitiable pauper indeed if he cannot sell     i spoke of the underground virginia as a city   the gould and curry is  only one single mine under there  among a great many others  yet the  gould and curry s streets of dismal drifts and tunnels were five miles in  extent  altogether  and its population five hundred miners   taken as a  whole  the underground city had some thirty miles of streets and a  population of five or six thousand   in this present day some of those  populations are at work from twelve to sixteen hundred feet under  virginia and gold hill  and the signal bells that tell them what the  superintendent above ground desires them to do are struck by telegraph as  we strike a fire alarm   sometimes men fall down a shaft  there  a  thousand feet deep   in such cases  the usual plan is to hold an inquest     if you wish to visit one of those mines  you may walk through a tunnel  about half a mile long if you prefer it  or you may take the quicker plan  of shooting like a dart down a shaft  on a small platform   it is like  tumbling down through an empty steeple  feet first   when you reach the  bottom  you take a candle and tramp through drifts and tunnels where  throngs of men are digging and blasting  you watch them send up tubs full  of great lumps of stone  silver ore  you select choice specimens from the  mass  as souvenirs  you admire the world of skeleton timbering  you  reflect frequently that you are buried under a mountain  a thousand feet  below daylight  being in the bottom of the mine you climb from  gallery   to  gallery   up endless ladders that stand straight up and down  when  your legs fail you at last  you lie down in a small box car in a cramped   incline  like a half up ended sewer and are dragged up to daylight  feeling as if you are crawling through a coffin that has no end to it   arrived at the top  you find a busy crowd of men receiving the ascending  cars and tubs and dumping the ore from an elevation into long rows of  bins capable of holding half a dozen tons each  under the bins are rows  of wagons loading from chutes and trap doors in the bins  and down the  long street is a procession of these wagons wending toward the silver  mills with their rich freight   it is all  done   now  and there you are   you need never go down again  for you have seen it all   if you have  forgotten the process of reducing the ore in the mill and making the  silver bars  you can go back and find it again in my esmeralda chapters  if so disposed     of course these mines cave in  in places  occasionally  and then it is  worth one s while to take the risk of descending into them and observing  the crushing power exerted by the pressing weight of a settling mountain   i published such an experience in the enterprise  once  and from it i  will take an extract           an hour in the caved mines   we journeyed down into the ophir mine         yesterday  to see the earthquake   we could not go down the deep        incline  because it still has a propensity to cave in places         therefore we traveled through the long tunnel which enters the hill        above the ophir office  and then by means of a series of long        ladders  climbed away down from the first to the fourth gallery         traversing a drift  we came to the spanish line  passed five sets of        timbers still uninjured  and found the earthquake   here was as        complete a chaos as ever was seen  vast masses of earth and        splintered and broken timbers piled confusedly together  with        scarcely an aperture left large enough for a cat to creep through         rubbish was still falling at intervals from above  and one timber        which had braced others earlier in the day  was now crushed down out        of its former position  showing that the caving and settling of the        tremendous mass was still going on   we were in that portion of the        ophir known as the  north mines    returning to the surface  we        entered a tunnel leading into the central  for the purpose of        getting into the main ophir   descending a long incline in this        tunnel  we traversed a drift or so  and then went down a deep shaft        from whence we proceeded into the fifth gallery of the ophir   from        a side drift we crawled through a small hole and got into the midst        of the earthquake again  earth and broken timbers mingled together        without regard to grace or symmetry   a large portion of the second         third and fourth galleries had caved in and gone to destruction  the        two latter at seven o clock on the previous evening           at the turn table  near the northern extremity of the fifth gallery         two big piles of rubbish had forced their way through from the fifth        gallery  and from the looks of the timbers  more was about to come         these beams are solid  eighteen inches square  first  a great beam        is laid on the floor  then upright ones  five feet high  stand on        it  supporting another horizontal beam  and so on  square above        square  like the framework of a window   the superincumbent weight        was sufficient to mash the ends of those great upright beams fairly        into the solid wood of the horizontal ones three inches  compressing        and bending the upright beam till it curved like a bow   before the        spanish caved in  some of their twelve inch horizontal timbers were        compressed in this way until they were only five inches thick         imagine the power it must take to squeeze a solid log together in        that way   here  also  was a range of timbers  for a distance of        twenty feet  tilted six inches out of the perpendicular by the        weight resting upon them from the caved galleries above   you could        hear things cracking and giving way  and it was not pleasant to know        that the world overhead was slowly and silently sinking down upon        you   the men down in the mine do not mind it  however           returning along the fifth gallery  we struck the safe part of the        ophir incline  and went down it to the sixth  but we found ten        inches of water there  and had to come back   in repairing the        damage done to the incline  the pump had to be stopped for two        hours  and in the meantime the water gained about a foot   however         the pump was at work again  and the flood water was decreasing         we climbed up to the fifth gallery again and sought a deep shaft         whereby we might descend to another part of the sixth  out of reach        of the water  but suffered disappointment  as the men had gone to        dinner  and there was no one to man the windlass   so  having seen        the earthquake  we climbed out at the union incline and tunnel  and        adjourned  all dripping with candle grease and perspiration  to        lunch at the ophir office           during the great flush year of       nevada  claims to have         produced             in bullion  almost  if not quite  a round        million to each thousand inhabitants  which is very well         considering that she was without agriculture and manufactures         silver mining was her sole productive industry   since the above was        in type  i learn from an official source that the above figure is        too high  and that the yield for      did not exceed                      however  the day for large figures is approaching  the sutro tunnel        is to plow through the comstock lode from end to end  at a depth of        two thousand feet  and then mining will be easy and comparatively        inexpensive  and the momentous matters of drainage  and hoisting and        hauling of ore will cease to be burdensome   this vast work will        absorb many years  and millions of dollars  in its completion  but        it will early yield money  for that desirable epoch will begin as        soon as it strikes the first end of the vein   the tunnel will be        some eight miles long  and will develop astonishing riches   cars        will carry the ore through the tunnel and dump it in the mills and        thus do away with the present costly system of double handling and        transportation by mule teams   the water from the tunnel will        furnish the motive power for the mills   mr  sutro  the originator        of this prodigious enterprise  is one of the few men in the world        who is gifted with the pluck and perseverance necessary to follow up        and hound such an undertaking to its completion   he has converted        several obstinate congresses to a deserved friendliness toward his        important work  and has gone up and down and to and fro in europe        until he has enlisted a great moneyed interest in it there           chapter liii     every now and then  in these days  the boys used to tell me i ought to  get one jim blaine to tell me the stirring story of his grandfather s old  ram  but they always added that i must not mention the matter unless jim  was drunk at the time  just comfortably and sociably drunk   they kept  this up until my curiosity was on the rack to hear the story   i got to  haunting blaine  but it was of no use  the boys always found fault with  his condition  he was often moderately but never satisfactorily drunk   i never watched a man s condition with such absorbing interest  such  anxious solicitude  i never so pined to see a man uncompromisingly drunk  before   at last  one evening i hurried to his cabin  for i learned that  this time his situation was such that even the most fastidious could find  no fault with it  he was tranquilly  serenely  symmetrically drunk  not a  hiccup to mar his voice  not a cloud upon his brain thick enough to  obscure his memory   as i entered  he was sitting upon an empty  powder keg  with a clay pipe in one hand and the other raised to command  silence   his face was round  red  and very serious  his throat was bare  and his hair tumbled  in general appearance and costume he was a stalwart  miner of the period   on the pine table stood a candle  and its dim light  revealed  the boys  sitting here and there on bunks  candle boxes   powder kegs  etc   they said      sh     don t speak  he s going to commence                        the story of the old ram     i found a seat at once  and blaine said      i don t reckon them times will ever come again   there never was a more  bullier old ram than what he was   grandfather fetched him from illinois    got him of a man by the name of yates  bill yates  maybe you might have  heard of him  his father was a deacon  baptist  and he was a rustler   too  a man had to get up ruther early to get the start of old thankful  yates  it was him that put the greens up to jining teams with my  grandfather when he moved west      seth green was prob ly the pick of the flock  he married a wilkerson    sarah wilkerson  good cretur  she was  one of the likeliest heifers that  was ever raised in old stoddard  everybody said that knowed her   she  could heft a bar l of flour as easy as i can flirt a flapjack   and spin   don t mention it   independent   humph   when sile hawkins come a  browsing around her  she let him know that for all his tin he couldn t  trot in harness alongside of her   you see  sile hawkins was  no  it  warn t sile hawkins  after all  it was a galoot by the name of filkins    i disremember his first name  but he was a stump  come into pra r meeting  drunk  one night  hooraying for nixon  becuz he thought it was a primary   and old deacon ferguson up and scooted him through the window and he lit  on old miss jefferson s head  poor old filly   she was a good soul  had a  glass eye and used to lend it to old miss wagner  that hadn t any  to  receive company in  it warn t big enough  and when miss wagner warn t  noticing  it would get twisted around in the socket  and look up  maybe   or out to one side  and every which way  while t  other one was looking  as straight ahead as a spy glass      grown people didn t mind it  but it most always made the children cry  it  was so sort of scary   she tried packing it in raw cotton  but it  wouldn t work  somehow  the cotton would get loose and stick out and look  so kind of awful that the children couldn t stand it no way   she was  always dropping it out  and turning up her old dead light on the company  empty  and making them oncomfortable  becuz she never could tell when it  hopped out  being blind on that side  you see   so somebody would have to  hunch her and say   your game eye has fetched loose   miss wagner dear     and then all of them would have to sit and wait till she jammed it in  again  wrong side before  as a general thing  and green as a bird s egg   being a bashful cretur and easy sot back before company   but being wrong  side before warn t much difference  anyway  becuz her own eye was  sky blue and the glass one was yaller on the front side  so whichever way  she turned it it didn t match nohow      old miss wagner was considerable on the borrow  she was   when she had a  quilting  or dorcas s iety at her house she gen ally borrowed miss  higgins s wooden leg to stump around on  it was considerable shorter than  her other pin  but much she minded that   she said she couldn t abide  crutches when she had company  becuz they were so slow  said when she had  company and things had to be done  she wanted to get up and hump herself   she was as bald as a jug  and so she used to borrow miss jacops s wig    miss jacops was the coffin peddler s wife  a ratty old buzzard  he was   that used to go roosting around where people was sick  waiting for  em   and there that old rip would sit all day  in the shade  on a coffin that  he judged would fit the can idate  and if it was a slow customer and kind  of uncertain  he d fetch his rations and a blanket along and sleep in the  coffin nights   he was anchored out that way  in frosty weather  for  about three weeks  once  before old robbins s place  waiting for him  and  after that  for as much as two years  jacops was not on speaking terms  with the old man  on account of his disapp inting him   he got one of his  feet froze  and lost money  too  becuz old robbins took a favorable turn  and got well   the next time robbins got sick  jacops tried to make up  with him  and varnished up the same old coffin and fetched it along  but  old robbins was too many for him  he had him in  and  peared to be  powerful weak  he bought the coffin for ten dollars and jacops was to pay  it back and twenty five more besides if robbins didn t like the coffin  after he d tried it   and then robbins died  and at the funeral he  bursted off the lid and riz up in his shroud and told the parson to let  up on the performances  becuz he could not stand such a coffin as that   you see he had been in a trance once before  when he was young  and he  took the chances on another  cal lating that if he made the trip it was  money in his pocket  and if he missed fire he couldn t lose a cent   and  by george he sued jacops for the rhino and got jedgment  and he set up  the coffin in his back parlor and said he  lowed to take his time  now   it was always an aggravation to jacops  the way that miserable old thing  acted   he moved back to indiany pretty soon  went to wellsville    wellsville was the place the hogadorns was from   mighty fine family   old maryland stock   old squire hogadorn could carry around more mixed  licker  and cuss better than most any man i ever see   his second wife  was the widder billings  she that was becky martin  her dam was deacon  dunlap s first wife   her oldest child  maria  married a missionary and  died in grace  et up by the savages   they et him  too  poor feller    biled him   it warn t the custom  so they say  but they explained to  friends of his n that went down there to bring away his things  that  they d tried missionaries every other way and never could get any good  out of  em  and so it annoyed all his relations to find out that that  man s life was fooled away just out of a dern d experiment  so to speak   but mind you  there ain t anything ever reely lost  everything that  people can t understand and don t see the reason of does good if you only  hold on and give it a fair shake  prov dence don t fire no blank  ca tridges  boys   that there missionary s substance  unbeknowns to  himself  actu ly converted every last one of them heathens that took a  chance at the barbacue   nothing ever fetched them but that   don t tell  me it was an accident that he was biled   there ain t no such a thing as  an accident      when my uncle lem was leaning up agin a scaffolding once  sick  or drunk   or suthin  an irishman with a hod full of bricks fell on him out of the  third story and broke the old man s back in two places   people said it  was an accident   much accident there was about that   he didn t know  what he was there for  but he was there for a good object   if he hadn t  been there the irishman would have been killed   nobody can ever make me  believe anything different from that   uncle lem s dog was there   why  didn t the irishman fall on the dog   becuz the dog would a seen him a  coming and stood from under   that s the reason the dog warn t appinted   a dog can t be depended on to carry out a special providence   mark my  words it was a put up thing   accidents don t happen  boys   uncle lem s  dog  i wish you could a seen that dog   he was a reglar shepherd  or  ruther he was part bull and part shepherd  splendid animal  belonged to  parson hagar before uncle lem got him   parson hagar belonged to the  western reserve hagars  prime family  his mother was a watson  one of his  sisters married a wheeler  they settled in morgan county  and he got  nipped by the machinery in a carpet factory and went through in less than  a quarter of a minute  his widder bought the piece of carpet that had his  remains wove in  and people come a hundred mile to  tend the funeral   there was fourteen yards in the piece      she wouldn t let them roll him up  but planted him just so  full length   the church was middling small where they preached the funeral  and they  had to let one end of the coffin stick out of the window   they didn t  bury him  they planted one end  and let him stand up  same as a monument   and they nailed a sign on it and put  put on  put on it  sacred to  the  m e m o r y  of fourteen y a r d s  of three ply  car   pet  containing  all that was  m o r t a l  of  of  w i l l i a m  w h e       jim blaine had been growing gradually drowsy and drowsier  his head  nodded  once  twice  three times  dropped peacefully upon his breast  and  he fell tranquilly asleep   the tears were running down the boys  cheeks    they were suffocating with suppressed laughter  and had been from the  start  though i had never noticed it   i perceived that i was  sold    i learned then that jim blaine s peculiarity was that whenever he reached  a certain stage of intoxication  no human power could keep him from  setting out  with impressive unction  to tell about a wonderful adventure  which he had once had with his grandfather s old ram  and the mention of  the ram in the first sentence was as far as any man had ever heard him  get  concerning it   he always maundered off  interminably  from one  thing to another  till his whisky got the best of him and he fell asleep   what the thing was that happened to him and his grandfather s old ram is  a dark mystery to this day  for nobody has ever yet found out           chapter liv     of course there was a large chinese population in virginia  it is the  case with every town and city on the pacific coast   they are a harmless  race when white men either let them alone or treat them no worse than  dogs  in fact they are almost entirely harmless anyhow  for they seldom  think of resenting the vilest insults or the cruelest injuries   they are  quiet  peaceable  tractable  free from drunkenness  and they are as  industrious as the day is long   a disorderly chinaman is rare  and a  lazy one does not exist   so long as a chinaman has strength to use his  hands he needs no support from anybody  white men often complain of want  of work  but a chinaman offers no such complaint  he always manages to  find something to do   he is a great convenience to everybody  even to  the worst class of white men  for he bears the most of their sins   suffering fines for their petty thefts  imprisonment for their robberies   and death for their murders   any white man can swear a chinaman s life  away in the courts  but no chinaman can testify against a white man   ours is the  land of the free   nobody denies that  nobody challenges it    maybe it is because we won t let other people testify   as i write  news  comes that in broad daylight in san francisco  some boys have stoned an  inoffensive chinaman to death  and that although a large crowd witnessed  the shameful deed  no one interfered     there are seventy thousand  and possibly one hundred thousand  chinamen  on the pacific coast   there were about a thousand in virginia   they  were penned into a  chinese quarter   a thing which they do not  particularly object to  as they are fond of herding together   their  buildings were of wood  usually only one story high  and set thickly  together along streets scarcely wide enough for a wagon to pass through   their quarter was a little removed from the rest of the town   the chief  employment of chinamen in towns is to wash clothing   they always send a  bill  like this below  pinned to the clothes   it is mere ceremony  for  it does not enlighten the customer much   their price for washing was        per dozen  rather cheaper than white people could afford to wash  for at that time   a very common sign on the chinese houses was   see  yup  washer and ironer    hong wo  washer    sam sing   ah hop  washing    the house servants  cooks  etc   in california and nevada  were chiefly  chinamen   there were few white servants and no chinawomen so employed   chinamen make good house servants  being quick  obedient  patient  quick  to learn and tirelessly industrious   they do not need to be taught a  thing twice  as a general thing   they are imitative   if a chinaman were  to see his master break up a centre table  in a passion  and kindle a  fire with it  that chinaman would be likely to resort to the furniture  for fuel forever afterward     all chinamen can read  write and cipher with easy facility  pity but all  our petted voters could   in california they rent little patches of  ground and do a deal of gardening   they will raise surprising crops of  vegetables on a sand pile   they waste nothing   what is rubbish to a  christian  a chinaman carefully preserves and makes useful in one way or  another   he gathers up all the old oyster and sardine cans that white  people throw away  and procures marketable tin and solder from them by  melting   he gathers up old bones and turns them into manure   in california he gets a living out of old mining claims that white men  have abandoned as exhausted and worthless  and then the officers come  down on him once a month with an exorbitant swindle to which the  legislature has given the broad  general name of  foreign  mining tax   but it is usually inflicted on no foreigners but chinamen   this swindle  has in some cases been repeated once or twice on the same victim in the  course of the same month  but the public treasury was no additionally  enriched by it  probably     chinamen hold their dead in great reverence  they worship their departed  ancestors  in fact   hence  in china  a man s front yard  back yard  or  any other part of his premises  is made his family burying ground  in  order that he may visit the graves at any and all times   therefore that  huge empire is one mighty cemetery  it is ridged and wringled from its  centre to its circumference with graves  and inasmuch as every foot of  ground must be made to do its utmost  in china  lest the swarming  population suffer for food  the very graves are cultivated and yield a  harvest  custom holding this to be no dishonor to the dead   since the  departed are held in such worshipful reverence  a chinaman cannot bear  that any indignity be offered the places where they sleep   mr  burlingame said that herein lay china s bitter opposition to  railroads  a road could not be built anywhere in the empire without  disturbing the graves of their ancestors or friends     a chinaman hardly believes he could enjoy the hereafter except his body  lay in his beloved china  also  he desires to receive  himself  after  death  that worship with which he has honored his dead that preceded him   therefore  if he visits a foreign country  he makes arrangements to have  his bones returned to china in case he dies  if he hires to go to a  foreign country on a labor contract  there is always a stipulation that  his body shall be taken back to china if he dies  if the government sells  a gang of coolies to a foreigner for the usual five year term  it is  specified in the contract that their bodies shall be restored to china in  case of death   on the pacific coast the chinamen all belong to one or  another of several great companies or organizations  and these companies  keep track of their members  register their names  and ship their bodies  home when they die   the see yup company is held to be the largest of  these   the ning yeong company is next  and numbers eighteen thousand  members on the coast   its headquarters are at san francisco  where it  has a costly temple  several great officers  one of whom keeps regal  state in seclusion and cannot be approached by common humanity   and a  numerous priesthood   in it i was shown a register of its members  with  the dead and the date of their shipment to china duly marked   every ship  that sails from san francisco carries away a heavy freight of chinese  corpses  or did  at least  until the legislature  with an ingenious  refinement of christian cruelty  forbade the shipments  as a neat  underhanded way of deterring chinese immigration   the bill was offered   whether it passed or not   it is my impression that it passed   there was  another bill  it became a law  compelling every incoming chinaman to be  vaccinated on the wharf and pay a duly appointed quack  no decent doctor  would defile himself with such legalized robbery  ten dollars for it   as few importers of chinese would want to go to an expense like that  the  law makers thought this would be another heavy blow to chinese  immigration     what the chinese quarter of virginia was like  or  indeed  what the  chinese quarter of any pacific coast town was and is like  may be  gathered from this item which i printed in the enterprise while reporting  for that paper           chinatown   accompanied by a fellow reporter  we made a trip through        our chinese quarter the other night   the chinese have built their        portion of the city to suit themselves  and as they keep neither        carriages nor wagons  their streets are not wide enough  as a        general thing  to admit of the passage of vehicles   at ten o clock        at night the chinaman may be seen in all his glory   in every little        cooped up  dingy cavern of a hut  faint with the odor of burning        josh lights and with nothing to see the gloom by save the sickly         guttering tallow candle  were two or three yellow  long tailed        vagabonds  coiled up on a sort of short truckle bed  smoking opium         motionless and with their lustreless eyes turned inward from excess        of satisfaction  or rather the recent smoker looks thus  immediately        after having passed the pipe to his neighbor  for opium smoking is a        comfortless operation  and requires constant attention   a lamp sits        on the bed  the length of the long pipe stem from the smoker s        mouth  he puts a pellet of opium on the end of a wire  sets it on        fire  and plasters it into the pipe much as a christian would fill a        hole with putty  then he applies the bowl to the lamp and proceeds        to smoke  and the stewing and frying of the drug and the gurgling of        the juices in the stem would well nigh turn the stomach of a statue         john likes it  though  it soothes him  he takes about two dozen        whiffs  and then rolls over to dream  heaven only knows what  for we        could not imagine by looking at the soggy creature   possibly in his        visions he travels far away from the gross world and his regular        washing  and feast on succulent rats and birds  nests in paradise     mr  ah sing keeps a general grocery and provision store at no      wang  street   he lavished his hospitality upon our party in the friendliest  way   he had various kinds of colored and colorless wines and brandies   with unpronouncable names  imported from china in little crockery jugs   and which he offered to us in dainty little miniature wash basins of  porcelain   he offered us a mess of birds  nests  also  small  neat  sausages  of which we could have swallowed several yards if we had chosen  to try  but we suspected that each link contained the corpse of a mouse   and therefore refrained   mr  sing had in his store a thousand articles  of merchandise  curious to behold  impossible to imagine the uses of  and  beyond our ability to describe     his ducks  however  and his eggs  we could understand  the former were  split open and flattened out like codfish  and came from china in that  shape  and the latter were plastered over with some kind of paste which  kept them fresh and palatable through the long voyage     we found mr  hong wo  no     chow chow street  making up a lottery  scheme  in fact we found a dozen others occupied in the same way in  various parts of the quarter  for about every third chinaman runs a  lottery  and the balance of the tribe  buck  at it    tom   who speaks  faultless english  and used to be chief and only cook to the territorial  enterprise  when the establishment kept bachelor s hall two years ago   said that  sometime chinaman buy ticket one dollar hap  ketch um two tree  hundred  sometime no ketch um anything  lottery like one man fight um  seventy  may be he whip  may be he get whip heself  welly good      however  the percentage being sixty nine against him  the chances are   as a general thing  that  he get whip heself    we could not see that  these lotteries differed in any respect from our own  save that the  figures being chinese  no ignorant white man might ever hope to succeed  in telling  t other from which   the manner of drawing is similar to  ours     mr  see yup keeps a fancy store on live fox street   he sold us fans of  white feathers  gorgeously ornamented  perfumery that smelled like  limburger cheese  chinese pens  and watch charms made of a stone  unscratchable with steel instruments  yet polished and tinted like the  inner coat of a sea shell   as tokens of his esteem  see yup presented  the party with gaudy plumes made of gold tinsel and trimmed with  peacocks  feathers     we ate chow chow with chop sticks in the celestial restaurants  our  comrade chided the moon eyed damsels in front of the houses for their  want of feminine reserve  we received protecting josh lights from our  hosts and  dickered  for a pagan god or two   finally  we were impressed  with the genius of a chinese book keeper  he figured up his accounts on a  machine like a gridiron with buttons strung on its bars  the different  rows represented units  tens  hundreds and thousands   he fingered them  with incredible rapidity  in fact  he pushed them from place to place as  fast as a musical professor s fingers travel over the keys of a piano     they are a kindly disposed  well meaning race  and are respected and well  treated by the upper classes  all over the pacific coast   no californian  gentleman or lady ever abuses or oppresses a chinaman  under any  circumstances  an explanation that seems to be much needed in the east   only the scum of the population do it  they and their children  they   and  naturally and consistently  the policemen and politicians  likewise   for these are the dust licking pimps and slaves of the scum  there as  well as elsewhere in america           chapter lv     i began to get tired of staying in one place so long     there was no longer satisfying variety in going down to carson to report  the proceedings of the legislature once a year  and horse races and  pumpkin shows once in three months   they had got to raising pumpkins and  potatoes in washoe valley  and of course one of the first achievements of  the legislature was to institute a ten thousand dollar agricultural fair  to show off forty dollars  worth of those pumpkins in  however  the  territorial legislature was usually spoken of as the  asylum     i wanted  to see san francisco   i wanted to go somewhere   i wanted  i did not  know what i wanted   i had the  spring fever  and wanted a change   principally  no doubt   besides  a convention had framed a state  constitution  nine men out of every ten wanted an office  i believed that  these gentlemen would  treat  the moneyless and the irresponsible among  the population into adopting the constitution and thus well nigh killing  the country  it could not well carry such a load as a state government   since it had nothing to tax that could stand a tax  for undeveloped mines  could not  and there were not fifty developed ones in the land  there was  but little realty to tax  and it did seem as if nobody was ever going to  think of the simple salvation of inflicting a money penalty on murder    i believed that a state government would destroy the  flush times   and i  wanted to get away   i believed that the mining stocks i had on hand  would soon be worth           and thought if they reached that before the  constitution was adopted  i would sell out and make myself secure from  the crash the change of government was going to bring   i considered           sufficient to go home with decently  though it was but a small  amount compared to what i had been expecting to return with   i felt  rather down hearted about it  but i tried to comfort myself with the  reflection that with such a sum i could not fall into want   about this  time a schoolmate of mine whom i had not seen since boyhood  came  tramping in on foot from reese river  a very allegory of poverty   the son of wealthy parents  here he was  in a strange land  hungry   bootless  mantled in an ancient horse blanket  roofed with a brimless  hat  and so generally and so extravagantly dilapidated that he could have   taken the shine out of the prodigal son himself   as he pleasantly  remarked     he wanted to borrow forty six dollars  twenty six to take him to san  francisco  and twenty for something else  to buy some soap with  maybe   for he needed it   i found i had but little more than the amount wanted   in my pocket  so i stepped in and borrowed forty six dollars of a banker   on twenty days  time  without the formality of a note   and gave it him   rather than walk half a block to the office  where i had some specie laid  up   if anybody had told me that it would take me two years to pay back  that forty six dollars to the banker  for i did not expect it of the  prodigal  and was not disappointed   i would have felt injured   and so  would the banker     i wanted a change   i wanted variety of some kind   it came   mr  goodman  went away for a week and left me the post of chief editor   it destroyed  me   the first day  i wrote my  leader  in the forenoon   the second day   i had no subject and put it off till the afternoon   the third day i put  it off till evening  and then copied an elaborate editorial out of the   american cyclopedia   that steadfast friend of the editor  all over this  land   the fourth day i  fooled around  till midnight  and then fell back  on the cyclopedia again   the fifth day i cudgeled my brain till  midnight  and then kept the press waiting while i penned some bitter  personalities on six different people   the sixth day i labored in  anguish till far into the night and brought forth  nothing   the paper  went to press without an editorial   the seventh day i resigned   on the  eighth  mr  goodman returned and found six duels on his hands  my  personalities had borne fruit     nobody  except he has tried it  knows what it is to be an editor   it is  easy to scribble local rubbish  with the facts all before you  it is easy  to clip selections from other papers  it is easy to string out a  correspondence from any locality  but it is unspeakable hardship to write  editorials   subjects are the trouble  the dreary lack of them  i mean   every day  it is drag  drag  drag  think  and worry and suffer  all the  world is a dull blank  and yet the editorial columns must be filled   only give the editor a subject  and his work is done  it is no trouble to  write it up  but fancy how you would feel if you had to pump your brains  dry every day in the week  fifty two weeks in the year   it makes one low  spirited simply to think of it   the matter that each editor of a daily  paper in america writes in the course of a year would fill from four to  eight bulky volumes like this book   fancy what a library an editor s  work would make  after twenty or thirty years  service   yet people often  marvel that dickens  scott  bulwer  dumas  etc   have been able to  produce so many books   if these authors had wrought as voluminously as  newspaper editors do  the result would be something to marvel at  indeed   how editors can continue this tremendous labor  this exhausting  consumption of brain fibre  for their work is creative  and not a mere  mechanical laying up of facts  like reporting   day after day and year  after year  is incomprehensible   preachers take two months  holiday in  midsummer  for they find that to produce two sermons a week is wearing   in the long run   in truth it must be so  and is so  and therefore  how  an editor can take from ten to twenty texts and build upon them from ten  to twenty painstaking editorials a week and keep it up all the year  round  is farther beyond comprehension than ever   ever since i survived  my week as editor  i have found at least one pleasure in any newspaper  that comes to my hand  it is in admiring the long columns of editorial   and wondering to myself how in the mischief he did it     mr  goodman s return relieved me of employment  unless i chose to become  a reporter again   i could not do that  i could not serve in the ranks  after being general of the army   so i thought i would depart and go  abroad into the world somewhere   just at this juncture  dan  my  associate in the reportorial department  told me  casually  that two  citizens had been trying to persuade him to go with them to new york and  aid in selling a rich silver mine which they had discovered and secured  in a new mining district in our neighborhood   he said they offered to  pay his expenses and give him one third of the proceeds of the sale   he had refused to go   it was the very opportunity i wanted   i abused  him for keeping so quiet about it  and not mentioning it sooner   he said  it had not occurred to him that i would like to go  and so he had  recommended them to apply to marshall  the reporter of the other paper   i asked dan if it was a good  honest mine  and no swindle   he said the  men had shown him nine tons of the rock  which they had got out to take  to new york  and he could cheerfully say that he had seen but little rock  in nevada that was richer  and moreover  he said that they had secured a  tract of valuable timber and a mill site  near the mine   my first idea  was to kill dan   but i changed my mind  notwithstanding i was so angry   for i thought maybe the chance was not yet lost   dan said it was by no  means lost  that the men were absent at the mine again  and would not be  in virginia to leave for the east for some ten days  that they had  requested him to do the talking to marshall  and he had promised that he  would either secure marshall or somebody else for them by the time they  got back  he would now say nothing to anybody till they returned  and  then fulfil his promise by furnishing me to them     it was splendid   i went to bed all on fire with excitement  for nobody  had yet gone east to sell a nevada silver mine  and the field was white  for the sickle   i felt that such a mine as the one described by dan  would bring a princely sum in new york  and sell without delay or  difficulty   i could not sleep  my fancy so rioted through its castles in  the air   it was the  blind lead  come again     next day i got away  on the coach  with the usual eclat attending  departures of old citizens   for if you have only half a dozen friends  out there they will make noise for a hundred rather than let you seem to  go away neglected and unregretted  and dan promised to keep strict watch  for the men that had the mine to sell     the trip was signalized but by one little incident  and that occurred  just as we were about to start   a very seedy looking vagabond passenger  got out of the stage a moment to wait till the usual ballast of silver  bricks was thrown in   he was standing on the pavement  when an awkward  express employee  carrying a brick weighing a hundred pounds  stumbled  and let it fall on the bummer s foot   he instantly dropped on the ground  and began to howl in the most heart breaking way   a sympathizing crowd  gathered around and were going to pull his boot off  but he screamed  louder than ever and they desisted  then he fell to gasping  and between  the gasps ejaculated  brandy   for heaven s sake  brandy    they poured  half a pint down him  and it wonderfully restored and comforted him   then he begged the people to assist him to the stage  which was done   the express people urged him to have a doctor at their expense  but he  declined  and said that if he only had a little brandy to take along with  him  to soothe his paroxyms of pain when they came on  he would be  grateful and content   he was quickly supplied with two bottles  and we  drove off   he was so smiling and happy after that  that i could not  refrain from asking him how he could possibly be so comfortable with a  crushed foot      well   said he   i hadn t had a drink for twelve hours  and hadn t a  cent to my name   i was most perishing  and so  when that duffer dropped  that hundred pounder on my foot  i see my chance   got a cork leg  you  know   and he pulled up his pantaloons and proved it     he was as drunk as a lord all day long  and full of chucklings over his  timely ingenuity     one drunken man necessarily reminds one of another   i once heard a  gentleman tell about an incident which he witnessed in a californian  bar room   he entitled it  ye modest man taketh a drink    it was nothing  but a bit of acting  but it seemed to me a perfect rendering  and worthy  of toodles himself   the modest man  tolerably far gone with beer and  other matters  enters a saloon  twenty five cents is the price for  anything and everything  and specie the only money used  and lays down a  half dollar  calls for whiskey and drinks it  the bar keeper makes change  and lays the quarter in a wet place on the counter  the modest man  fumbles at it with nerveless fingers  but it slips and the water holds  it  he contemplates it  and tries again  same result  observes that  people are interested in what he is at  blushes  fumbles at the quarter  again  blushes  puts his forefinger carefully  slowly down  to make sure  of his aim  pushes the coin toward the bar keeper  and says with a sigh      gimme a cigar      naturally  another gentleman present told about another drunken man   he  said he reeled toward home late at night  made a mistake and entered the  wrong gate  thought he saw a dog on the stoop  and it was  an iron one     he stopped and considered  wondered if it was a dangerous dog  ventured  to say  be  hic  begone    no effect   then he approached warily  and  adopted conciliation  pursed up his lips and tried to whistle  but  failed  still approached  saying   poor dog   doggy  doggy  doggy   poor  doggy dog    got up on the stoop  still petting with fond names  till  master of the advantages  then exclaimed   leave  you thief    planted a  vindictive kick in his ribs  and went head over heels overboard  of  course   a pause  a sigh or two of pain  and then a remark in a  reflective voice      awful solid dog   what could he ben eating     ic   rocks  p raps   such animals is dangerous      at s what i say  they re dangerous   if a  man    ic    if a man wants to feed a dog on rocks  let him feed him on  rocks   at s all right  but let him keep him at home  not have him layin   round promiscuous  where   ic   where people s liable to stumble over him  when they ain t noticin       it was not without regret that i took a last look at the tiny flag  it  was thirty five feet long and ten feet wide  fluttering like a lady s  handkerchief from the topmost peak of mount davidson  two thousand feet  above virginia s roofs  and felt that doubtless i was bidding a permanent  farewell to a city which had afforded me the most vigorous enjoyment of  life i had ever experienced   and this reminds me of an incident which  the dullest memory virginia could boast at the time it happened must  vividly recall  at times  till its possessor dies   late one summer  afternoon we had a rain shower     that was astonishing enough  in itself  to set the whole town buzzing   for it only rains  during a week or two weeks  in the winter in nevada   and even then not enough at a time to make it worth while for any  merchant to keep umbrellas for sale   but the rain was not the chief  wonder   it only lasted five or ten minutes  while the people were still  talking about it all the heavens gathered to themselves a dense blackness  as of midnight   all the vast eastern front of mount davidson   over looking the city  put on such a funereal gloom that only the  nearness and solidity of the mountain made its outlines even faintly  distinguishable from the dead blackness of the heavens they rested  against   this unaccustomed sight turned all eyes toward the mountain   and as they looked  a little tongue of rich golden flame was seen waving  and quivering in the heart of the midnight  away up on the extreme  summit  in a few minutes the streets were packed with people  gazing with  hardly an uttered word  at the one brilliant mote in the brooding world  of darkness   it flicked like a candle flame  and looked no larger  but  with such a background it was wonderfully bright  small as it was   it  was the flag   though no one suspected it at first  it seemed so like a  supernatural visitor of some kind  a mysterious messenger of good  tidings  some were fain to believe   it was the nation s emblem  transfigured by the departing rays of a sun that was entirely palled from  view  and on no other object did the glory fall  in all the broad  panorama of mountain ranges and deserts   not even upon the staff of the  flag  for that  a needle in the distance at any time  was now untouched  by the light and undistinguishable in the gloom   for a whole hour the  weird visitor winked and burned in its lofty solitude  and still the  thousands of uplifted eyes watched it with fascinated interest   how the  people were wrought up   the superstition grew apace that this was a  mystic courier come with great news from the war  the poetry of the idea  excusing and commending it  and on it spread  from heart to heart  from  lip to lip and from street to street  till there was a general impulse to  have out the military and welcome the bright waif with a salvo of  artillery     and all that time one sorely tried man  the telegraph operator sworn to  official secrecy  had to lock his lips and chain his tongue with a  silence that was like to rend them  for he  and he only  of all the  speculating multitude  knew the great things this sinking sun had seen  that day in the east  vicksburg fallen  and the union arms victorious at  gettysburg     but for the journalistic monopoly that forbade the slightest revealment  of eastern news till a day after its publication in the california  papers  the glorified flag on mount davidson would have been saluted and  re saluted  that memorable evening  as long as there was a charge of  powder to thunder with  the city would have been illuminated  and every  man that had any respect for himself would have got drunk   as was the  custom of the country on all occasions of public moment   even at this  distant day i cannot think of this needlessly marred supreme opportunity  without regret   what a time we might have had           chapter lvi     we rumbled over the plains and valleys  climbed the sierras to the  clouds  and looked down upon summer clad california   and i will remark  here  in passing  that all scenery in california requires distance to  give it its highest charm   the mountains are imposing in their sublimity  and their majesty of form and altitude  from any point of view  but one  must have distance to soften their ruggedness and enrich their tintings   a californian forest is best at a little distance  for there is a sad  poverty of variety in species  the trees being chiefly of one monotonous  family  redwood  pine  spruce  fir  and so  at a near view there is a  wearisome sameness of attitude in their rigid arms  stretched down ward  and outward in one continued and reiterated appeal to all men to  sh     don t say a word   you might disturb somebody    close at hand  too   there is a reliefless and relentless smell of pitch and turpentine  there  is a ceaseless melancholy in their sighing and complaining foliage  one  walks over a soundless carpet of beaten yellow bark and dead spines of  the foliage till he feels like a wandering spirit bereft of a footfall   he tires of the endless tufts of needles and yearns for substantial   shapely leaves  he looks for moss and grass to loll upon  and finds none   for where there is no bark there is naked clay and dirt  enemies to  pensive musing and clean apparel   often a grassy plain in california  is  what it should be  but often  too  it is best contemplated at a distance   because although its grass blades are tall  they stand up vindictively  straight and self sufficient  and are unsociably wide apart  with  uncomely spots of barren sand between     one of the queerest things i know of  is to hear tourists from  the  states  go into ecstasies over the loveliness of  ever blooming  california    and they always do go into that sort of ecstasies   but  perhaps they would modify them if they knew how old californians  with  the memory full upon them of the dust covered and questionable summer  greens of californian  verdure   stand astonished  and filled with  worshipping admiration  in the presence of the lavish richness  the  brilliant green  the infinite freshness  the spend thrift variety of form  and species and foliage that make an eastern landscape a vision of  paradise itself   the idea of a man falling into raptures over grave and  sombre california  when that man has seen new england s meadow expanses  and her maples  oaks and cathedral windowed elms decked in summer attire   or the opaline splendors of autumn descending upon her forests  comes  very near being funny  would be  in fact  but that it is so pathetic   no land with an unvarying climate can be very beautiful   the tropics are  not  for all the sentiment that is wasted on them   they seem beautiful  at first  but sameness impairs the charm by and by   change is the  handmaiden nature requires to do her miracles with   the land that has  four well defined seasons  cannot lack beauty  or pall with monotony   each season brings a world of enjoyment and interest in the watching of  its unfolding  its gradual  harmonious development  its culminating  graces  and just as one begins to tire of it  it passes away and a  radical change comes  with new witcheries and new glories in its train   and i think that to one in sympathy with nature  each season  in its  turn  seems the loveliest     san francisco  a truly fascinating city to live in  is stately and  handsome at a fair distance  but close at hand one notes that the  architecture is mostly old fashioned  many streets are made up of  decaying  smoke grimed  wooden houses  and the barren sand hills toward  the outskirts obtrude themselves too prominently   even the kindly  climate is sometimes pleasanter when read about than personally  experienced  for a lovely  cloudless sky wears out its welcome by and by   and then when the longed for rain does come it stays   even the playful  earthquake is better contemplated at a dis        however there are varying opinions about that     the climate of san francisco is mild and singularly equable   the  thermometer stands at about seventy degrees the year round   it hardly  changes at all   you sleep under one or two light blankets summer and  winter  and never use a mosquito bar   nobody ever wears summer clothing   you wear black broadcloth  if you have it  in august and january  just  the same   it is no colder  and no warmer  in the one month than the  other   you do not use overcoats and you do not use fans   it is as  pleasant a climate as could well be contrived  take it all around  and is  doubtless the most unvarying in the whole world   the wind blows there a  good deal in the summer months  but then you can go over to oakland  if  you choose  three or four miles away  it does not blow there   it has  only snowed twice in san francisco in nineteen years  and then it only  remained on the ground long enough to astonish the children  and set them  to wondering what the feathery stuff was     during eight months of the year  straight along  the skies are bright and  cloudless  and never a drop of rain falls   but when the other four  months come along  you will need to go and steal an umbrella   because  you will require it   not just one day  but one hundred and twenty days  in hardly varying succession   when you want to go visiting  or attend  church  or the theatre  you never look up at the clouds to see whether it  is likely to rain or not  you look at the almanac   if it is winter  it  will rain  and if it is summer  it won t rain  and you cannot help it   you never need a lightning rod  because it never thunders and it never  lightens   and after you have listened for six or eight weeks  every  night  to the dismal monotony of those quiet rains  you will wish in your  heart the thunder would leap and crash and roar along those drowsy skies  once  and make everything alive  you will wish the prisoned lightnings  would cleave the dull firmament asunder and light it with a blinding  glare for one little instant   you would give anything to hear the old  familiar thunder again and see the lightning strike somebody   and along  in the summer  when you have suffered about four months of lustrous   pitiless sunshine  you are ready to go down on your knees and plead for  rain  hail  snow  thunder and lightning  anything to break the monotony    you will take an earthquake  if you cannot do any better   and the  chances are that you ll get it  too     san francisco is built on sand hills  but they are prolific sand hills   they yield a generous vegetation   all the rare flowers which people in   the states  rear with such patient care in parlor flower pots and  green houses  flourish luxuriantly in the open air there all the year  round  calla lilies  all sorts of geraniums  passion flowers  moss  roses  i do not know the names of a tenth part of them   i only know that  while new yorkers are burdened with banks and drifts of snow   californians are burdened with banks and drifts of flowers  if they only  keep their hands off and let them grow   and i have heard that they have  also that rarest and most curious of all the flowers  the beautiful  espiritu santo  as the spaniards call it  or flower of the holy spirit    though i thought it grew only in central america  down on the isthmus   in its cup is the daintiest little facsimile of a dove  as pure as snow   the spaniards have a superstitious reverence for it   the blossom has  been conveyed to the states  submerged in ether  and the bulb has been  taken thither also  but every attempt to make it bloom after it arrived   has failed     i have elsewhere spoken of the endless winter of mono  california  and  but this moment of the eternal spring of san francisco   now if we travel  a hundred miles in a straight line  we come to the eternal summer of  sacramento   one never sees summer clothing or mosquitoes in san  francisco  but they can be found in sacramento   not always and  unvaryingly  but about one hundred and forty three months out of twelve  years  perhaps   flowers bloom there  always  the reader can easily  believe  people suffer and sweat  and swear  morning  noon and night  and  wear out their stanchest energies fanning themselves   it gets hot there   but if you go down to fort yuma you will find it hotter   fort yuma is  probably the hottest place on earth   the thermometer stays at one  hundred and twenty in the shade there all the time  except when it varies  and goes higher   it is a u s  military post  and its occupants get so  used to the terrific heat that they suffer without it   there is a  tradition  attributed to john phenix  it has been purloined by fifty  different scribblers who were too poor to invent a fancy but not ashamed  to steal one   m   t    that a very  very wicked soldier died there   once  and of course  went straight to the hottest corner of perdition     and the next day he telegraphed back for his blankets   there is no doubt  about the truth of this statement  there can be no doubt about it   i  have seen the place where that soldier used to board   in sacramento it  is fiery summer always  and you can gather roses  and eat strawberries  and ice cream  and wear white linen clothes  and pant and perspire  at  eight or nine o clock in the morning  and then take the cars  and at noon  put on your furs and your skates  and go skimming over frozen donner  lake  seven thousand feet above the valley  among snow banks fifteen feet  deep  and in the shadow of grand mountain peaks that lift their frosty  crags ten thousand feet above the level of the sea     there is a transition for you   where will you find another like it in  the western hemisphere   and some of us have swept around snow walled  curves of the pacific railroad in that vicinity  six thousand feet above  the sea  and looked down as the birds do  upon the deathless summer of  the sacramento valley  with its fruitful fields  its feathery foliage   its silver streams  all slumbering in the mellow haze of its enchanted  atmosphere  and all infinitely softened and spiritualized by distance  a  dreamy  exquisite glimpse of fairyland  made all the more charming and  striking that it was caught through a forbidden gateway of ice and snow   and savage crags and precipices           chapter lvii     it was in this sacramento valley  just referred to  that a deal of the  most lucrative of the early gold mining was done  and you may still see   in places  its grassy slopes and levels torn and guttered and disfigured  by the avaricious spoilers of fifteen and twenty years ago   you may see  such disfigurements far and wide over california  and in some such  places  where only meadows and forests are visible  not a living  creature  not a house  no stick or stone or remnant of a ruin  and not a  sound  not even a whisper to disturb the sabbath stillness  you will find  it hard to believe that there stood at one time a fiercely flourishing  little city  of two thousand or three thousand souls  with its newspaper   fire company  brass band  volunteer militia  bank  hotels  noisy fourth  of july processions and speeches  gambling hells crammed with tobacco  smoke  profanity  and rough bearded men of all nations and colors  with  tables heaped with gold dust sufficient for the revenues of a german  principality  streets crowded and rife with business  town lots worth  four hundred dollars a front foot  labor  laughter  music  dancing   swearing  fighting  shooting  stabbing  a bloody inquest and a man for  breakfast every morning  everything that delights and adorns existence    all the appointments and appurtenances of a thriving and prosperous and  promising young city   and now nothing is left of it all but a lifeless   homeless solitude   the men are gone  the houses have vanished  even the  name of the place is forgotten   in no other land  in modern times  have  towns so absolutely died and disappeared  as in the old mining regions of  california     it was a driving  vigorous  restless population in those days   it was a  curious population   it was the only population of the kind that the  world has ever seen gathered together  and it is not likely that the  world will ever see its like again   for observe  it was an assemblage of  two hundred thousand young men  not simpering  dainty  kid gloved  weaklings  but stalwart  muscular  dauntless young braves  brimful of  push and energy  and royally endowed with every attribute that goes to  make up a peerless and magnificent manhood  the very pick and choice of  the world s glorious ones   no women  no children  no gray and stooping  veterans   none but erect  bright eyed  quick moving  strong handed young  giants  the strangest population  the finest population  the most gallant  host that ever trooped down the startled solitudes of an unpeopled land   and where are they now   scattered to the ends of the earth  or  prematurely aged and decrepit  or shot or stabbed in street affrays  or  dead of disappointed hopes and broken hearts  all gone  or nearly all    victims devoted upon the altar of the golden calf  the noblest holocaust  that ever wafted its sacrificial incense heavenward   it is pitiful to  think upon     it was a splendid population  for all the slow  sleepy  sluggish brained  sloths staid at home  you never find that sort of people among pioneers    you cannot build pioneers out of that sort of material   it was that  population that gave to california a name for getting up astounding  enterprises and rushing them through with a magnificent dash and daring  and a recklessness of cost or consequences  which she bears unto this  day  and when she projects a new surprise  the grave world smiles as  usual  and says  well  that is california all over      but they were rough in those times   they fairly reveled in gold  whisky   fights  and fandangoes  and were unspeakably happy   the honest miner  raked from a hundred to a thousand dollars out of his claim a day  and  what with the gambling dens and the other entertainments  he hadn t a  cent the next morning  if he had any sort of luck   they cooked their own  bacon and beans  sewed on their own buttons  washed their own shirts    blue woollen ones  and if a man wanted a fight on his hands without any  annoying delay  all he had to do was to appear in public in a white shirt  or a stove pipe hat  and he would be accommodated   for those people  hated aristocrats   they had a particular and malignant animosity toward  what they called a  biled shirt      it was a wild  free  disorderly  grotesque society   men  only swarming  hosts of stalwart men  nothing juvenile  nothing feminine  visible  anywhere     in those days miners would flock in crowds to catch a glimpse of that  rare and blessed spectacle  a woman   old inhabitants tell how  in a  certain camp  the news went abroad early in the morning that a woman was  come   they had seen a calico dress hanging out of a wagon down at the  camping ground  sign of emigrants from over the great plains   everybody  went down there  and a shout went up when an actual  bona fide dress was  discovered fluttering in the wind   the male emigrant was visible   the  miners said      fetch her out      he said   it is my wife  gentlemen  she is sick  we have been robbed of  money  provisions  everything  by the indians  we want to rest       fetch her out   we ve got to see her       but  gentlemen  the poor thing  she        fetch her out      he  fetched her out   and they swung their hats and sent up three rousing  cheers and a tiger  and they crowded around and gazed at her  and touched  her dress  and listened to her voice with the look of men who listened to  a memory rather than a present reality  and then they collected  twenty five hundred dollars in gold and gave it to the man  and swung  their hats again and gave three more cheers  and went home satisfied       once i dined in san francisco with the family of a pioneer  and talked  with his daughter  a young lady whose first experience in san francisco  was an adventure  though she herself did not remember it  as she was only  two or three years old at the time   her father said that  after landing  from the ship  they were walking up the street  a servant leading the  party with the little girl in her arms   and presently a huge miner   bearded  belted  spurred  and bristling with deadly weapons  just down  from a long campaign in the mountains  evidently barred the way  stopped  the servant  and stood gazing  with a face all alive with gratification  and astonishment   then he said  reverently      well  if it ain t a child   and then he snatched a little leather sack  out of his pocket and said to the servant      there s a hundred and fifty dollars in dust  there  and i ll give it to  you to let me kiss the child      that anecdote is true     but see how things change   sitting at that dinner table  listening to  that anecdote  if i had offered double the money for the privilege of  kissing the same child  i would have been refused   seventeen added years  have far more than doubled the price     and while upon this subject i will remark that once in star city  in the  humboldt mountains  i took my place in a sort of long  post office single  file of miners  to patiently await my chance to peep through a crack in  the cabin and get a sight of the splendid new sensation  a genuine  live  woman   and at the end of half of an hour my turn came  and i put my eye  to the crack  and there she was  with one arm akimbo  and tossing  flap jacks in a frying pan with the other     and she was one hundred and sixty five  being in calmer mood  now  i  voluntarily knock off a hundred from that   m t   years old  and hadn t a  tooth in her head           chapter lviii     for a few months i enjoyed what to me was an entirely new phase of  existence  a butterfly idleness  nothing to do  nobody to be responsible  to  and untroubled with financial uneasiness   i fell in love with the  most cordial and sociable city in the union   after the sage brush and  alkali deserts of washoe  san francisco was paradise to me   i lived at  the best hotel  exhibited my clothes in the most conspicuous places   infested the opera  and learned to seem enraptured with music which  oftener afflicted my ignorant ear than enchanted it  if i had had the  vulgar honesty to confess it   however  i suppose i was not greatly worse  than the most of my countrymen in that   i had longed to be a butterfly   and i was one at last   i attended private parties in sumptuous evening  dress  simpered and aired my graces like a born beau  and polkad and  schottisched with a step peculiar to myself  and the kangaroo   in a  word  i kept the due state of a man worth a hundred thousand dollars   prospectively   and likely to reach absolute affluence when that  silver mine sale should be ultimately achieved in the east   i spent  money with a free hand  and meantime watched the stock sales with an  interested eye and looked to see what might happen in nevada     something very important happened   the property holders of nevada voted  against the state constitution  but the folks who had nothing to lose  were in the majority  and carried the measure over their heads   but  after all it did not immediately look like a disaster  though  unquestionably it was one i hesitated  calculated the chances  and then  concluded not to sell   stocks went on rising  speculation went mad   bankers  merchants  lawyers  doctors  mechanics  laborers  even the very  washerwomen and servant girls  were putting up their earnings on silver  stocks  and every sun that rose in the morning went down on paupers  enriched and rich men beggared   what a gambling carnival it was   gould  and curry soared to six thousand three hundred dollars a foot   and then    all of a sudden  out went the bottom and everything and everybody went  to ruin and destruction   the wreck was complete     the bubble scarcely left a microscopic moisture behind it   i was an  early beggar and a thorough one   my hoarded stocks were not worth the  paper they were printed on   i threw them all away   i  the cheerful  idiot that had been squandering money like water  and thought myself  beyond the reach of misfortune  had not now as much as fifty dollars when  i gathered together my various debts and paid them   i removed from the  hotel to a very private boarding house   i took a reporter s berth and  went to work   i was not entirely broken in spirit  for i was building  confidently on the sale of the silver mine in the east   but i could not  hear from dan   my letters miscarried or were not answered     one day i did not feel vigorous and remained away from the office   the  next day i went down toward noon as usual  and found a note on my desk  which had been there twenty four hours   it was signed  marshall   the  virginia reporter  and contained a request that i should call at the  hotel and see him and a friend or two that night  as they would sail for  the east in the morning   a postscript added that their errand was a big  mining speculation   i was hardly ever so sick in my life   i abused  myself for leaving virginia and entrusting to another man a matter i  ought to have attended to myself  i abused myself for remaining away from  the office on the one day of all the year that i should have been there   and thus berating myself i trotted a mile to the steamer wharf and  arrived just in time to be too late   the ship was in the stream and  under way     i comforted myself with the thought that may be the speculation would  amount to nothing  poor comfort at best  and then went back to my  slavery  resolved to put up with my thirty five dollars a week and forget  all about it     a month afterward i enjoyed my first earthquake   it was one which was  long called the  great  earthquake  and is doubtless so distinguished  till this day   it was just after noon  on a bright october day   i was  coming down third street   the only objects in motion anywhere in sight  in that thickly built and populous quarter  were a man in a buggy behind  me  and a street car wending slowly up the cross street   otherwise  all  was solitude and a sabbath stillness   as i turned the corner  around a  frame house  there was a great rattle and jar  and it occurred to me that  here was an item   no doubt a fight in that house   before i could turn  and seek the door  there came a really terrific shock  the ground seemed  to roll under me in waves  interrupted by a violent joggling up and down   and there was a heavy grinding noise as of brick houses rubbing together   i fell up against the frame house and hurt my elbow   i knew what it was   now  and from mere reportorial instinct  nothing else  took out my watch  and noted the time of day  at that moment a third and still severer shock  came  and as i reeled about on the pavement trying to keep my footing   i saw a sight   the entire front of a tall four story brick building in  third street sprung outward like a door and fell sprawling across the  street  raising a dust like a great volume of smoke   and here came the  buggy  overboard went the man  and in less time than i can tell it the  vehicle was distributed in small fragments along three hundred yards of  street     one could have fancied that somebody had fired a charge of chair rounds  and rags down the thoroughfare   the street car had stopped  the horses  were rearing and plunging  the passengers were pouring out at both ends   and one fat man had crashed half way through a glass window on one side  of the car  got wedged fast and was squirming and screaming like an  impaled madman   every door  of every house  as far as the eye could  reach  was vomiting a stream of human beings  and almost before one could  execute a wink and begin another  there was a massed multitude of people  stretching in endless procession down every street my position commanded   never was solemn solitude turned into teeming life quicker     of the wonders wrought by  the great earthquake   these were all that  came under my eye  but the tricks it did  elsewhere  and far and wide  over the town  made toothsome gossip for nine days     the destruction of property was trifling  the injury to it was  wide spread and somewhat serious     the  curiosities  of the earthquake were simply endless   gentlemen and  ladies who were sick  or were taking a siesta  or had dissipated till a  late hour and were making up lost sleep  thronged into the public streets  in all sorts of queer apparel  and some without any at all   one woman  who had been washing a naked child  ran down the street holding it by the  ankles as if it were a dressed turkey   prominent citizens who were  supposed to keep the sabbath strictly  rushed out of saloons in their  shirt sleeves  with billiard cues in their hands   dozens of men with  necks swathed in napkins  rushed from barber shops  lathered to the eyes  or with one cheek clean shaved and the other still bearing a hairy  stubble   horses broke from stables  and a frightened dog rushed up a  short attic ladder and out on to a roof  and when his scare was over had  not the nerve to go down again the same way he had gone up     a prominent editor flew down stairs  in the principal hotel  with nothing  on but one brief undergarment  met a chambermaid  and exclaimed      oh  what shall i do   where shall i go      she responded with naive serenity      if you have no choice  you might try a clothing store      a certain foreign consul s lady was the acknowledged leader of fashion   and every time she appeared in anything new or extraordinary  the ladies  in the vicinity made a raid on their husbands  purses and arrayed  themselves similarly   one man who had suffered considerably and growled  accordingly  was standing at the window when the shocks came  and the  next instant the consul s wife  just out of the bath  fled by with no  other apology for clothing than  a bath towel   the sufferer rose  superior to the terrors of the earthquake  and said to his wife      now that is something like   get out your towel my dear      the plastering that fell from ceilings in san francisco that day  would  have covered several acres of ground   for some days afterward  groups of  eyeing and pointing men stood about many a building  looking at long  zig zag cracks that extended from the eaves to the ground   four feet of  the tops of three chimneys on one house were broken square off and turned  around in such a way as to completely stop the draft     a crack a hundred feet long gaped open six inches wide in the middle of  one street and then shut together again with such force  as to ridge up  the meeting earth like a slender grave   a lady sitting in her rocking  and quaking parlor  saw the wall part at the ceiling  open and shut  twice  like a mouth  and then drop the end of a brick on the floor like a  tooth   she was a woman easily disgusted with foolishness  and she arose  and went out of there   one lady who was coming down stairs was  astonished to see a bronze hercules lean forward on its pedestal as if to  strike her with its club   they both reached the bottom of the flight at  the same time   the woman insensible from the fright   her child  born  some little time afterward  was club footed   however  on second  thought   if the reader sees any coincidence in this  he must do it at  his own risk     the first shock brought down two or three huge organ pipes in one of the  churches   the minister  with uplifted hands  was just closing the  services   he glanced up  hesitated  and said      however  we will omit the benediction    and the next instant there was  a vacancy in the atmosphere where he had stood     after the first shock  an oakland minister said      keep your seats   there is no better place to die than this       and added  after the third      but outside is good enough    he then skipped out at the back door     such another destruction of mantel ornaments and toilet bottles as the  earthquake created  san francisco never saw before   there was hardly a  girl or a matron in the city but suffered losses of this kind   suspended  pictures were thrown down  but oftener still  by a curious freak of the  earthquake s humor  they were whirled completely around with their faces  to the wall   there was great difference of opinion  at first  as to the  course or direction the earthquake traveled  but water that splashed out  of various tanks and buckets settled that   thousands of people were made  so sea sick by the rolling and pitching of floors and streets that they  were weak and bed ridden for hours  and some few for even days  afterward   hardly an individual escaped nausea entirely     the queer earthquake  episodes that formed the staple of san francisco  gossip for the next week would fill a much larger book than this  and so  i will diverge from the subject     by and by  in the due course of things  i picked up a copy of the  enterprise one day  and fell under this cruel blow           nevada mines in new york   g   m   marshall  sheba hurs and amos h         rose  who left san francisco last july for new york city  with ores        from mines in pine wood district  humboldt county  and on the reese        river range  have disposed of a mine containing six thousand feet        and called the pine mountains consolidated  for the sum of                     the stamps on the deed  which is now on its way to        humboldt county  from new york  for record  amounted to                which is said to be the largest amount of stamps ever placed on one        document   a working capital of            has been paid into the        treasury  and machinery has already been purchased for a large        quartz mill  which will be put up as soon as possible   the stock in        this company is all full paid and entirely unassessable   the ores        of the mines in this district somewhat resemble those of the sheba        mine in humboldt   sheba hurst  the discoverer of the mines  with        his friends corralled all the best leads and all the land and timber        they desired before making public their whereabouts   ores from        there  assayed in this city  showed them to be exceedingly rich in        silver and gold  silver predominating   there is an abundance of        wood and water in the district   we are glad to know that new york        capital has been enlisted in the development of the mines of this        region   having seen the ores and assays  we are satisfied that the        mines of the district are very valuable  anything but wild cat     once more native imbecility had carried the day  and i had lost a  million   it was the  blind lead  over again     let us not dwell on this miserable matter   if i were inventing these  things  i could be wonderfully humorous over them  but they are too true  to be talked of with hearty levity  even at this distant day   true  and  yet not exactly as given in the above figures  possibly   i saw marshall   months afterward  and although he had plenty of money he did not claim to  have captured an entire million   in fact i gathered that he had not then  received           beyond that figure his fortune appeared to consist of  uncertain vast expectations rather than prodigious certainties   however   when the above item appeared in print i put full faith in it  and  incontinently wilted and went to seed under it   suffice it that i so  lost heart  and so yielded myself up to repinings and sighings and  foolish regrets  that i neglected my duties and became about worthless   as a reporter for a brisk newspaper   and at last one of the proprietors  took me aside  with a charity i still remember with considerable respect   and gave me an opportunity to resign my berth and so save myself the  disgrace of a dismissal           chapter lix     for a time i wrote literary screeds for the golden era  c  h  webb had  established a very excellent literary weekly called the californian  but  high merit was no guaranty of success  it languished  and he sold out to  three printers  and bret harte became editor at     a week  and i was  employed to contribute an article a week at       but the journal still  languished  and the printers sold out to captain ogden  a rich man and a  pleasant gentleman who chose to amuse himself with such an expensive  luxury without much caring about the cost of it   when he grew tired of  the novelty  he re sold to the printers  the paper presently died a  peaceful death  and i was out of work again   i would not mention these  things but for the fact that they so aptly illustrate the ups and downs  that characterize life on the pacific coast   a man could hardly stumble  into such a variety of queer vicissitudes in any other country     for two months my sole occupation was avoiding acquaintances  for during  that time i did not earn a penny  or buy an article of any kind  or pay  my board   i became a very adept at  slinking    i slunk from back street  to back street  i slunk away from approaching faces that looked familiar   i slunk to my meals  ate them humbly and with a mute apology for every  mouthful i robbed my generous landlady of  and at midnight  after  wanderings that were but slinkings away from cheerfulness and light  i  slunk to my bed   i felt meaner  and lowlier and more despicable than the  worms   during all this time i had but one piece of money  a silver ten  cent piece  and i held to it and would not spend it on any account  lest  the consciousness coming strong upon me that i was entirely penniless   might suggest suicide   i had pawned every thing but the clothes i had  on  so i clung to my dime desperately  till it was smooth with handling     however  i am forgetting   i did have one other occupation beside that of   slinking    it was the entertaining of a collector  and being  entertained by him   who had in his hands the virginia banker s bill for  forty six dollars which i had loaned my schoolmate  the  prodigal    this  man used to call regularly once a week and dun me  and sometimes oftener   he did it from sheer force of habit  for he knew he could get nothing   he would get out his bill  calculate the interest for me  at five per  cent a month  and show me clearly that there was no attempt at fraud in  it and no mistakes  and then plead  and argue and dun with all his might  for any sum  any little trifle  even a dollar  even half a dollar  on  account   then his duty was accomplished and his conscience free   he  immediately dropped the subject there always  got out a couple of cigars  and divided  put his feet in the window  and then we would have a long   luxurious talk about everything and everybody  and he would furnish me a  world of curious dunning adventures out of the ample store in his memory   by and by he would clap his hat on his head  shake hands and say briskly      well  business is business  can t stay with you always    and was off in  a second     the idea of pining for a dun   and yet i used to long for him to come   and would get as uneasy as any mother if the day went by without his  visit  when i was expecting him   but he never collected that bill  at  last nor any part of it   i lived to pay it to the banker myself     misery loves company   now and then at night  in out of the way  dimly  lighted places  i found myself happening on another child of misfortune   he looked so seedy and forlorn  so homeless and friendless and forsaken   that i yearned toward him as a brother   i wanted to claim kinship with  him and go about and enjoy our wretchedness together   the drawing toward  each other must have been mutual  at any rate we got to falling together  oftener  though still seemingly by accident  and although we did not  speak or evince any recognition  i think the dull anxiety passed out of  both of us when we saw each other  and then for several hours we would  idle along contentedly  wide apart  and glancing furtively in at home  lights and fireside gatherings  out of the night shadows  and very much  enjoying our dumb companionship     finally we spoke  and were inseparable after that   for our woes were  identical  almost   he had been a reporter too  and lost his berth  and  this was his experience  as nearly as i can recollect it   after losing  his berth he had gone down  down  down  with never a halt  from a  boarding house on russian hill to a boarding house in kearney street   from thence to dupont  from thence to a low sailor den  and from thence  to lodgings in goods boxes and empty hogsheads near the wharves   then   for a while  he had gained a meagre living by sewing up bursted sacks of  grain on the piers  when that failed he had found food here and there as  chance threw it in his way   he had ceased to show his face in daylight   now  for a reporter knows everybody  rich and poor  high and low  and  cannot well avoid familiar faces in the broad light of day     this mendicant blucher  i call him that for convenience  was a splendid  creature   he was full of hope  pluck and philosophy  he was well read  and a man of cultivated taste  he had a bright wit and was a master of  satire  his kindliness and his generous spirit made him royal in my eyes  and changed his curb stone seat to a throne and his damaged hat to a  crown     he had an adventure  once  which sticks fast in my memory as the most  pleasantly grotesque that ever touched my sympathies   he had been  without a penny for two months   he had shirked about obscure streets   among friendly dim lights  till the thing had become second nature to  him   but at last he was driven abroad in daylight   the cause was  sufficient  he had not tasted food for forty eight hours  and he could  not endure the misery of his hunger in idle hiding   he came along a back  street  glowering at the loaves in bake shop windows  and feeling that he  could trade his life away for a morsel to eat   the sight of the bread  doubled his hunger  but it was good to look at it  any how  and imagine  what one might do if one only had it     presently  in the middle of the street he saw a shining spot  looked  again  did not  and could not  believe his eyes  turned away  to try  them  then looked again   it was a verity  no vain  hunger inspired  delusion  it was a silver dime     he snatched it  gloated over it  doubted it  bit it  found it genuine    choked his heart down  and smothered a halleluiah   then he looked  around  saw that nobody was looking at him  threw the dime down where it  was before  walked away a few steps  and approached again  pretending he  did not know it was there  so that he could re enjoy the luxury of  finding it   he walked around it  viewing it from different points  then  sauntered about with his hands in his pockets  looking up at the signs  and now and then glancing at it and feeling the old thrill again   finally he took it up  and went away  fondling it in his pocket   he  idled through unfrequented streets  stopping in doorways and corners to  take it out and look at it   by and by he went home to his lodgings  an  empty queens ware hogshead   and employed himself till night trying to  make up his mind what to buy with it   but it was hard to do   to get the  most for it was the idea   he knew that at the miner s restaurant he  could get a plate of beans and a piece of bread for ten cents  or a  fish ball and some few trifles  but they gave  no bread with one  fish ball  there   at french pete s he could get a veal cutlet  plain   and some radishes and bread  for ten cents  or a cup of coffee  a pint at  least  and a slice of bread  but the slice was not thick enough by the  eighth of an inch  and sometimes they were still more criminal than that  in the cutting of it   at seven o clock his hunger was wolfish  and still  his mind was not made up   he turned out and went up merchant street   still ciphering  and chewing a bit of stick  as is the way of starving  men     he passed before the lights of martin s restaurant  the most aristocratic  in the city  and stopped   it was a place where he had often dined  in  better days  and martin knew him well   standing aside  just out of the  range of the light  he worshiped the quails and steaks in the show  window  and imagined that may be the fairy times were not gone yet and  some prince in disguise would come along presently and tell him to go in  there and take whatever he wanted   he chewed his stick with a hungry  interest as he warmed to his subject   just at this juncture he was  conscious of some one at his side  sure enough  and then a finger touched  his arm   he looked up  over his shoulder  and saw an apparition  a very  allegory of hunger   it was a man six feet high  gaunt  unshaven  hung  with rags  with a haggard face and sunken cheeks  and eyes that pleaded  piteously   this phantom said      come with me  please      he locked his arm in blucher s and walked up the street to where the  passengers were few and the light not strong  and then facing about  put  out his hands in a beseeching way  and said      friend  stranger  look at me   life is easy to you  you go about  placid  and content  as i did once  in my day  you have been in there  and eaten  your sumptuous supper  and picked your teeth  and hummed your tune  and  thought your pleasant thoughts  and said to yourself it is a good world    but you ve never suffered   you don t know what trouble is  you don t  know what misery is  nor hunger   look at me   stranger have pity on a  poor friendless  homeless dog   as god is my judge  i have not tasted  food for eight and forty hours   look in my eyes and see if i lie   give  me the least trifle in the world to keep me from starving  anything    twenty five cents   do it  stranger  do it  please   it will be nothing  to you  but life to me   do it  and i will go down on my knees and lick  the dust before you   i will kiss your footprints  i will worship the  very ground you walk on   only twenty five cents   i am famishing    perishing  starving by inches   for god s sake don t desert me      blucher was bewildered  and touched  too  stirred to the depths   he  reflected   thought again   then an idea struck him  and he said      come with me      he took the outcast s arm  walked him down to martin s restaurant  seated  him at a marble table  placed the bill of fare before him  and said      order what you want  friend   charge it to me  mr  martin       all right  mr  blucher   said martin     then blucher stepped back and leaned against the counter and watched the  man stow away cargo after cargo of buckwheat cakes at seventy five cents  a plate  cup after cup of coffee  and porter house steaks worth two  dollars apiece  and when six dollars and a half s worth of destruction  had been accomplished  and the stranger s hunger appeased  blucher went  down to french pete s  bought a veal cutlet plain  a slice of bread  and  three radishes  with his dime  and set to and feasted like a king     take the episode all around  it was as odd as any that can be culled from  the myriad curiosities of californian life  perhaps           chapter lx     by and by  an old friend of mine  a miner  came down from one of the  decayed mining camps of tuolumne  california  and i went back with him   we lived in a small cabin on a verdant hillside  and there were not five  other cabins in view over the wide expanse of hill and forest   yet a  flourishing city of two or three thousand population had occupied this  grassy dead solitude during the flush times of twelve or fifteen years  before  and where our cabin stood had once been the heart of the teeming  hive  the centre of the city   when the mines gave out the town fell into  decay  and in a few years wholly disappeared  streets  dwellings  shops   everything  and left no sign   the grassy slopes were as green and smooth  and desolate of life as if they had never been disturbed   the mere  handful of miners still remaining  had seen the town spring up spread   grow and flourish in its pride  and they had seen it sicken and die  and  pass away like a dream   with it their hopes had died  and their zest of  life   they had long ago resigned themselves to their exile  and ceased  to correspond with their distant friends or turn longing eyes toward  their early homes   they had accepted banishment  forgotten the world and  been forgotten of the world   they were far from telegraphs and  railroads  and they stood  as it were  in a living grave  dead to the  events that stirred the globe s great populations  dead to the common  interests of men  isolated and outcast from brotherhood with their kind   it was the most singular  and almost the most touching and melancholy  exile that fancy can imagine   one of my associates in this locality  for  two or three months  was a man who had had a university education  but  now for eighteen years he had decayed there by inches  a bearded   rough clad  clay stained miner  and at times  among his sighings and  soliloquizings  he unconsciously interjected vaguely remembered latin and  greek sentences  dead and musty tongues  meet vehicles for the thoughts  of one whose dreams were all of the past  whose life was a failure  a  tired man  burdened with the present  and indifferent to the future  a  man without ties  hopes  interests  waiting for rest and the end     in that one little corner of california is found a species of mining  which is seldom or never mentioned in print   it is called  pocket  mining  and i am not aware that any of it is done outside of that little  corner   the gold is not evenly distributed through the surface dirt  as  in ordinary placer mines  but is collected in little spots  and they are  very wide apart and exceedingly hard to find  but when you do find one  you reap a rich and sudden harvest   there are not now more than twenty  pocket miners in that entire little region   i think i know every one of  them personally   i have known one of them to hunt patiently about the  hill sides every day for eight months without finding gold enough to make  a snuff box  his grocery bill running up relentlessly all the time  and  then find a pocket and take out of it two thousand dollars in two dips of  his shovel   i have known him to take out three thousand dollars in two  hours  and go and pay up every cent of his indebtedness  then enter on a  dazzling spree that finished the last of his treasure before the night  was gone   and the next day he bought his groceries on credit as usual   and shouldered his pan and shovel and went off to the hills hunting  pockets again happy and content   this is the most fascinating of all the  different kinds of mining  and furnishes a very handsome percentage of  victims to the lunatic asylum     pocket hunting is an ingenious process   you take a spadeful of earth  from the hill side and put it in a large tin pan and dissolve and wash it  gradually away till nothing is left but a teaspoonful of fine sediment   whatever gold was in that earth has remained  because  being the  heaviest  it has sought the bottom   among the sediment you will find  half a dozen yellow particles no larger than pin heads   you are  delighted   you move off to one side and wash another pan   if you find  gold again  you move to one side further  and wash a third pan   if you  find no gold this time  you are delighted again  because you know you are  on the right scent     you lay an imaginary plan  shaped like a fan  with its handle up the  hill  for just where the end of the handle is  you argue that the rich  deposit lies hidden  whose vagrant grains of gold have escaped and been  washed down the hill  spreading farther and farther apart as they  wandered   and so you proceed up the hill  washing the earth and  narrowing your lines every time the absence of gold in the pan shows that  you are outside the spread of the fan  and at last  twenty yards up the  hill your lines have converged to a point  a single foot from that point  you cannot find any gold   your breath comes short and quick  you are  feverish with excitement  the dinner bell may ring its clapper off  you  pay no attention  friends may die  weddings transpire  houses burn down   they are nothing to you  you sweat and dig and delve with a frantic  interest  and all at once you strike it   up comes a spadeful of earth  and quartz that is all lovely with soiled lumps and leaves and sprays of  gold   sometimes that one spadeful is all         sometimes the nest  contains          and it takes you three or four days to get it all out   the pocket miners tell of one nest that yielded         and two men  exhausted it in two weeks  and then sold the ground for         to a  party who never got      out of it afterward     the hogs are good pocket hunters   all the summer they root around the  bushes  and turn up a thousand little piles of dirt  and then the miners  long for the rains  for the rains beat upon these little piles and wash  them down and expose the gold  possibly right over a pocket   two pockets  were found in this way by the same man in one day   one had        in it  and the other          that man could appreciate it  for he hadn t had a  cent for about a year     in tuolumne lived two miners who used to go to the neighboring village in  the afternoon and return every night with household supplies   part of  the distance they traversed a trail  and nearly always sat down to rest  on a great boulder that lay beside the path   in the course of thirteen  years they had worn that boulder tolerably smooth  sitting on it   by and  by two vagrant mexicans came along and occupied the seat   they began to  amuse themselves by chipping off flakes from the boulder with a  sledge hammer   they examined one of these flakes and found it rich with  gold  that boulder paid them      afterward   but the aggravating  circumstance was that these  greasers  knew that there must be more gold  where that boulder came from  and so they went panning up the hill and  found what was probably the richest pocket that region has yet produced   it took three months to exhaust it  and it yielded            the two  american miners who used to sit on the boulder are poor yet  and they  take turn about in getting up early in the morning to curse those  mexicans  and when it comes down to pure ornamental cursing  the native  american is gifted above the sons of men     i have dwelt at some length upon this matter of pocket mining because it  is a subject that is seldom referred to in print  and therefore i judged  that it would have for the reader that interest which naturally attaches  to novelty             painted stucco walls of the houses  reflect the soft  glowing colour of the west  in the courtyard of the hotel  du grand cerf  too  every thing is bathed in this beautiful light and the  double line of closely trimmed laurels has not yet been deserted by the  golden flood  but evreux does not really require a fine evening to make it  attractive  although there is no town in existence that is not improved  under such conditions  with the magnificent cathedral  the belfry  the  norman church of st taurin and the museum  besides many quaint peeps by the  much sub divided river iton that flows through the town  there is  sufficient to interest one even on the dullest of dull days     of all the cathedral interiors in normandy there are none that possess a  finer or more perfectly proportioned nave than evreux  and if i were asked  to point out the two most impressive interiors of the churches in this  division of france i should couple the cathedral at evreux with st ouen at  rouen     it was our own henry i  who having destroyed the previous building set to  work to build a new one and it is his nave that we see to day  the whole  cathedral has since that time been made to reflect the changing ideals of  the seven centuries that have passed  the west front belongs entirely to  the renaissance period and the north transept is in the flamboyant style of  the fifteenth century so much in evidence in normandy and so infrequent in  england     the central tower with its tall steeple now encased in scaffolding was  built in      by cardinal balue  bishop of evreux and inventor of the  fearful wooden cages in one of which the prisoner dubourg died at mont st  michel     in most of the windows there is old and richly coloured glass  those in the  chancel have stronger tones  but they all transform the shafts of light  into gorgeous rainbow effects which stand out in wonderful contrast to the  delicate  creamy white of the stone work  pale blue banners are suspended  in the chancel  and the groining above is coloured on each side of the  bosses for a short distance  so that as one looks up the great sweep of the  nave  the banners and the brilliant fifteenth century glass appear as vivid  patches of colour beyond the uniform  creamy grey on either side  the  norman towers at the west end of the cathedral are completely hidden in the  mask of classical work planted on top of the older stone work in the  sixteenth century  and more recent restoration has altered some of the  other features of the exterior  at the present day the process of  restoration still goes on  but the faults of our grandfathers fortunately  are not repeated     leaving the place parvis by the rue de l horloge you come to the great open  space in front of the hotel de ville and the theatre with the museum on the  right  in which there are several roman remains discovered at vieil evreux   among them being a bronze statue of jupiter stator  on the opposite side of  the place stands the beautiful town belfry built at the end of the  fifteenth century  there was an earlier one before that time  but i do not  know whether it had been destroyed during the wars with the english  or  whether the people of evreux merely raised the present graceful tower in  place of the older one with a view to beautifying the town  the bell  which  was cast in      may have hung in the former structure  and there is some  fascination in hearing its notes when one realises how these same sound  waves have fallen on the ears of the long procession of players who have  performed their parts within its hearing  a branch of the iton runs past  the foot of the tower in canal fashion  it is backed by old houses and  crossed by many a bridge  and helps to build up a suitable foreground to  the beautiful old belfry  which seems to look across to the brand new hotel  de ville with an injured expression  from the boulevard chambaudouin there  is a good view of one side of the bishop s palace which lies on the south  side of the cathedral  and is joined to it by a gallery and the remains of  the cloister  the walls are strongly fortified  and in front of them runs a  branch of one of the canals of the iton  that must have originally served  as a moat     out towards the long straight avenue that runs out of the town in the  direction of caen  there may be seen the norman church of st taurin  it is  all that is left of the benedictine abbey that once stood here  many people  who explore this interesting church fail to see the silver gilt reliquary  of the twelfth century that is shown to visitors who make the necessary  inquiries  the richness of its enamels and the elaborate ornamentation  studded with imitation gems that have replaced the real ones  makes this  casket almost unique     many scenes from the life of the saint are shown in the windows of the  choir of the church  they are really most interesting  and the glass is  very beautiful  the south door must have been crowded with the most  elaborate ornament  but the delicately carved stone work has been hacked  away and the thin pillars replaced by crude  uncarved chunks of stone   there is norman arcading outside the north transept as well as just above  the floor in the north aisle  st taurin is a somewhat dilapidated and  cob webby church  but it is certainly one of the interesting features of  evreux     instead of keeping on the road to caen after reaching the end of the great  avenue just mentioned  we turn towards the south and soon enter pretty  pastoral scenery  the cottages are almost in every instance thatched  with  ridges plastered over with a kind of cobb mud  in the cracks in this  curious ridging  grass seeds and all sorts of wild flowers are soon  deposited  so that upon the roof of nearly every cottage there is a  luxuriant growth of grass and flowers  in some cases yellow irises alone  ornament the roofs  and they frequently grow on the tops of the walls that  are treated in a similar fashion  a few miles out of evreux you pass a  hamlet with a quaint little church built right upon the roadway with no  churchyard or wall of any description  a few broken gravestones of quite  recent date litter the narrow  dusty space between the north side of the  church and the roadway  inside there is an untidy aspect to everything  but  there are some windows containing very fine thirteenth century glass which  the genial old cure shows with great delight  for it is said that they were  intended for the cathedral at evreux  but by some chance remained in this  obscure hamlet  the cure also points out the damage done to the windows by   socialistes  at a recent date     by the roadside towards conches  there are magpies everywhere  punctuated  by yellow hammers and nightingales  the cottages have thatch of a very deep  brown colour over the hipped roofs  closely resembling those in the  out of the way parts of sussex  it a beautiful country  and the  delightfully situated town of conches at the edge of its forest is well  matched with its surroundings     in the middle of the day the inhabitants seem to entirely disappear from  the sunny street  and everything has a placid and reposeful appearance as  though the place revelled in its quaintness  backed by the dense masses of  forest there is a sloping green where an avenue of great chestnuts tower  above the long  low roof of the timber framed cattle shelter  on the  highest part of the hill stands the castle  whose round  central tower  shows above the trees that grow thickly on the slopes of the hill  close to  the castle is the graceful church  and beyond are the clustered roofs of  the houses  a viaduct runs full tilt against the hill nearly beneath the  church  and then the railway pierces the hill on its way towards bernay   the tall spire of the church of st foy is comparatively new  for the whole  structure was rebuilt in the fifteenth century  but its stained glass is of  exceptional interest  its richness of colour and the interest of the  subjects indicate some unusually gifted artist  and one is not surprised to  discover that they were designed by aldegrevers  who was trained by that  great master albrecht dyrer  altogether there are twenty one of these  beautiful windows  seven occupy the eastern end of the apse and give scenes  taken from the life of st foy     you can reach the castle by passing through the quaint archway of the hotel  de ville  and then passing through the shady public garden you plunge into  the dry moat that surrounds the fortified mound  there is not very much to  see but what appears in a distant view of the town  and in many ways the  outside groupings of the worn ruin and the church roofs and spire above the  houses are better than the scenes in the town itself  the hotel croix  blanche is a pleasant little house for dejeuner  everything is extremely  simple and typical of the family methods of the small french inn  where  excellent cooking goes along with many primitive usages  the cool  salle a manger is reached through the general living room and kitchen   which is largely filled with the table where you may see the proprietor  and his family partaking of their own meals  there seems no room to cook  anything at all  and yet when you are seated in the next room the  daughter of the family  an attractive and neatly dressed girl   gracefully serves the most admirable courses  worthy and perhaps better  than what one may expect to obtain in the best hotel in rouen     there is a road that passes right through the forest of conches towards  rugles  but that must be left for another occasion if we are to see  anything of the charms of beaumont le roger  the perfectly situated little  town that lies half way between conches and bernay     the long street of the town containing some very charming peeps as you go  towards the church is really a terrace on the limestone hills that rises  behind the houses on the right  and falls steeply on the left  spaces  between the houses and narrow turnings give glimpses of the rich green  country down below  from the lower level you see the rocky ridge above  clothed in a profusion of trees  the most perfect picture in the town is  from the river bank just by the bridge  in the foreground is the  mirror like stream that gives its own rendering of the scene that is built  up above it  leaning upon a parapet of the bridge is a man with a rod who  is causing tragedies in the life that teems beneath the glassy surface   beyond the bridge appear some quaint red roofs with one tower like house  with an overhanging upper storey  higher up comes the precipitous hill  divided into terraces by the huge walls that surround the abbey buildings   and still higher  but much below the highest part of the hill  are the  picturesque ruins of the abbey  on the summit of the ridge dominating all  are the insignificant remains of the castle built by roger a la barbe   whose name survives in that of the town  his family were the founders of  the abbey that flourished for several centuries  but finally  about a  hundred years ago  the buildings were converted to the uses of a factory   spinning and weaving might have still been going on but for a big fire that  destroyed the whole place  there was  however  a considerably more complete  series of buildings left than we can see to day  but scarcely more than  fifty years ago the place was largely demolished for building materials   the view from the river rille is therefore the best the ruin can boast  for  seen from that point the arches rise up against the green background as a  stately ruin  and the tangled mass of weeds and debris are invisible  the  entrance is most inviting  it is down at the foot of the cliff  and the  archway with the steep ascent inside suggests all sorts of delights beyond   as it stands there just by the main street of the town  i was sorry  afterwards  that i had accepted that hospitality  for with the exception of  a group of merry children playing in an orchard and some big caves hollowed  out of the foot of the cliff that rises still higher  i saw nothing but a  jungle of nettles  this warning should not  however  suggest that  beaumont le roger is a poor place to visit  not only is it a charming  i  may say a fascinating spot to visit  but it is also a place in which to  stay  for the longer you remain there the less do you like the idea of  leaving  the church of st nicholas standing in the main street where it  becomes much wider and forms a small place  is a beautiful old building  whose mellow colours on stone work and tiles glow vividly on a sunny  afternoon  there is a great stone wall forming the side of the rocky  platform that supports the building and the entrance is by steps that lead  up to the west end  the tower belongs to the flamboyant period and high up  on its parapet you may see a small statue of regulus who does duty as a   jack smite the clock   just by the porch there leans against a wall a most  ponderous grave slab which was made for the tomb of jehan du moustier a  soldier of the fourteenth century who fought for that charles of navarre  who was surnamed  the bad   the classic additions to the western part of  the church seem strangely out of sympathy with the gargoyles overhead and  the thirteenth century arcades of the nave  but this mixing up of styles is  really more incongruous in description than in reality     when you have decided to leave beaumont le roger and have passed across the  old bridge and out into the well watered plain  the position of the little  town suggests that of the village of pulborough in sussex  where a road  goes downhill to a bridge and then crosses the rich meadowland where the  river arun winds among the pastures in just the same fashion as the rille     at a bend in the road to bernay stands the village of serquigny  it is just  at the edge of the forest of beaumont which we have been skirting  and  besides having a church partially belonging to the twelfth century it has  traces of a roman camp  all the rest of the way to bernay the road follows  the railway and the river charentonne until the long  and when you are  looking out for the hotel  seemingly endless street of bernay is reached   after the wonderful combination of charms that are flaunted by  beaumont le roger it is possible to grumble at the plainer features of  bernay  but there is really no reason to hurry out of the town for there is  much quaint architecture to be seen  and near the hotel du lion d or there  is a house built right over the street resting on solid wooden posts  but  more interesting than the domestic architecture are the remains of the  abbey founded by judith of brittany very early in the eleventh century for  it is probably one of the oldest romanesque remains in normandy  the church  is cut up into various rooms and shops at the choir end  and there has been  much indiscriminate ill treatment of the ancient stone work  much of the  structure  including the plain round arches and square columns  is of the  very earliest norman period  having been built in the first half of the  eleventh century  but in later times classic ornament was added to the work  of those shadowy times when the kingdom of normandy had not long been  established  so much alteration in the styles of decoration has taken place  in the building that it is possible to be certain of the date of only some  portions of the structure  the hotel de ville now occupies part of the  abbey buildings     at the eastern side of the town stands st croix  a fifteenth century church  with a most spacious interior  there is much beautiful glass dating from  three hundred years ago in the windows of the nave and transepts  but  perhaps the feature which will be remembered most when other impressions  have vanished  will be the finely carved statues belonging to the  fourteenth century which were brought here from the abbey of bec  the south  transept contains a monument to guillaume arvilarensis  an abbot of bec who  died in       upon the great altar which is believed to have been brought  from the abbey of bec  there are eight marble columns surrounding a small  white marble figure of the child jesus     another church at bernay is that of notre dame de la couture  it has much  fourteenth century work and behind the high altar there are five chapels   the centre one containing a copy of the  sacred image  of notre dame which  stands by the column immediately to the right of the entrance  much more  could be said of these three churches with their various styles of  architecture extending from the very earliest period down to the classic  work of the seventeenth century  but this is not the place for intricate  descriptions of architectural detail which are chiefly useful in books  which are intended for carrying from place to place           chapter v      concerning lisieux and the romantic town of falaise    lisieux is so rich in the curious timber framed houses of the middle and  later ages that there are some examples actually visible immediately  outside the railway station whereas in most cases one usually finds an  aggregation of uninteresting modern buildings  as you go towards the centre  of the town the old houses  which have only been dotted about here and  there  join hands and form whole streets of the most romantic and almost  stage like picturesqueness  the narrow street illustrated here is the rue  aux fevres  its houses are astonishingly fine  and it forms  especially in  the evening  a background suitable for any of the stirring scenes that took  place in such grand old towns as lisieux in medieval days  this street is  however  only one of several that reek of history  in the rue des  boucheries and in the grande rue there are lovely overhanging gables and  curious timber framing that is now at any angle but what was originally  intended  there is really so much individual quaintness in these houses  that they deserve infinitely more than the scurry past them which so  frequently is all their attractions obtain  the narrowness and fustiness of  the rue aux fevres certainly hinder you from spending much time in  examining the houses but there are two which deserve a few minutes   individual attention  one which has a very wide gable and the upper floors  boarded is believed to be of very great antiquity  dating from as early a  period as the thirteenth century  it is numbered thirty three  and must not  be confused with the richly ornamented manoir de francois i  the timber  work of this house  especially of the two lower floors is covered with  elaborate carving including curious animals and quaint little figures  and  also the salamander of the royal house  for this reason the photographs  sold in the shops label the house  manoir de la salamandre   the place is  now fast going to ruin  a most pitiable sight and i for one  would prefer  to see the place restored rather than it should be allowed to become so  hopelessly dilapidated and rotten that the question of its preservation  should come to be considered lightly     if the town authorities of lisieux chose to do so  they could encourage the  townsfolk to enrich many of their streets by a judicious flaking off of the  plaster which in so many cases tries to hide all the pleasant features of  houses that have seen at least three centuries  but this sort of work when  in the hands of only partially educated folk is liable to produce a worse  state of affairs than if things had been left untouched  an example of what  over restoration can do  may be seen when we reach the beautiful old inn at  dives     the two churches of lisieux are well fitted to their surroundings  and  although st jacques has no graceful tower or fleche  the quaintness of its  shingled belfry makes up for the lack of the more stately towers of st  pierre  where the stone work has stopped short the buttresses are roofed  with the quaintest semi circular caps  and over the clock there are two  more odd looking pepper boxes perched upon the steep slope that projects  from the square belfry  over all there is a low pyramidal roof  stained  with orange lichen and making a great contrast in colour to the  weather beaten stone work down below  there are small patches of tiled  roofing to the buttresses at the western ends of the aisles and these also  add colour to this picturesque building  the great double flight of stone  steps which lead to the imposing western door have balustrades filled with  flamboyant tracery  but although the church is built up in this way  the  floor in the interior is not level  for it slopes gently up towards the  east  the building was commenced during the reign of louis xii  and not  finished until nearly the end of the reign of francois i  it is therefore  coeval with that richly carved house in the rue aux fevres  along the sides  of the church there project a double row of thirsty looking gargoyles  the  upper ones having their shoulders supported by the mass of masonry  supporting the flying buttresses  the interior is richer than the exterior   and you may see on some of the pillars remains of sixteenth century  paintings  a picture dating from      occupies a position in the chapel of  st ursin in the south aisle  it shows the relic of the saint being brought  to lisieux in          the wide and sunny place thiers is dominated by the great church of st  pierre  which was left practically in its present form in the year        the first church was begun some years before the conquest of england but  about a century later it suffered the fate of bayeux being burnt down in        it was reconstructed soon afterwards and shows to day the first  period of gothic architecture that became prevalent in normandy  only the  north tower dates from this period  the other one had to be rebuilt during  the reign of henri iii  and the spire only made its appearance in the  seventeenth century  the lady chapel is of particular interest owing to the  statement that it was built by that bishop of beauvais who took such a  prominent part in the trial of joan of arc  the main arches over the big  west door are now bare of carving or ornament and the hotel de ville is  built right up against the north west corner  but despite this st pierre  has the most imposing and stately appearance  and there are many features  such as the curious turrets of the south transept that impress themselves  on the memory more than some of the other churches we have seen     lisieux is one of those cheerful towns that appear always clean and bright  under the dullest skies  so that when the sun shines every view seems  freshly painted and blazing with colour  the freshness of the atmosphere   too  is seldom tainted with those peculiar odours that some french towns  produce with such enormous prodigality  and lisieux may therefore claim a  further point in its favour     it is generally a wide  hedgeless stretch of country that lies between  lisieux and falaise  but for the first ten miles there are big farm houses  with timber framed barns and many orchards bearing a profusion of blossom  near the roadside  a small farm perched above the road and quite out of  sight  invites the thirsty passer by to turn aside up a steep path to  partake of cider or coffee  it is a simple  almost bare room where the  refreshment is served  but its quaintness and shadowy coolness are most  refreshing  the fireplace has an open hearth with a wood fire which can  soon be blown into a blaze by the big bellows that hang against the chimney  corner  a table by one of the windows is generally occupied in her spare  moments by the farmer s pretty daughter who puts aside her knitting to  fetch the cider or to blow up the fire for coffee  they are a most genial  family and seem to find infinite delight in plying english folk with  questions for i imagine that not many find their way to this sequestered  corner among waving trees and lovely orchards     a sudden descent before reaching st pierre sur dives gives a great view  over the level country below where everything is brilliantly green and  garden like  the village first shows its imposing church through the trees  of a straight avenue leading towards the village which also possesses a  fine market hall that must be at least six hundred years old  the church is  now undergoing restoration externally  but by dodging the falling cement  dust you may go inside  perhaps to be disappointed that there is not more  of the norman work that has been noticed in the southern tower that rises  above the entrance  the village  or it should really be called a small  town  for its population is over a thousand  has much in it that is  attractive and quaint  and it might gain more attention if everyone who  passes through its streets were not hurrying forward to falaise     the country now becomes a great plain  hedgeless  and at times almost  featureless  the sun in the afternoon throws the shadows of the roadside  trees at right angles  so that the road becomes divided into accurate  squares by the thin lines of shadow  the straight run from st pierre is  broken where the road crosses the dives  it is a pretty spot with a farm  a  manor house and a washing place for women just below the bridge  and then  follows more open road and more interminable perspectives cutting through  the open plain until  with considerable satisfaction  the great  thoroughfare from caen is joined and soon afterwards a glimpse of the  castle greets us as we enter falaise     there is something peculiarly fascinating about falaise  for it combines  many of the features that are sparingly distributed in other towns  its  position on a hill with deep valleys on all sides  its romantic castle  the  two beautiful churches and the splendid thirteenth century gateway  form  the best remembered attractions  but beyond these there are the hundred and  one pretty groupings of the cottages that crowd both banks of the little  river ante down in the valley under the awe inspiring castle     even then  no mention has been made of the ancient fronts that greet one in  many of the streets  and the charms of some of the sudden openings between  the houses that give views of the steep  wooded hollows that almost touch  the main street  have been slighted  a huge cube of solid masonry with a  great cylindrical tower alongside perched upon a mass of rock precipitous  on two sides is the distant view of the castle  and coming closer  although  you can see the buttresses that spring from the rocky foundations  the  description still holds good  you should see the fortress in the twilight  with a golden suffusion in the sky and strange  purplish shadows on the  castle walls  it then has much the appearance of one of those unassailable  strongholds where a beautiful princess is lying in captivity waiting for a  chivalrous knight who with a band of faithful men will attempt to scale the  inaccessible walls  under some skies  the castle assumes the character of  one of turner s impressions  half real and half imaginary  and under no  skies does this most formidable relic of feudal days ever lose its grand  and awesome aspect  the entrance is through a gateway  the porte st   nicolas  which was built in the thirteenth century  there you are taken in  hand by a pleasant concierge who will lead you first of all to the tour la  reine  where he will point out a great breach in the wall made by henri iv   when he successfully assaulted the castle after a bombardment with his  artillery which he had kept up for a week  this was in       and since then  no other fighting has taken place round these grand old walls  the ivy that  clings to the ruins and the avenue of limes that leads up to the great keep  are full of jackdaws which wheel round the rock in great flights  you have  a close view of the great tour talbot  and then pass through a small  doorway in the northern face of the citadel  inside  the appearance of the  walls reveals the restoration which has taken place within recent years   but this  fortunately  does not detract to any serious extent from the  interest of the whole place  up on the ramparts there are fine views over  the surrounding country  and immediately beneath the precipice below nestle  the picturesque  browny red roofs of the lower part of the town  just at  the foot of the castle rock there is still to be seen a tannery which is of  rather unusual interest in connection with the story of how robert le  diable was first struck by the charms of arlette  the beautiful daughter of  a tanner  the norman duke was supposed to have been looking over the  battlements when he saw this girl washing clothes in the river  and we are  told that owing to the warmth of the day she had drawn up her dress  so  that her feet  which are spoken of as being particularly beautiful were  revealed to his admiring gaze  arlette afterwards became the mother of  william the conqueror  and the room is pointed out in the south west corner  of the keep in which we are asked to believe that the conqueror of england  was born  it is  however  unfortunate for the legend that archaeologists do  not allow such an early date for the present castle  and thus we are not  even allowed to associate these ramparts with the legend just mentioned  it  must have been a strong building that preceded this present structure  for  during the eleventh century william the norman was often obliged to retreat  for safety to his impregnable birthplace  the tour talbot has below its  lowest floor what seems to be a dungeon  but it is said that prisoners were  not kept here  the place being used merely for storing food  the gloomy  chamber  however  is generally called an oubliette  above  there are other  floors  the top one having been used by the governor of the castle  in the  thickness of the wall there is a deep well which now contains no water  one  of the rooms in the keep is pointed out as that in which prince arthur was  kept in confinement  but although it is known that the unfortunate youth  was imprisoned in this castle  the selection of the room seems to be  somewhat arbitrary     in      the news of joan of arc s continued successes was brought to the  earl of salisbury who was then governor of falaise castle  and it was from  here that he started with an army to endeavour to stop that triumphal  progress  in      when the french completely overcame the numerous english  garrisons in the towns of normandy  falaise with its magnificent position  held out for some time  the defenders sallied out from the walls of the  town but were forced back again  and notwithstanding their courage  the  town capitulated to the duke of alencon s army at almost the same time as  avranches and a dozen other strongly defended towns  we can picture to  ourselves the men in glinting head pieces sallying from the splendid old  gateway known as the port des cordeliers  it has not lost its formidable  appearance even to day  though as you look through the archway the scene is  quiet enough  and the steep flight of outside steps leads up to scenes of  quiet domestic life  the windows overlook the narrow valley beneath where  the humble roofs of the cottages jostle one another for space  there are  many people who visit falaise who never have the curiosity to explore this  unusually pleasing part of the town  in the spring when the lilac bushes  add their brilliant colour to the russet brown tiles and soft creams of the  stone work  there are pictures on every side  looking in the cottages you  may see  generally within a few feet of the door  one of those ingenious  weaving machines that are worked with a treadle  and take up scarcely any  space at all  if you ask permission  the cottagers have not the slightest  objection to allowing you to watch them at their work  and when one sees  how rapidly great lengths of striped material grow under the revolving  metal framework  you wonder that falaise is not able to supply the demands  of the whole republic for this class of material     just by the hotel de ville and the church of la trinite stands the imposing  statue of william the conqueror  he is mounted on the enormous war horse of  the period and the whole effect is strong and spirited  the most notable  feature of the exterior of the church of la trinite is the curious  passage way that goes underneath the lady chapel behind the high altar  the  whole of the exterior is covered with rich carving  crocketed finials   innumerable gargoyles and the usual enriched mouldings of gothic  architecture  the charm of the interior is heightened if one enters in the  twilight when vespers are proceeding  there is just sufficient light to  show up the tracery of the windows and the massive pointed arches in the  choir  a few candles burn by the altar beyond the dark mass of figures  forming the congregation  a gregorian chant fills the building with its  solemn tones and the smoke of a swinging censer ascends in the shadowy  chancel  then  as the service proceeds  one candle above the altar seems to  suddenly ignite the next  and a line of fire travels all over the great  erection surrounding the figure of the virgin  leaving in its trail a blaze  of countless candles that throw out the details of the architecture in  strong relief  soon the collection is made  and as the priest passes round  the metal dish  he is followed by the cocked hatted official whose  appearance is so surprising to those who are not familiar with french  churches  as the priest passes the dish to each row the official brings his  metal headed staff down upon the pavement with a noisy bang that is  calculated to startle the unwary into dropping their money anywhere else  than in the plate  in time the bell rings beside the altar  and the priest  robed in white and gold elevates the host before the kneeling congregation   once more the man in the cocked hat becomes prominent as he steps into the  open space between the transepts and tolls the big bell in the tower above   then a smaller and much more cheerful bell is rung  and fearing the arrival  of another collecting priest we slip out of the swinging doors into the  twilight that has now almost been swallowed up in the gathering darkness     the consecration of the splendid norman church of st gervais took place in  the presence of henry i  but there is nothing particularly english in any  part of the exterior  the central tower has four tall and deeply recessed  arches  the middle ones contain windows  on each side  giving a rich  arcaded appearance  above  rises a tall pointed roof ornamented with four  odd looking dormers near the apex  every one remarks on their similarity to  dovecots and one almost imagines that they must have been built as a place  of shelter on stormy days for the great gilded cock that forms the weather  vane  the nave is still norman on the south side  plain round headed  windows lighting the clerestory  but the aisles were rebuilt in the  flamboyant period and present a rich mass of ornament in contrast to the  unadorned masonry of the nave  the western end until lately had to endure  the indignity of having its wall surfaces largely hidden by shops and  houses  these have now disappeared  but the stone work has not been  restored  and you may still see a section of the interior of the house that  formerly used the west end of the south aisle as one of its walls  you can  see where the staircases went  and you may notice also how wantonly these  domestic builders cut away the buttresses and architectural enrichments to  suit the convenience of their own needs     as you go from the market place along the street that runs from st gervais  to the suburb of guibray  the shops on the left are exchanged for a low  wall over which you see deep  grassy hollows that come right up to the edge  of the street  two fine houses  white shuttered and having the usual vacant  appearance  stand on steep slopes surrounded by great cedars of lebanon and  a copper beech     the church of guibray is chiefly norman  it is very white inside and there  is some round headed arcading in the aisles  the clustered columns of the  nave have simple  pointed arches  and there is a carved marble altarpiece  showing angels supporting the virgin who is gazing upwards  the aisles of  the chancel are restored norman  and the stone work is bright green just  above the floor through the dampness that seems to have defied the efforts  of the restorers           chapter vi      from argentan to avranches    between tall poplars whose stems are splotched with grey lichen and whose  feet are grown over with browny green moss  runs the road from falaise to  argentan  straight and white  with scarcely more than the slightest bend   for the whole eight miles  it is typical of the roads in this part of the  country and beyond the large stone four or five kilometres outside falaise   marking the boundary between calvados and orne  and the railway which one  passes soon afterwards  there is nothing to break the undulating monotony  of the boundless plain     we cannot all hope to have this somewhat dull stretch of country relieved  by any exciting event  but i can remember one spring afternoon being  overtaken by two mounted gendarmes in blue uniforms  galloping for their  very lives  i looked down the road into the cloud of dust raised by the  horses  hoofs  but the country on all sides lay calm and deserted  and i  was left in doubt as to the reason for this astonishing haste  half an hour  afterwards a group of people appeared in the distance  and on approaching  closer  they proved to be the two gendarmes leading their blown horses as  they walked beside a picturesque group of apparently simple peasants  the  three men wearing the typical soft  baggy cap and blue smock of the country  folk  the little group had a gloomy aspect  which was explained when i  noticed that the peasants were joined together by a bright steel chain   evidently something was very much amiss with one of the peaceful villages  lying near the road     after a time  at the end of the long white perspective  appear the towers  of the great church of st germain that dominate the town where henry ii   was staying when he made that rash exclamation concerning his  turbulent  priest   it was from argentan that those four knights set out for england  and canterbury to carry out the deed  for which henry lay in ashes for five  weeks in this very place  but there is little at the present time at  argentan to remind one that it is in any way associated with the murder of  becket  the castle that now exists is occupied by the courts of justice and  was partially built in the renaissance period  standing close to it  is an  exceedingly tall building with a great gable that suggests an  ecclesiastical origin  and on looking a little closer one soon discovers  blocked up gothic windows and others from which the tracery has been  hacked  this was the chapel of the castle which has been so completely  robbed of its sanctity that it is now cut up into small lodgings  and in  one of its diminutive shops  picture post cards of the town are sold     the ruins of the old castle are not very conspicuous  for in the  seventeenth century the great keep was demolished  there is still a fairly  noticeable round tower  the tour marguerite  which has a pointed roof above  its corbels  or perhaps they should be called machicolations  in the place  henri iv  stands a prominent building that projects over the pavement  supported by massive pointed arches  and with this building in the  foreground there is one of the best views of st germain that one can find  in the town  just before coming to the clock that is suspended over the  road by the porch of the church  there is a butcher s shop at the street  corner that has a piece of oak carving preserved on account of its interest  while the rest of the building has been made featureless with even plaster   the carving shows adam and eve standing on either side of a formal tree of  life  and the butcher  who is pleased to find a stranger who notices this  little curiosity  tells him with great pride that his house dates from the  fifteenth century  the porch of st germain is richly ornamented  but it  takes a second place to the south porch of the church of notre dame at  louviers and may perhaps seem scarcely worthy of comment after st maclou at  rouen  the structure as a whole was commenced in       and the last portion  of the work only dates from the middle of the seventeenth century  the  vaulting of the nave has a very new and well kept appearance and the side  altars  in contrast to so many of even the large churches  are almost  dignified in their somewhat restrained and classic style  the high altar is  a stupendous erection of two storeys with corinthian pillars  nine long   white  pendant banners are conspicuous on the walls of the chancel  the  great altars and the lesser ones that crowd the side chapels are subject to  the accumulation of dirt as everything else in buildings sacred or lay  and  at certain times of the day  a woman may be seen vigorously flapping the  brass candlesticks and countless altar ornaments with a big feather broom   on the north side of the chancel some of the windows have sections of old  painted glass  and in one of them there is part of a ship with men in  crow s nests backed by clouds  a really vigorous colour scheme     keeping to the high ground  there is to the south of this church an open  place  and beyond it there are some large barracks  where  on the other  side of a low wall may be seen the elaborately prepared steeple chase for  training soldiers to be able to surmount every conceivable form of  obstacle  awkward iron railings  wide ditches  walls of different  composition and varying height are frequently scaled  and it is practice of  this sort that has made the french soldier famous for the facility with  which he can storm fortifications  the river orne finds its way through the  lower part of the town and here there are to be found some of the most  pleasing bits of antique domestic architecture  one of the quaintest of  these built in      is the galleried building illustrated here  and from a  parallel street not many yards off there is a peep of a house that has been  built right over the stream which is scarcely less picturesque      illustration  a seventeenth century house at argentan     the church of st martin is passed on entering argentan from falaise  its  east end crowds right up against the pavement and it is somewhat unusual to  find the entrances at this portion of the building  the stained glass in  the choir of st martin is its most noticeable feature  the pictures showing  various scenes in the life of christ     as in all french towns argentan knows how to decorate on fete days  coming  out of the darkness of the church in the late twilight on one of these  occasions  i discovered that the town had suddenly become festooned with a  long perspective of arches stretching right away down the leafy avenue that  goes out of the town  to the north in one direction  and to st germain in  the other  the arches were entirely composed without a single exception of  large crimson red chinese lanterns  the effect was astonishingly good  but  despite all the decoration  the townsfolk seemed determined to preserve the  quiet of the sabbath  and although there were crowds everywhere  the only  noise that broke the stillness was that of the steam round about that had  been erected on a triangular patch of grass  the dark crowds of people  illuminated by flaring lights stood in perfect quiet as they watched the  great noisy mass of moving animals and boats  occupied almost entirely by  children  keep up its perpetual dazzle and roar  the fair  for there were  many side shows  was certainly quieter than any i have witnessed in  england     a long  straight road  poplar bordered and level  runs southwards from  argentan to mortree  a village of no importance except for the fact that  one must pass through it if one wishes to visit the beautiful chateau d o   this sixteenth century mansion like so many to be seen in this part of  france  is in a somewhat pathetic state of disrepair  but as far as one may  see from the exterior  it would not require any very great sum to  completely restore the broken stone work and other signs of decay  these   while perhaps adding to the picturesqueness of the buildings  do not bring  out that aspect of carefully preserved antiquity which is the charm of most  of the houses of this period in england  the great expanse of water in the  moat is very green and covered by large tracts of weed  but the water is  supplied by a spring  and fish thrive in it  the approach to the chateau  across the moat leads to an arched entrance through which you enter the  large courtyard overlooked on three sides by the richly ornamented  buildings  the fourth side being only protected from the moat by a low  wall  it would be hard to find a more charming spot than this with its  views across the moat to the gardens beyond  backed by great masses of  foliage     going on past mortree the main road will bring one after about eight miles  to the old town of alencon  which has been famed ever since the time of  louis xiv  for the lace which is even at the present day worked in the  villages of this neighbourhood  more especially at the hamlet of damigny   the cottagers use pure linen thread which is worth the almost incredible  sum of l    per lb  they work on parchment from patterns which are supplied  by the merchants in alencon  the women go on from early morning until the  light fails  and earn something about a shilling per day     the castle of alencon  built by henry i  in the twelfth century  was  pulled down with the exception of the keep  by the order of henry of  navarre  the famous contemporary of queen elizabeth  this keep is still in  existence  and is now used as a prison  near it is the palais de justice   standing where the other buildings were situated     the west porch of the church of notre dame is richly ornamented with  elaborate canopies  here and there with statues  one of these represents st  john  and it will be seen that he is standing with his face towards the  church  a legend states that this position was taken by the statue when the  church was being ransacked by protestants in the sixteenth century     another road from argentan is the great  route nationale  that runs in a  fairly direct line to granville  as one rides out of the town there is a  pretty view on looking back  of st germain standing on the slight eminence  above the orne  keeping along by that river the road touches it again at  the little town of ecouche  the old market hall standing on massive  pillars  is the most attractive feature of the place  its old tiled roof  and half timbered upper storey remind one forcibly of some of those  fortunate old towns in england that have preserved this feature  the church  has lost its original nave  and instead  there is a curious barn like  structure  built evidently with a view to economy  being scarcely more than  half the height of the original  the vacant space has been very roughly  filled up  and the numerous holes and crevices support a fine growth of  weeds  and a strong young tree has also taken root in the ramshackle stone  work  from the central tower  gargoyles grin above the elaborately carved  buttresses and finials in remarkable contrast to the jerry built addition      illustration  the old market house at ecouche     passing through rich country  you leave the valley of the orne  and on  both sides of the road are spread wide and fascinating views over the  orchard clad country that disappears in the distant blue of the horizon   wonderful patches of shadow  when large clouds are flying over the heavens   fall on this great tract of country and while in dull weather it may seem a  little monotonous  in days of sunshine and shade it is full of a haunting  beauty that is most remarkable     about seven miles from argentan one passes fromentelle  a quiet hamlet full  of thatched cottages and curious weathercocks  and then five miles further  on  having descended into the valley of the little river rouvre  briouze  is entered  here there is a wide and very extensive market place with  another quaint little structure  smaller than the one at ecouche  but  having a curious bell turret in the centre of the roof  on monday  which  is market day  briouze presents a most busy scene  and there are plenty of  opportunities of studying the genial looking country farmers  their wives   and the large carts in which they drive from the farms  in the midst of the  booths  you may see a bronze statue commemorating the  sapeurs  pompiers   and others of this little place who fell in          leaving the main road which goes on to flers  we may take the road to  domfront  which passes through three pretty villages and much pleasant  country  bellau  the first village  is full of quaint houses and charming  old world scenes  the church is right in the middle on an open space  without an enclosure of any description  standing with one s back to this  building  there is a pretty view down the road leading to the south  a  patch of blue distance appearing in the opening between the old gables  to  all those who may wish to either paint or photograph this charming scene  i  would recommend avoiding the hour in the afternoon when the children come  out of school  i was commencing a drawing one sunny afternoon  it must have  been about three o clock  and the place seemed almost deserted  indeed  i  had been looking for a country group of peasants to fill the great white  space of sunny road  when in twos and threes  the juvenile population  flooded out towards me  for some reason which i could not altogether  fathom  the boys arranged themselves in a long  regular line  occupying  exactly one half of the view  the remaining space being filled by an  equally long line of little girls  all my efforts failed to induce the  children to break up the arrangement they had made  they merely altered  their formation by advancing three or four paces nearer with almost  military precision  they were still standing in their unbroken rows when i  left the village     passing a curious roadside cross which bears the date      and a long latin  inscription splashed over with lichen  one arrives at la ferriere aux  etangs  a quaint village with a narrow and steep street containing one  conspicuously old  timber framed house  but it is scarcely necessary to  point out individual cottages in this part of normandy  for wherever one  looks  the cottages are covered with thick  purply grey thatch  and the  walls below are of grey wooden framework  filled in with plaster  generally  coloured a creamy white  when there are deep shadows under the eaves and  the fruit trees in blossom stand out against the dark thatch  one can  easily understand how captivating is the rural charm of this part of  normandy  gradually the road ascends  but no great views are apparent   although one is right above the beautiful valley of the varennes  until  quite near to domfront  then  suddenly there appears an enormous stretch of  slightly undulating country to the south and west  as far as one can see   the whole land seems to be covered by one vast forest     but though part of this is real forest land  much of it is composed of  orchards and hedgerow trees  which are planted so closely together that  at  a short distance  they assume the aspect of close growing woods  the first  impression of the great stretch of forest land does not lose its striking  aspect  even when one has explored the whole of the town  the road that  brings one into the old town runs along a ridge and after passing one of  the remains of the old gateways  it rises slightly to the highest part of  the mass of rock upon which domfront is perched  the streets are narrow and  parallel to accommodate themselves to the confined space within the walls   at the western end of the granite ridge  and separated from the town by a  narrow defile  stands all that is left of the castle  a massive but  somewhat shapeless ruin  at the western end of the ramparts  one looks down  a precipitous descent to the river varennes which has by some unusual  agency  cut itself a channel through the rocky ridge if it did not merely  occupy an existing gap  at the present time  besides the river  the road  and railway pass through the narrow gorge     the castle has one of those sites that appealed irresistibly to the warlike  barons of the eleventh century  in this case it was william i   duc de  belleme  who decided to raise a great fortress on this rock that he had  every reason to believe would prove an impregnable stronghold  but although  only built in       it was taken by duke william thirty seven years later   being one of the first brilliant feats by which william the norman showed  his strength outside his own duchy  a century or more later  henry ii    when at domfront  received the pope s nuncio by whom a reconciliation was  in some degree patched up between the king and becket  richard i  is known  to have been at the castle at various times  in the sixteenth century   a most thrilling siege was conducted during the period when catherine  de medicis was controlling the throne  a royalist force  numbering some  seven or eight thousand horse and foot  surrounded this formidable rock  which was defended by the calvinist comte de montgommery  with him was  another protestant  ambroise le balafre  who had made himself a despot  at domfront  but whose career was cut short by one of montgommery s men  with whom he had quarrelled  they buried him in the little church of  notre dame sur l eau  the wonderfully preserved norman building that one  sees beneath one s feet when standing on the ramparts of the castle  the  body  however  was not long allowed to remain there  for when the royal  army surrounded the castle they brought out the corpse and hung it in a  conspicuous place to annoy the besieged  like corfe castle in england  and  many other magnificently fortified strongholds  domfront was capable of  defence by a mere handful  in this case the original garrison consisted of  one hundred and fifty  and after many desertions the force was reduced to  less than fifty  a great breach had been made by the six pieces of  artillery placed on the hill on the opposite side of the gorge  and through  this the besiegers endeavoured to enter  the attenuated garrison  with  magnificent courage  held the breach after a most desperate and bloody  fight  but after all this display of courage  it was found impossible to  continue the defence  for by the next morning there were barely more than a  dozen men left to fight  finally montgommery was obliged to surrender  unconditionally  and not long afterwards he was executed in paris  you may  see the breach where this terrible fight took place at the present day  and  as you watch the curious effects of the blue shadows falling among the  forest trees that stretch away towards the south  you may feel that you are  looking over almost the same scene that was gazed upon by the notable  figures in history who have made their exits and entrances at domfront     so little has the church of notre dame sur l eau altered in its appearance  since it was built by the duc de belleme that  were he to visit the ruins  of his castle  he would marvel no doubt that the men of the nine centuries  which have passed  should have consistently respected this sturdy little  building  there are traces of aisles having existed  but otherwise the  exterior of the church can have seen no change at all in this long period   inside  however  the crude whitewash  the curious assemblage of enormous  seventeenth century gravestones that are leant against the walls  and the  terribly jarring almost life sized crucifix  all give one that feeling of  revulsion that is inseparable from an ill kept place of worship  on the  banks of the river outside  women may be seen washing clothes  the sounds  of the railway come from the station near by  and overhead  rising above  the foliage at its feet  are the broken walls and shattered keep from which  we have been gazing      illustration  one of the towers in the walls of domfront     the walls of the town  punctuated by many a quaint tower  have lost their  fearsome aspect owing to the domestic uses to which the towers are palpably  devoted  one of them appears in the adjoining illustration  and it is  typical of the half dozen or so that still rise above the pretty gardens  that are perched along the steep ascent  but though domfront is full of  almost thrilling suggestions of medievalism and the glamour of an ancient  town  yet there is a curious lack of picturesque arrangement  so that if  one were to be led away by the totally uninteresting photographs that may  be seen in the shops  one would miss one of the most unique spots in  normandy     stretching away towards flers  there is a tract of green country all ups  and downs  but with no distant views except the peep of domfront that  appears a few miles north of the town  crowning the ridge of the hill is  the keep of the castle  resembling a closed fist with the second finger  raised  and near it  the bell cote of the palais de justice and the spire  of the church break the line of the old houses  ferns grow by the roadside  on every bank  but the cottages and farms are below the average of rustic  beauty that one soon demands in this part of france     flers is a somewhat busy manufacturing town where cotton and thread  mills have robbed the place of its charm  at first sight one might  imagine the church which bears the date      was of considerably  greater age  but inside one is almost astounded at the ramshackle  galleries  the white washed roof of rough boards discoloured by damp   and the general squalor of the place relieved only by a ponderous  altar piece of classic design  the castle is still in good preservation  but although it dates from early norman times  it is chiefly of the  sixteenth century     out in the country again  going westwards  the cottage industry of  weaving is apparent in nearly every cottage one sees  the loud  click a ti clack  click a ti clack of the looms can be heard on every  side as one passes such villages as landisacq  everywhere the scenery  is exceedingly english  the steep hillsides are often covered with  orchards  and the delicate green of the apple trees in spring time   half smothered in pinky white blossom  gives the country a garden like  aspect  you may see a man harrowing a field on a sudden slope with a  cloud of dust blowing up from the dry light soil  and you may hear him  make that curious hullaballooing by which the peasants direct their  horses  so different from the grunting  way yup there  of the english  ploughman  coming down a long descent  a great stretch of country to  the north that includes the battlefield of tinchebrai comes into view   it is hard to associate the rich green pastures  smiling orchards  and  peaceful cattle  with anything so gruesome as a battle between armies  led by brothers  but it was near the little town of tinchebrai that the  two brothers  henry i   king of england  and robert duke of normandy  fought for the possession of normandy  henry s army was greatly  superior to that of his brother  for he had the valuable help of the  counts of conches  breteuil  thorigny  mortagne  montfort  and two or  three others as powerful  but despite all this array  the battle for  some time was very considerably in robert s favour  and it was only  when henry  heavily pressed by his brother s brilliant charge  ordered  his reserves to envelop the rear  that the great battle went in favour  of the english king  among the prisoners were robert and his youthful  son william  the counts of mortain  estouteville  ferrieres  and a  large number of notable men  until his death  twenty seven years later   henry kept his brother captive in cardiff castle  and it has been said  that  owing to an effort to escape  henry was sufficiently lacking in  all humane feelings towards his unfortunate brother  to have both his  eyes put out  it seems a strange thing that exactly sixty years after  the battle of hastings  a norman king of england  should conquer the  country which had belonged to his father     the old church of st remy at tinchebrai  part of which dates from the  twelfth century  has been abandoned for a new building  but the inn  the  hotel lion d or  which bears the date       is still in use  vire  however   is only ten miles off  and its rich mediaeval architecture urges us  forward     standing in the midst of the cobbled street  there suddenly appears right  ahead a splendid thirteenth century gateway  the tour de l horloge  that  makes one of the richest pictures in normandy  it is not always one can see  the curious old tower thrown up by a blaze of gold in the west  but those  who are fortunate enough to see such an effect may get a small suggestion  of the scene from the illustration given here  the little painted figure of  the virgin and child stands in a niche just over the arch  and by it  appears the prayer  marie protege la ville      one of the charms of vire is its cleanliness  for i can recall no  unpleasant smells having interfered with the pleasure of exploring the old  streets  there is a great market on the northern side of the town  open and  breezy  it slopes clear away without any intervening buildings to a great  expanse of green wooded country  suggestive of some of the views that lie  all around one at avranches  the dark old church of notre dame dates mainly  from the twelfth century  houses and small shops are built up against it  between the buttresses in a familiar  almost confidential manner  and on  the south side  the row of gargoyles have an almost humorous appearance   the drips upon the pavement and shops below were evidently a nuisance  and  rain water spouts  with plain pipes leading diagonally from them  have been  attached to each grotesque head  making it seem that the grinning monsters  have developed a great and unquenchable thirst  inside  the church is dark  and impressive  there are double rows of pillars in the aisles  and a huge  crucifix hangs beneath the tower  thrown up darkly against the chancel   which is much painted and gilded  the remains of the great castle consist  of nothing more than part of the tall keep  built eight hundred years ago   and fortunately not entirely destroyed when the rest of the castle came  down by the order of cardinal richelieu  an exploration of the quaint  streets of vire will reveal two or three ancient gateways  many gabled  houses  some of which are timber framed visually  and most of them are the  same beneath their skins of plaster  the houses in one of the streets are  connected with the road by a series of wooden bridges across the river   which there forms one of the many pictures to be found in vire     mortain is separated from vire by fifteen miles of exceedingly hilly  country  and those who imagine that all the roads in normandy are the flat  and poplar bordered ones that are so often encountered  should travel along  this wonderful switch back  as far as sourdeval there seems scarcely a yard  of level ground  it is either a sudden ascent or a breakneck rush into a  trough like depression  you pass copices of firs and beautiful woods   although in saying beautiful it is in a limited sense  for one seldom finds  the really rich woodlands that are so priceless an ornament to many surrey  and kentish lanes  the road is shaded by tall trees when it begins to  descend into the steep rocky gorge of the cance with its tumbling  waterfalls that are a charming feature of this approach to mortain  high  upon the rocks on the left appears an enormous gilded statue of the virgin   in the grounds of the abbaye blanche  going downwards among the broken  sunlight and shadows on the road  mortain appears  picturesquely perched on  a great rocky steep  and in the opening of the valley a blue haze suggests  the great expanse of level country towards the south  the big parish church  of the town was built originally in      by that robert of mortain  who  it  will be remembered  was one of the first of the normans to receive from the  victorious william a grant of land in england  the great tower which stands  almost detached on the south west side is remarkable for its enormously  tall slit windows  for they run nearly from the ground to the saddle back  roof  the interior of this church is somewhat unusual  the nave and chancel  being structurally one  and the aisles are separated by twenty four  circular grey pillars with corinthian capitals  the plain surfaces of the  walls and vaulting are absolutely clean white  picked out with fine black  lines to represent stone work  a scarcely successful treatment of such an  interior  on either side of the high altar stand two great statues  representing st guillaume and st evroult     to those who wish to  do  all the sights of mortain there is the chapel of  st michael  which stands high up on the margin of a great rocky hill  but  the building having been reconstructed about fifty years ago  the chief  attraction to the place is the view  which in tolerably clear weather   includes mont st michel towards which we are making our way     a perfectly straight and fairly level stretch of road brings you to st  hilaire du harcout  on the road one passes two or three large country  houses with their solemn and perfectly straight avenues leading directly up  to them at right angles from the road  the white jalousies seem always  closed  the grass on the lawns seems never cut  and the whole  establishments have a pathetically deserted appearance to the passer by  a  feature of this part of the country can scarcely be believed without  actually using one s eyes  it is the wooden chimney stack  covered with oak  shingles  that surmounts the roofs of most of the cottages  where the  shingles have fallen off  the cement rubble that fills the space between  the oak framing appears  but it is scarcely credible that  even with this  partial protection  these chimneys should have survived so many centuries   i have asked the inmates of some of the cottages whether they ever feared a  fire in their chimneys  but they seemed to consider the question as totally  unnecessary  for some providence seems to have watched over their frail  structures     st hilaire has a brand new church and nothing picturesque in its long   almost monotonous  street  instead of turning aside at pontaubault towards  mont st michel  we will go due north from that hamlet to the beautifully  situated avranches  this prosperous looking town used  at one time  to have  a large english colony  but it has recently dwindled to such small  dimensions that the english chaplain has an exceedingly small parish  the  streets seem to possess a wonderful cleanliness  all the old houses appear  to have made way for modern buildings which  in a way  give avranches the  aspect of a watering place  but its proximity to the sea is more apparent  in a map than when one is actually in the town  on one side of the great  place in front of the church of notre dame des champs is the jardin des  plantes  to pass from the blazing sunshine and loose gravel  to the dense  green shade of the trees in this delightful retreat is a pleasure that can  be best appreciated on a hot afternoon in summer  the shade  however  and  the beds of flowers are not the only attractions of these gardens  their  greatest charm is the wonderful view over the shining sands and the  glistening waters of the rivers see and selune that  at low tide  take  their serpentine courses over the delicately tinted waste of sand that  occupies st michael s bay  out beyond the little wooded promontory that  protects the mouth of the see  lies mont st michel  a fretted silhouette of  flat pearly grey  and a little to the north is tombelaine  a less  pretentious islet in this fairyland sea  framed by the stems and foliage of  the trees  this view is one of the most fascinating in normandy  one would  be content to stay here all through the sultry hours of a summer day  to  listen to the distant hum of conversation among white capped nursemaids  as  they sew busily  giving momentary attention to their charges  but avranches  has an historical spot that no student of history  and indeed no one who  cares anything for the picturesque events that crowd the pages of the  chronicles of england in the days of the norman kings  may miss  it is the  famous stone upon which henry ii  knelt when he received absolution for the  murder of becket at the hands of the papal legate  to reach this stone is   for a stranger  a matter of some difficulty  from the place by the jardin  des plantes  it is necessary to plunge down a steep descent towards the  railway station  and then one climbs a series of zigzag paths on a high  grassy bank that brings one out upon the place huet  in one corner   surrounded by chains and supported by low iron posts  is the historic  stone  it is generally thickly coated with dust  but the brass plate  affixed to a pillar of the doorway is quite legible  these  and a few  fragments of carved stone that lie half smothered in long grass and weeds  at a short distance from the railed in stone  are all that remain of the  cathedral that existed in the time of henry ii     it must have been an impressive scene on that sunday in may       when the  papal legate  in his wonderful robes  stood by the north transept door  of  which only this fragment remains  and granted absolution to the sovereign   who  kneeling in all humbleness and submission  was relieved of the curse  of excommunication which had been laid on him after the tragic affair in  the sanctuary at canterbury  in place of the splendid cathedral  whose nave  collapsed  causing the demolition of the whole building in       there is a  new church with the two great western towers only carried up to half the  height intended for them     from the roadway that runs along the side of the old castle walls in  terrace fashion there is another wonderful view of rich green country   through which  at one s feet  winds the river see  away towards the  north west the road to granville can be seen passing over the hills in a  perfectly straight line  but this part of the country may be left for  another chapter             gray towers     overlook a space of flowers     and the silent isle imbowers    the lady of shalott       by the margin  willow veil d    slide the heavy barges trail d    by slow horses  and unhail d    the shallop flitteth

opened with the following stanza  which  the  quarterly  ridiculed  and which was afterwards excised  its  omission is surely not to be regretted  whatever fitzgerald may have  thought       i met in all the close green ways     while walking with my line and rod     the wealthy miller s mealy face     like the moon in an ivy tod     he looked so jolly and so good      while fishing in the milldam water     i laughed to see him as he stood     and dreamt not of the miller s daughter                                                       i see the wealthy miller yet     his double chin  his portly size     and who that knew him could forget    the busy wrinkles round his eyes     the slow wise smile that  round about    his dusty forehead drily curl d     seem d half within and half without     and full of dealings with the world       in yonder chair i see him sit     three fingers round the old silver cup      i see his gray eyes twinkle yet    at his own jest  gray eyes lit up    with summer lightnings of a soul    so full of summer warmth  so glad     so healthy  sound  and clear and whole     his memory scarce can make me     sad       yet fill my glass  give me one kiss     my own sweet     alice  we must die     there s somewhat in this world amiss    shall be unriddled by and by     there s somewhat flows to us in life     but more is taken quite away     pray  alice  pray  my darling wife         that we may die the self same day       have i not found a happy earth     i least should breathe a thought of pain     would god renew me from my birth    i d almost live my life again     so sweet it seems with thee to walk     and once again to woo thee mine      it seems in after dinner talk    across the walnuts and the wine           to be the long and listless boy    late left an orphan of the squire     where this old mansion mounted high    looks down upon the village spire         for even here      where i and you    have lived and loved alone so long     each morn my sleep was broken thro     by some wild skylark s matin song       and oft i heard the tender dove    in firry woodlands making moan         but ere i saw your eyes  my love     i had no motion of my own     for scarce my life with fancy play d    before i dream d that pleasant dream      still hither thither idly sway d    like those long mosses     in the stream       or from the bridge i lean d to hear    the milldam rushing down with noise     and see the minnows everywhere    in crystal eddies glance and poise     the tall flag flowers when     they sprung    below the range of stepping stones     or those three chestnuts near  that hung    in masses thick with milky cones            but  alice  what an hour was that     when after roving in the woods      twas april then   i came and sat    below the chestnuts  when their buds    were glistening to the breezy blue     and on the slope  an absent fool     i cast me down  nor thought of you     but angled in the higher pool            a love song i had somewhere read     an echo from a measured strain     beat time to nothing in my head    from some odd corner of the brain     it haunted me  the morning long     with weary sameness in the rhymes     the phantom of a silent song     that went and came a thousand times       then leapt a trout  in lazy mood    i watch d the little circles die     they past into the level flood     and there a vision caught my eye     the reflex of a beauteous form     a glowing arm  a gleaming neck     as when a sunbeam wavers warm    within the dark and dimpled beck            for you remember  you had set     that morning  on the casement s edge         a long green box of mignonette     and you were leaning from the ledge     and when i raised my eyes  above    they met with two so full and bright      such eyes  i swear to you  my love     that these have never lost their light            i loved  and love dispell d the fear    that i should die an early death     for love possess d the atmosphere     and filled the breast with purer breath     my mother thought  what ails the boy     for i was alter d  and began    to move about the house with joy     and with the certain step of man       i loved the brimming wave that swam    thro  quiet meadows round the mill     the sleepy pool above the dam     the pool beneath it never still     the meal sacks on the whiten d floor     the dark round of the dripping wheel     the very air about the door    made misty with the floating meal       and oft in ramblings on the wold     when april nights begin to blow     and april s crescent glimmer d cold     i saw the village lights below     i knew your taper far away     and full at heart of trembling hope     from off the wold i came  and lay    upon the freshly flower d slope            the deep brook groan d beneath the mill     and  by that lamp   i thought  she sits      the white chalk quarry      from the hill    gleam d to the flying moon by fits      o that i were beside her now     o will she answer if i call     o would she give me vow for vow     sweet alice  if i told her all             sometimes i saw you sit and spin     and  in the pauses of the wind     sometimes i heard you sing within     sometimes your shadow cross d the blind     at last you rose and moved the light     and the long shadow of the chair    flitted across into the night     and all the casement darken d there       but when at last i dared to speak     the lanes  you know  were white with may     your ripe lips moved not  but your cheek    flush d like the coming of the day          and so it was  half sly  half shy          you would  and would not  little one     although i pleaded tenderly     and you and i were all alone       and slowly was my mother brought    to yield consent to my desire     she wish d me happy  but she thought    i might have look d a little higher     and i was young  too young to wed      yet must i love her for your sake     go fetch your alice here   she said     her eyelid quiver d as she spake       and down i went to fetch my bride     but  alice  you were ill at ease     this dress and that by turns you tried     too fearful that you should not please     i loved you better for your fears     i knew you could not look but well     and dews  that would have fall n in tears     i kiss d away before they fell            i watch d the little flutterings     the doubt my mother would not see     she spoke at large of many things     and at the last she spoke of me     and turning look d upon your face     as near this door you sat apart     and rose  and  with a silent grace    approaching  press d you heart to heart            ah  well  but sing the foolish song    i gave you  alice  on the day         when  arm in arm  we went along     a pensive pair  and you were gay     with bridal flowers  that i may seem     as in the nights of old  to lie    beside the mill wheel in the stream     while those full chestnuts whisper by            it is the miller s daughter     and she is grown so dear  so dear     that i would be the jewel    that trembles at      her ear     for hid in ringlets day and night     i d touch her neck so warm and white       and i would be the girdle    about her dainty  dainty waist     and her heart would beat against me     in sorrow and in rest     and i should know if it beat right     i d clasp it round so close and tight            and i would be the necklace     and all day long to fall and rise         upon her balmy bosom     with her laughter or her sighs     and i would lie so light  so light          i scarce should be      unclasp d at night       a trifle  sweet  which true love spells    true love interprets  right alone     his light upon the letter dwells     for all the spirit is his own          so  if i waste words now  in truth    you must blame love  his early rage    had force to make me rhyme in youth    and makes me talk too much in age            and now those vivid hours are gone     like mine own life to me thou art     where past and present  wound in one     do make a garland for the heart     so sing      that other song i made     half anger d with my happy lot     the day  when in the chestnut shade    i found the blue forget me not            love that hath us in the net          can he pass  and we forget     many suns arise and set     many a chance the years beget     love the gift is love the debt     even so     love is hurt with jar and fret     love is made a vague regret     eyes with idle tears are wet     idle habit links us yet     what is love  for we forget     ah  no  no             look thro  mine eyes with thine  true wife     round my true heart thine arms entwine     my other dearer life in life     look thro  my very soul with thine     untouch d with any shade of years     may those kind eyes for ever dwell     they have not shed a many tears     dear eyes  since first i knew them well       yet tears they shed  they had their part    of sorrow  for when time was ripe     the still affection of the heart    became an outward breathing type     that into stillness past again     and left a want unknown before     although the loss that brought us pain     that loss but made us love the more       with farther lookings on  the kiss     the woven arms  seem but to be    weak symbols of the settled bliss     the comfort  i have found in thee     but that god bless thee  dear  who wrought    two spirits to one equal mind      with

tennyson seems to have taken delight in baffling those who wished  to localise his scenes  he went out of his way to say that the  topographical studies of messrs  church and napier were the only ones

first published in       on being republished in      this poem was  practically rewritten  the alterations and additions so transforming the  poem as to make it almost a new work  i have therefore printed a  complete transcript of the edition of       which the reader can  compare  the final text is  with the exception of one alteration which  will be noticed  precisely that of       so there is no trouble with  variants    none  is the first of tennyson s fine classical studies  the  poem is modelled partly on the alexandrian idyll  such an idyll for  instance as the second idyll of theocritus or the  megara  or  europa   of moschus  and partly perhaps on the narratives in the  metamorphoses   of ovid  to which the opening bears a typical resemblance  it is  possible that the poem may have been suggested by beattie s  judgment of  paris  which tells the same story  and tells it on the same lines on  which it is told here  though it is not placed in the mouth of  none   beattie s poem opens with an elaborate description of ida and of troy in  the distance  paris  the husband of  none  is one afternoon confronted  with the three goddesses who are  as in tennyson s idyll  elaborately  delineated as symbolising what they here symbolise  each makes her  speech and each offers what she has to offer  worldly dominion  wisdom   sensual pleasure  there is  of course  no comparison in point of merit  between the two poems  beattie s being in truth perfectly commonplace   in its symbolic aspect the poem may be compared with the temptations to  which christ is submitted in  paradise regained   see books iii  and iv         there lies a vale in ida  lovelier        than all the valleys of ionian hills     the swimming vapour slopes athwart the glen     puts

was founded on the old  scotch ballad  the twa sisters   see for that ballad sharpe s  ballad  book   no  x   p       but there is no resemblance at all between the  ballad and this poem beyond the fact that in each there are two sisters  who are both loved by a certain squire  the elder in jealousy pushing  the younger into a river and drowning her         we were two daughters of one race

ascertain to whom this dedication was addressed   sir franklin lushington tells me that he thinks it was an imaginary  person  the dedication explains the allegory intended  the poem appears  to have been suggested  as we learn from  tennyson s life   vol  i   p         by a remark of trench to tennyson when they were undergraduates at  trinity   we cannot live in art   it was the embodiment tennyson added  of his belief  that the god like life is with man and for man    cf    his own lines in  love and duty           for a man is not as god     but then most god like being most a man     it is a companion poem to the  vision of sin   in that poem is traced  the effect of indulgence in the grosser pleasures of sense  in this the  effect of the indulgence in the more refined pleasures of sense         i send you here a sort of allegory      for you will understand it  of a soul         a sinful soul possess d of many gifts     a spacious garden full of flowering weeds     a glorious devil  large in heart and brain     that did love beauty only   beauty seen    in all varieties of mould and mind     and knowledge for its beauty  or if good     good only for its beauty  seeing not    that beauty  good  and knowledge  are three sisters    that doat upon each other  friends to man     living together under the same roof     and never can be sunder d without tears     and he that shuts love out  in turn shall be    shut out from love  and on her threshold lie    howling in outer darkness  not for this    was common clay ta en from the common earth     moulded by god  and temper d with the tears    of angels to the perfect shape of man        footnote             i send you  friend  a sort of allegory    you are an artist and will understand  its many lesser meanings  of a soul                the palace of art    first published in       but altered so extensively on its republication  in      as to be practically rewritten  the alterations in it after       were not numerous  consisting chiefly in the deletion of two stanzas  after line     and the insertion of the three stanzas which follow in  the present text  together with other minor verbal corrections  all of  which have been noted  no alterations were made in the text after        the allegory tennyson explains in the dedicatory verses  but the  framework of the poem was evidently suggested by  ecclesiastes  ii         the position of the hero is precisely that of solomon  both began  by assuming that man is self sufficing and the world sufficient  the  verdict of the one in consequence being  vanity of vanities  all is  vanity   of the other what the poet here records  an admirable  commentary on the poem is afforded by matthew arnold s picture of the  romans before christ taught the secret of the only real happiness  possible to man  see  obermann once more   the teaching of the poem  has been admirably explained by spedding  it  represents allegorically  the condition of a mind which  in the love of beauty and the triumphant  consciousness of knowledge and intellectual supremacy  in the intense  enjoyment of its own power and glory  has lost sight of its relation to  man and god   see  tennyson s life   vol  i   p                i built my soul a lordly pleasure house    wherein at ease for aye to dwell     i said   o soul  make merry and carouse

and so i felt resign d     and up the valley came a swell of music on the wind       i thought that it was fancy  and i listen d in my bed     and then did something speak to me  i know not what was said     for great delight and shuddering took hold of all my mind     and up the valley came again the music on the wind       but you were sleeping  and i said   it s not for them  it s mine      and if it comes     three times  i thought  i take it for a sign     and once again it came  and close beside the window bars     then seem d to go right up to heaven and die among the stars       so now i think my time is near  i trust it is  i know    the blessed music went that way my soul will have to go     and for myself  indeed  i care not if i go to day     but  effie  you must comfort

upon the earth    by bread    then straightway they went and mixed with the men of the    lotos eaters  and so it was that the lotos eaters devised not death    for our fellows but gave them of the lotos to taste  now whosoever of    them did eat the honey sweet fruit of the lotos had no more wish to    bring tidings nor to come back  but there he chose to abide with the    lotos eating men ever

republication in       it had been written by june        and appears to  have been originally entitled  legend of fair women   see spedding s  letter dated   st june         life   i         in nearly every edition  between      and      it was revised  and perhaps no poem proves more  strikingly the scrupulous care which tennyson took to improve what he  thought susceptible of improvement  the work which inspired it   chaucer s  legend of good women   was written about       thus   preluding  by nearly two hundred years the  spacious times of great  elizabeth   there is no resemblance between the poems beyond the fact  that both are visions and both have as their heroines illustrious women  who have been unfortunate  cleopatra is the only one common to the two  poems  tennyson s is an exquisite work of art  the transition from the  anarchy of dreams to the dreamland landscape and to the sharply denned  figures  the skill with which the heroines  what could be more perfect  that cleopatra and jephtha s daughter   are chosen and contrasted  the  wonderful way in which the iphigenia of euripides and lucretius and the  cleopatra of shakespeare are realised are alike admirable  the poem  opened in      with the following strangely irrelevant verses  excised  in       which as fitzgerald observed  make a perfect poem by themselves  without affecting the  dream              as when a man  that sails in a balloon       downlooking sees the solid shining ground      stream from beneath him in the broad blue noon       tilth  hamlet  mead and mound         and takes his flags and waves them to the mob       that shout below  all faces turned to where      glows ruby like the far up crimson globe       filled with a finer air         so lifted high  the poet at his will      lets the great world flit from him  seeing all       higher thro  secret splendours mounting still       self poised  nor fears to fall           hearing apart the echoes of his fame     while i spoke thus  the seedsman  memory     sowed my deepfurrowed thought with many a name     whose glory will not die       i read  before my eyelids dropt their shade      the legend of good women   long ago    sung by the morning star     of song  who made    his music heard below       dan chaucer  the first warbler  whose sweet breath    preluded those melodious bursts  that fill    the spacious times of great elizabeth    with sounds that echo still       and  for a while  the knowledge of his art    held me above the subject  as strong gales    hold swollen clouds from raining  tho  my heart     brimful of those wild tales       charged both mine eyes with tears     in every land i saw  wherever light illumineth     beauty and anguish walking hand in hand    the downward slope to death           those far renowned brides of ancient song    peopled the hollow dark  like burning stars     and i heard sounds of insult  shame  and wrong     and trumpets blown for wars       and clattering flints batter d with clanging hoofs     and i saw crowds in column d sanctuaries     and forms that pass d     at windows and on roofs    of marble palaces       corpses across the threshold  heroes tall    dislodging pinnacle and parapet    upon the tortoise creeping to the wall         lances in ambush set       and high shrine doors burst thro  with heated blasts    that run before the fluttering tongues of fire     white surf wind scatter d over sails and masts     and ever climbing higher       squadrons and squares of men in brazen plates     scaffolds  still sheets of water  divers woes     ranges of glimmering vaults with iron grates     and hush d seraglios       so shape chased shape as swift as  when to land    bluster the winds and tides the self same way     crisp foam flakes scud along the level sand     torn from the fringe of spray       i started once  or seem d to start in pain     resolved on noble things  and strove to speak     as when a great thought strikes along the brain     and flushes all the cheek       and once my arm was lifted to hew down     a cavalier from off his saddle bow     that bore a lady from a leaguer d town     and then  i know not how       all those sharp fancies  by down lapsing thought    stream d onward  lost their edges  and did creep    roll d on each other  rounded  smooth d and brought    into the gulfs

journey done     and with dead lips smiled at the twilight plain     half fall n across the threshold of the sun     never to rise again       there was no motion in the dumb dead air     not any song

and at the root thro  lush green grasses burn d    the red anemone       i knew the flowers  i knew the leaves  i knew    the tearful glimmer of the languid dawn    on those long  rank  dark wood walks  drench d in dew     leading from lawn to lawn       the smell of violets  hidden in the green     pour d back into my empty soul and frame    the times when i remember to have been    joyful

at length i saw a lady     within call     stiller than chisell d marble  standing there     a daughter of the gods  divinely tall         and most divinely fair       her loveliness with shame and with surprise    froze my swift speech  she turning on my face    the star like sorrows of immortal eyes     spoke slowly in her place        i had great beauty  ask thou not my name     no one can be more wise than destiny     many drew swords and died     where er i came i brought calamity         no marvel  sovereign lady      in fair field    myself for such a face had boldly died           i

was blasted with a curse     this woman was the cause        i was cut off from hope in that sad place          which yet to name my spirit loathes and fears          my father held his hand upon his face     i  blinded with my tears        still strove to speak  my voice was thick with sighs    as in a dream  dimly i could descry    the stern black bearded kings with wolfish eyes     waiting to see me die        the high masts flicker d as they lay afloat     the crowds  the temples  waver d  and the shore     the bright death quiver d at the victim s throat     touch d  and i knew no more

full words sank thro  the silence drear     as thunder drops fall on a sleeping sea     sudden i heard a voice that cried   come here     that i may look on thee        i turning saw  throned on a flowery rise     one sitting on a crimson scarf unroll d     a queen  with swarthy cheeks      and bold black eyes     brow bound with burning gold       she  flashing forth a haughty smile  began

piercing orbs  and fill d with light    the interval of sound       still with their fires love tipt his keenest darts     as once they drew into two burning rings    all beams of love  melting the mighty hearts    of captains and of kings       slowly my sense undazzled  then i heard    a noise of some one coming thro  the lawn     and singing clearer than the crested bird     that claps his wings at dawn        the torrent brooks of hallow d israel    from craggy hollows pouring  late and soon     sound all night long  in falling thro  the dell     far heard beneath the moon        the balmy moon of blessed israel    floods all the deep blue gloom with beams divine     all night the splinter d crags that wall the dell    with spires of silver shine        as one that museth where

the time this trio of poems was written  england was passing through the throes which preceded  accompanied and  followed the reform bill  and the lessons which tennyson preaches in  them were particularly appropriate  he belonged to the liberal party  rather in relation to social and religious than to political questions   thus he ardently supported the anti slavery convention and advocated the  measure for abolishing subscription to the thirty nine articles  but he  was  as a politician  on the side of canning  peel and the duke of  wellington  regarding as they did the new

written at the time of the reform bill agitation   is a political allegory showing how illusory were the supposed  advantages held out by the radicals to the poor and labouring classes   the old woman typifies these classes  the stranger the radicals  the  goose the radical programme  free trade and the like  the eggs such  advantages as the proposed radical measures might for a time seem to  confer  the cluttering goose  the storm and whirlwind the heavy price  which would have to be paid for them in the social anarchy resulting  from triumphant radicalism  the allegory may be narrowed to the free  trade question         i knew an old wife lean and poor     her rags scarce held together     there strode a stranger to the door     and it was windy weather       he held a goose upon his arm     he utter d rhyme and reason      here  take the goose  and keep you warm     it is a stormy season        she caught the white goose by the leg     a goose   twas no great matter     the goose let fall a golden egg    with cackle and with clatter       she dropt the goose  and caught the pelf     and ran to tell her neighbours     and bless d herself  and cursed herself     and rested from her labours       and feeding high  and living soft     grew plump and able bodied     until the grave churchwarden doff d     the parson smirk d and nodded       so sitting  served by man and maid     she felt her heart grow prouder     but  ah  the more the white goose laid    it clack d and cackled louder       it clutter d here  it chuckled there     it stirr d the old wife s mettle     she shifted in her elbow chair     and hurl d the pan and kettle        a quinsy choke thy cursed note      then wax d her anger stronger      go  take the goose  and wring her throat     i will not bear

the floor    they flounder d all together     there strode a stranger to the door     and it was windy weather       he took the goose upon his arm     he utter d words of scorning      so keep you cold  or keep you warm     it is a stormy morning        the wild wind rang from park and plain     and round the attics rumbled     till all the tables danced again     and half the chimneys tumbled       the glass blew in  the fire blew out     the blast was hard and harder     her cap blew off  her gown blew up     and a whirlwind clear d the larder       and while on all sides breaking loose

only alteration made since          this prologue was written  like the epilogue  after  the epic  had been  composed  being added  fitzgerald says  to anticipate or excuse  the  faint homeric echoes   to give a reason for telling an old world tale   the poet  mouthing out his hollow oes and aes  is  we are told  a good  description of tennyson s tone and manner of reading         at francis allen s on the christmas eve       the game of forfeits done  the girls all kiss d    beneath the sacred bush and past away      the parson holmes  the poet everard hall     the host  and i sat round the wassail bowl     then half way ebb d  and there we held a talk     how all the old honour had from christmas gone     or gone  or dwindled down to some odd games    in some odd nooks like this  till i  tired out    with cutting eights that day upon the pond     where  three times slipping from the outer edge     i bump d the ice into three several stars     fell in a doze  and half awake i heard    the parson taking wide and wider sweeps     now harping on the church commissioners         now hawking at geology and schism     until i woke  and found him settled down    upon the general decay of faith    right thro  the world   at home was little left     and none abroad  there was no anchor  none     to hold by   francis  laughing  clapt his hand    on everard s shoulder  with  i hold by him       and i   quoth everard   by the wassail bowl       why  yes   i said   we knew your gift that way    at college  but another which you had     i mean of verse  for so we held it then      what came of that     you know   said frank   he burnt    his epic  his king arthur  some twelve books           and then to me demanding why   oh  sir     he thought that nothing new was said  or else    something so said  twas nothing  that a truth    looks freshest in the fashion of the day     god knows  he has a mint of reasons  ask     it pleased  me  well enough    nay  nay   said hall      why take the style of those heroic times     for nature brings not back the mastodon     nor we those times  and why should any man    remodel models  these twelve books of mine        were faint homeric echoes  nothing worth     mere chaff and draff  much better burnt       but i   said francis   pick d the eleventh from this hearth     and have it  keep a thing its use will come     i hoard it as a sugar plum for holmes      he laugh d  and i  though sleepy  like a horse    that hears the corn bin open  prick d my ears     for i remember d everard s college fame    when we were freshmen  then at my request    he brought it  and the poet little urged     but with some prelude of disparagement     read  mouthing out his hollow oes and aes     deep chested music  and to this result        footnote    a burning topic with the clergy in and about            footnote          to        you know   said frank   he flung his epic  of king arthur in the fire   the present reading             footnote                     remodel models rather than the life     and these twelve books of mine  to speak the truth      present reading                  morte d arthur    this is tennyson s first study from malory s  morte d arthur   we learn  from fitzgerald that it was written as early as the spring of       for  in that year tennyson read it to fitzgerald and spedding   out of a ms   in a little red book   and again we learn that he repeated some lines of  it at the end of may        one calm day on windermere  adding  not bad  that  fitz   is it     life   i         it is here represented as the  eleventh book of an epic  the rest of which had been destroyed  though  tennyson afterwards incorporated it  adding introductory lines  with  what was virtually to prove an epic in twelve books   the idylls of the  king   the substance of the poem is drawn from the third  fourth and  fifth chapters of the twenty first book of malory s  romance   which is  followed very closely  it is called  an homeric echo   but the diction  bears a much closer resemblance to that of virgil than to that of homer   though the rhythm is perhaps more homeric than virgilian  it is  tennyson s masterpiece in  the grand style   and is indeed as near  perfection as any work of this kind could be  in spite of its singular  mixture of simplicity  purely homeric  and artificiality  at times  ultra virgilian  the incongruity never shocks  so noble and impressive  is the general effect  the text of      was never subsequently altered  except in the spelling of  mere  and  though  in lines                              and in the insertion in      of the line            across the ridge and pac d beside the mere            so all day long the noise of battle roll d    among the mountains by the winter sea     until king arthur s table  man by man     had fall n in lyonness about their lord     king arthur  then  because his wound was deep     the bold sir bedivere uplifted him     sir bedivere  the last of all his knights     and bore him to a chapel nigh the field         a broken chancel with a broken cross     that stood on a dark strait of barren land     on one side lay the ocean  and on one    lay a great water  and the moon was full     then spake king arthur to sir bedivere      the sequel of to day unsolders all    the goodliest fellowship of famous knights    whereof this world holds record  such a sleep    they sleep  the men i loved  i think that we    shall never more  at any future time     delight our souls with talk of knightly deeds     walking about the gardens and the halls    of camelot  as in the days that were     i perish by this people which i made       tho  merlin sware that i should come again    to rule once more  but let what will be  be     i am so deeply smitten thro  the helm    that without help i cannot last till morn     thou therefore take my brand     excalibur     which was my pride  for thou rememberest how    in those old days  one summer noon  an arm    rose up from out the bosom of the lake     clothed in white samite  mystic  wonderful     holding the sword  and how i row d across    and took it  and have worn it  like a king     and  wheresoever i am sung or told    in aftertime  this also shall be known     but now delay not  take excalibur     and fling him far into the middle mere     watch what thou seest  and lightly bring me word      to him replied the bold sir bedivere      it is not meet  sir king  to leave thee thus     aidless  alone  and smitten thro  the helm     a little thing may harm a wounded man     yet i thy hest will all perform at full     watch what i see  and lightly bring thee word      so saying  from the ruin d shrine he stept    and in the moon athwart the place of tombs     where lay the mighty bones of ancient men     old knights  and over them the sea wind sang    shrill  chill  with flakes of foam  he  stepping down    by zig zag paths  and juts of pointed rock     came on the shining levels of the lake     there drew he forth the brand excalibur     and o er him  drawing it  the winter moon     brightening the skirts of a long cloud  ran forth    and sparkled keen with frost against the hilt     for all the haft twinkled with diamond sparks         myriads of topaz lights  and jacinth work    of subtlest jewellery  he gazed so long    that both his eyes were dazzled  as he stood     this way and that dividing the swift mind         in act to throw  but at the last it seem d    better to leave excalibur conceal d    there in the many knotted waterflags     that whistled stiff and dry about the marge     so strode he back slow to the wounded king     then spake king arthur to sir bedivere      hast thou perform d my mission which i gave     what is it thou hast seen  or what hast heard      and answer made the bold sir bedivere      i heard the ripple washing in the reeds         and the wild water lapping on the crag      to whom replied king arthur  faint and pale      thou hast betray d thy nature and thy name     not rendering true answer  as beseem d    thy fealty  nor like a noble knight     for surer sign had follow d  either hand     or voice  or else a motion of the mere     this is a shameful thing for men to lie     yet now  i charge thee  quickly go again        as thou art lief and dear  and do the thing    i bade thee  watch  and lightly bring me word      then went sir bedivere the second time    across the ridge  and paced beside the mere         counting the dewy pebbles  fix d in thought     but when he saw the wonder of the hilt     how curiously and strangely chased  he smote    his palms together  and he cried aloud      and if indeed i cast the brand away     surely a precious thing  one worthy note     should thus be lost for ever from the earth     which might have pleased the eyes of many men     what good should follow this  if this were done     what harm  undone  deep harm to disobey     seeing obedience is the bond of rule     were it well to obey then  if a king demand    an act unprofitable against himself     the king is sick  and knows not what he does     what record  or what relic of my lord    should be to aftertime  but empty breath    and rumours of a doubt  but were this kept     stored in some treasure house of mighty kings     some one might show it at a joust of arms     saying   king arthur s sword  excalibur     wrought by the lonely maiden of the lake     nine years she wrought it  sitting in the deeps    upon the hidden bases of the hills      so might some old man speak in the aftertime    to all the people  winning reverence     but now much honour and much fame were lost      so spake he  clouded with his own conceit     and hid excalibur the second time     and so strode back slow to the wounded king     then spoke king arthur  breathing heavily      what is it thou hast seen  or what hast heard      and answer made the bold sir bedivere      i heard the water lapping on the crag     and the long ripple washing in the reeds      to whom replied king arthur  much in wrath      ah  miserable and unkind  untrue         unknightly  traitor hearted  woe is me     authority forgets a dying king         laid widow d of the power in his eye    that bow d the will  i see thee what thou art     for thou  the latest left of all my knights     in whom should meet the offices of all     thou wouldst betray me for the precious hilt     either from lust of gold  or like a girl    valuing the giddy pleasure of the eyes     yet  for a man may fail in duty twice     and the third time may prosper  get thee hence     but  if thou spare to fling excalibur     i will arise and slay thee with my hands      then quickly rose sir bedivere  and ran          and  leaping down the ridges lightly  plunged    among the bulrush beds  and clutch d the sword     and strongly wheel d and threw it  the great brand    made lightnings in the splendour of the moon     and flashing round and round  and whirl d in an arch     shot like a streamer of the northern morn     seen where the moving isles of winter shock    by night  with noises of the northern sea     so flash d and fell the brand excalibur     but ere he dipt the surface  rose an arm    clothed in white samite  mystic  wonderful     and caught him by the hilt  and brandish d him    three times  and drew him under in the mere     and lightly went the other to the king     then spoke king arthur  drawing thicker breath      now see i by thine eyes that this is done     speak out  what is it thou hast heard  or seen      and answer made the bold sir bedivere      sir king  i closed mine eyelids  lest the gems    should blind my purpose  for i never saw     nor shall see  here or elsewhere  till i die     not tho  i live three lives of mortal men     so great a miracle as yonder hilt     then with both hands i flung him  wheeling him     but when i look d again  behold an arm     clothed in white samite  mystic  wonderful     that caught him by the hilt  and brandish d him    three times  and drew him under in the mere      and answer made king arthur  breathing hard      my end draws nigh  tis time that i were gone     make broad thy shoulders to receive my weight     and bear me to the margin  yet i fear         my wound hath taken cold  and i shall die      so saying  from the pavement he hath rose     slowly  with pain  reclining on his arm     and looking wistfully with wide blue eyes    as in a picture  him sir bedivere    remorsefully regarded thro  his tears     and would have spoken  but he found not words     then took with care  and kneeling on one knee     o er both his shoulders drew the languid hands     and rising bore him thro  the place of tombs     but  as he walk d  king arthur panted hard     like one that feels a nightmare on his bed    when all the house is mute  so sigh d the king     muttering and murmuring at his ear     quick  quick  i fear it is too late  and i shall die       but the other swiftly strode from ridge to ridge     clothed with his breath  and looking  as he walk d     larger than human on the frozen hills     he heard the deep behind him  and a cry    before  his own thought drove him like a goad     dry clash d his harness in the icy caves    and barren chasms  and all to left and right    the bare black cliff clang d round him  as he based    his feet on juts of slippery crag that rang    sharp smitten with the dint of armed heels      and on a sudden  lo  the level lake     and the long glories of the winter moon     then saw they how there hove a dusky barge          dark as a funeral scarf from stem to stern     beneath them  and descending they were ware    that all the decks were dense with stately forms    black stoled  black hooded  like a dream  by these    three queens with crowns of gold  and from them rose    a cry that shiver d to the tingling stars     and  as it were one voice  an agony    of lamentation  like a wind  that shrills    all night in a waste land  where no one comes     or hath come  since the making of the world     then murmur d arthur   place me in the barge      and to the barge they came  there those three queens    put forth their hands  and took the king  and wept     but she  that rose the tallest of them all    and fairest  laid his head upon her lap     and loosed the shatter d casque  and chafed his hands     and call d him by his name  complaining loud     and dropping bitter tears against his brow    striped with dark blood  for all his face was white    and colourless  and like the wither d moon    smote by the fresh beam of the springing east     and all his greaves and cuisses dash d with drops    of onset  and the light and lustrous curls      that made his forehead like a rising sun    high from the daeis throne  were parch d with dust     or  clotted into points and hanging loose     mix d with the knightly growth that fringed his lips     so like a shatter d column lay the king     not like that arthur who  with lance in rest     from spur to plume a star of tournament     shot thro  the lists at camelot  and charged    before the eyes of ladies and of kings     then loudly cried the bold sir bedivere           ah  my lord arthur  whither shall i go     where shall i hide my forehead and my eyes     for now i see the true old times are dead     when every morning brought a noble chance     and every chance brought out a noble knight     such times have been not since the light that led    the holy elders with the gift of myrrh     but now the whole round table is dissolved    which was an image of the mighty world     and i  the last  go forth companionless     and the days darken round me  and the years     among new men  strange faces  other minds      and slowly answer d arthur from the barge      the old order changeth  yielding place to new     and god fulfils himself in many ways          lest one good custom should corrupt the world     comfort thyself  what comfort is in me     i have lived my life  and that which i have done    may he within himself make pure  but thou     if thou shouldst never see my face again     pray for my soul  more things are wrought by prayer    than this world dreams of  wherefore  let thy voice    rise like a fountain for me night and day     for what are men better than sheep or goats    that nourish a blind life within the brain     if  knowing god  they lift not hands of prayer    both for themselves and those who call them friend     for so the whole round earth is every way    bound by gold chains      about the feet of god     but now farewell  i am going a long way    with these thou seest  if indeed i go       for all my mind is clouded with a doubt     to the island valley of avilion     where falls not hail  or rain       or any snow     nor ever wind blows loudly  but it lies    deep meadow d  happy  fair with orchard lawns    and bowery hollows crown d with summer sea          where i will heal me of my grievous wound      so said he  and the barge with oar and sail    moved from the brink  like some full breasted swan    that  fluting a wild carol ere her death     ruffles her pure cold plume  and takes the flood    with swarthy webs  long stood sir bedivere    revolving many memories  till the hull    look d one black dot against the verge of dawn     and on the mere the wailing died away       here ended hall  and our last light  that long    had wink d and threaten d darkness  flared and fell     at which the parson  sent to sleep with sound     and waked with silence  grunted  good   but we    sat rapt  it was the tone with which he read      perhaps some modern touches here and there    redeem d it from the charge of nothingness      or else we loved the man  and prized his work     i know not  but we sitting  as i said     the cock crew loud  as at that time of year    the lusty bird takes every hour for dawn     then francis  muttering  like a man ill used      there now  that s nothing   drew a little back     and drove his heel into the smoulder d log     that sent a blast of sparkles up the flue     and so to bed  where yet in sleep i seem d    to sail with arthur under looming shores     point after point  till on to dawn  when dreams    begin to feel the truth and stir of day     to me  methought  who waited with a crowd     there came a bark that  blowing forward  bore     king arthur  like a modern gentleman    of stateliest port  and all the people cried      arthur is come again  he cannot die      then those that stood upon the hills behind    repeated   come again  and thrice as fair      and  further inland  voices echoed

or  the pictures    first published in            in the  gardener s daughter  we have the first of that delightful series  of poems dealing with scenes and characters from ordinary english life   and named appropriately  english idylls   the originator of this species  of poetry in england was southey  in his  english eclogues   written  before       in the preface to these eclogues  which are in blank verse   southey says   the following eclogues  i believe  bear no resemblance to  any poems in our language  this species of composition has become  popular in germany  and i was induced to attempt it by an account of the  german idylls given me in conversation   southey s eclogues are eight in  number   the old mansion house    the grandmother s tale    hannah     the sailor s mother    the witch    the ruined cottage    the last of  the family  and  the alderman s funeral   southey was followed by  wordsworth in  the brothers  and  michael   southey has nothing of the  charm  grace and classical finish of his disciple  but how nearly  tennyson follows him  as copy and model  may be seen by anyone who  compares tennyson s studies with  the ruined cottage   but tennyson s  real master was theocritus  whose influence pervades these poems not so  much directly in definite imitation as indirectly in colour and tone      the gardener s daughter  was written as early as       as it was read  to fitzgerald in that year   life of tennyson   i         tennyson  originally intended to insert a prologue to be entitled  the  antechamber   which contained an elaborate picture of himself  but he  afterwards suppressed it  it is given in the  life   i          this  poem stands alone among the idylls in being somewhat overloaded with  ornament  the text of      remained unaltered through all the subsequent  editions except in line      after      the form  tho   is substituted  for  though          this morning is the morning of the day     when i and eustace from the city went    to see the gardener s daughter  i and he     brothers in art  a friendship so complete    portion d in halves between us  that we grew    the fable of the city where we dwelt     my

painted her     and said to me  she sitting with us then      when will  you  paint like this   and i replied      my words were half in earnest  half in jest        tis not your work  but love s  love  unperceived     a more ideal artist he than all     came  drew your pencil from you  made those eyes    darker than darkest pansies  and that hair    more black than ashbuds in the front of

not wholly in the busy world  nor quite    beyond it  blooms the garden that i love     news from the humming city comes to it    in sound of funeral or of marriage bells     and  sitting muffled in dark leaves  you hear    the windy clanging of the minster clock     although between it and the garden lies    a league of grass  wash d by a slow broad stream     that  stirr d with languid pulses of the oar     waves all its lazy lilies  and creeps on     barge laden  to three arches of a bridge    crown d with the minster towers                                       the fields between    are dewy fresh  browsed by deep udder d kine     and all about the large lime feathers low     the lime a summer home of murmurous wings         in that still place she  hoarded in herself     grew  seldom seen  not less among us lived    her fame from lip to lip  who had not heard    of rose  the gardener s daughter  where was he     so blunt in memory  so old at heart     at such a distance from his youth in grief     that  having seen  forgot  the common mouth     so gross to express delight  in praise of her    grew oratory  such a lord is love     and beauty such a mistress of the world     and if i said that fancy  led by love     would play with flying forms and images     yet this is also true  that  long before    i look d upon her  when i heard her name    my heart was like a prophet to my heart     and told me i should love  a crowd of hopes     that sought to sow themselves like winged seeds     born out of everything i heard and saw     flutter d about my senses and my soul     and vague desires  like fitful blasts of balm    to one that travels quickly  made the air    of life delicious  and all kinds of thought     that verged upon them sweeter than the dream    dream d by a happy man  when the dark east     unseen  is brightening to his bridal morn     and sure this orbit of the memory folds    for ever in itself the day we went    to see her  all the land in flowery squares     beneath a broad and equal blowing wind     smelt of the coming summer  as one large cloud        drew downward  but all else of heaven was pure    up to the sun  and may from verge to verge     and may with me from head to heel  and now     as tho   twere yesterday  as tho  it were    the hour just flown  that morn with all its sound     for those old mays had thrice the life of these      rings in mine ears  the steer forgot to graze     and  where the hedge row cuts the pathway  stood     leaning his horns into the neighbour field     and lowing to his fellows  from the woods    came voices of the well contented doves     the lark could scarce get out his notes for joy     but shook his song together as he near d    his happy home  the ground  to left and right     the cuckoo told his name to all the hills     the mellow ouzel fluted in the elm     the redcap     whistled      and the nightingale    sang loud  as tho  he were the bird of day     and eustace turn d  and smiling said to me      hear how the bushes echo  by my life     these birds have joyful thoughts  think you they sing    like poets  from the vanity of song     or have they any sense of why they sing     and would they praise the heavens for what they have      and i made answer   were there nothing else    for which to praise the heavens but only love     that only love were cause enough for praise      lightly he laugh d  as one that read my thought     and on we went  but ere an hour had pass d     we reach d a meadow slanting to the north     down which a well worn pathway courted us    to one green wicket in a privet hedge     this  yielding  gave into a grassy walk    thro  crowded lilac ambush trimly pruned     and one warm gust  full fed with perfume  blew    beyond us  as we enter d in the cool     the garden stretches southward  in the midst    a cedar spread his dark green layers of shade     the garden glasses shone  and momently    the twinkling laurel scatter d silver lights      eustace   i said   this wonder keeps the house      he nodded  but a moment afterwards    he cried   look  look   before he ceased i turn d     and  ere a star can wink  beheld her there     for up the porch there grew an eastern rose     that  flowering high  the last night s gale had caught     and blown across the walk  one arm aloft      gown d in pure white  that fitted to the shape      holding the bush  to fix it back  she stood     a single stream of all her soft brown hair    pour d on one side  the shadow of the flowers    stole all the golden gloss  and  wavering    lovingly lower  trembled on her waist      ah  happy shade  and still went wavering down     but  ere it touch d a foot  that might have danced    the greensward into greener circles  dipt     and mix d with shadows of the common ground     but the full day dwelt on her brows  and sunn d    her violet eyes  and all her hebe bloom     and doubled his own warmth against her lips     and on the bounteous wave of such a breast    as never pencil drew  half light  half shade     she stood  a sight to make an old man young     so rapt  we near d the house  but she  a rose    in roses  mingled with her fragrant toil     nor heard us come  nor from her tendance turn d    into the world without  till close at hand     and almost ere i knew mine own intent     this murmur broke the stillness of that air    which brooded round about her   ah  one rose     one rose  but one  by those fair fingers cull d     were worth a hundred kisses press d on lips    less exquisite than thine   she look d  but all    suffused with blushes  neither self possess d    nor startled  but betwixt this mood and that     divided in a graceful quiet  paused     and dropt the branch she held  and turning  wound    her looser hair in braid  and stirr d her lips    for some sweet answer  tho  no answer came     nor yet refused the rose  but granted it     and moved away  and left me  statue like     in act to render thanks  i  that whole day     saw her no more  altho  i linger d there    till every daisy slept  and love s white star    beam d thro  the thicken d cedar in the dusk     so home we went  and all the livelong way    with solemn gibe did eustace banter me      now   said he   will you climb the top of art     you cannot fail but work in hues to dim    the titianic flora  will you match    my juliet  you  not you   the master     love  a more ideal artist he than all        so home i went  but could not sleep for joy     reading her perfect features in the gloom     kissing the rose she gave me o er and o er     and shaping faithful record of the glance    that graced the giving  such a noise of life    swarm d in the golden present  such a voice    call d to me from the years to come  and such    a length of bright horizon rimm d the dark     and all that night i heard the watchmen peal    the sliding season  all that night i heard    the heavy clocks knolling the drowsy hours     the drowsy hours  dispensers of all good     o er the mute city stole with folded wings     distilling odours on me as they went    to greet their fairer sisters of the east       love at first sight  first born  and heir to all     made this night thus  henceforward squall nor storm    could keep me from that eden where she dwelt     light pretexts drew me  sometimes a    dutch love for tulips  then for roses  moss or musk     to grace my city rooms  or fruits and cream    served in the weeping elm  and more and more    a word could bring the colour to my cheek     a thought would fill my eyes with happy dew     love trebled life within me  and with each    the year increased  the daughters of the year     one after one  thro  that still garden pass d     each garlanded with her peculiar flower    danced into light  and died into the shade     and each in passing touch d with some new grace    or seem d to touch her  so that day by day     like one that never can be wholly known         her beauty grew  till autumn brought an hour    for eustace  when i heard his deep  i will      breathed  like the covenant of a god  to hold    from thence thro  all the worlds  but i rose up    full of his bliss  and following her dark eyes    felt earth as air beneath me      till i reach d    the wicket gate  and found her standing there     there sat we down upon a garden mound     two mutually enfolded  love  the third     between us  in the circle of his arms    enwound us both  and over many a range    of waning lime the gray cathedral towers     across a hazy glimmer of the west     reveal d their shining windows  from them clash d    the bells  we listen d  with the time we play d     we spoke of other things  we coursed about    the subject most at heart  more near and near     like doves about a dovecote  wheeling round    the central wish  until we settled there         then  in that time and place  i spoke to her     requiring  tho  i knew it was mine own     yet for the pleasure that i took to hear     requiring at her hand the greatest gift     a woman s heart  the heart of her i loved     and in that time and place she answer d me     and in the compass of three little words     more musical than ever came in one     the silver fragments of a broken voice     made me most happy  faltering      i am thine      shall i cease here  is this enough to say    that my desire  like all strongest hopes     by its own energy fulfilled itself     merged in completion  would you learn at full    how passion rose thro  circumstantial grades    beyond all grades develop d  and indeed    i had not staid so long to tell you all     but while i mused came memory with sad eyes     holding the folded annals of my youth     and while i mused  love with knit brows went by     and with a flying finger swept my lips     and spake   be wise  not easily forgiven    are those  who setting wide the doors  that bar    the secret bridal chambers of the heart     let in the day   here  then  my words have end     yet might i tell of meetings  of farewells      of that which came between  more sweet than each     in whispers  like the whispers of the leaves    that tremble round a nightingale  in sighs    which perfect joy  perplex d for utterance     stole from her      sister sorrow  might i not tell    of difference  reconcilement  pledges given     and vows  where there was never need of vows     and kisses  where the heart on one wild leap    hung tranced from all pulsation  as above    the heavens between their fairy fleeces pale    sow d all their mystic gulfs with fleeting stars     or while the balmy glooming  crescent lit     spread the light haze along the river shores     and in the hollows  or as once we met    unheedful  tho  beneath a whispering rain    night slid down one long stream of sighing wind     and in her bosom bore the baby  sleep     but this whole hour your eyes have been intent    on that veil d picture  veil d  for what it holds    may not be dwelt on by the common day     this prelude has prepared thee  raise thy soul     make thine heart ready with thine eyes  the time    is come to raise the veil  behold her there     as i beheld her ere she knew my heart     my first  last love  the idol of my youth     the darling of my manhood  and  alas     now

had been written as early as       when it was read to  fitzgerald and spedding   life   i         no alterations were made in  the text after       the story in this poem was taken even to the  minutest details from a prosestory of miss mitford s  namely   the tale  of dora creswell    our village   vol  in            the only  alterations being in the names  farmer cresswell  dora creswell  walter  cresswell  and mary hay becoming respectively allan  dora  william  and  mary morrison  how carefully the poet has preserved the picturesque  touches of the original may be seen by comparing the following two  passages           and dora took the child  and went her way      across the wheat  and sat upon a mound      that was unsown  where many poppies grew                she rose and took      the child once more  and sat upon the mound       and made a little wreath of all the flowers      that grew about  and tied it round his hat          a beautiful child lay on the ground at some distance  whilst a      young girl  resting from the labour of reaping  was twisting a      rustic wreath of enamelled cornflowers  brilliant poppies     round      its hat      the style is evidently modelled closely on that of the  odyssey          with farmer allan at the farm abode    william and dora  william was his son     and she his niece  he often look d at them     and often thought  i ll make them man and wife      now dora felt her uncle s will in all     and yearn d towards william  but the youth  because    he had been always with her in the house     thought not of dora  then there came a day    when allan call d his son  and said      my son  i married late  but i would wish to see    my grandchild on my knees before i die     and i have set my heart upon a match     now therefore look to dora  she is well    to look to  thrifty too beyond her age     she is my brother s daughter  he and i    had once hard words  and parted  and he died    in foreign lands  but for his sake i bred    his daughter dora  take her for your wife     for i have wish d this marriage  night and day     for many years   but william answer d short      i cannot marry dora  by my life     i will not marry dora   then the old man    was wroth  and doubled up his hands  and said      you will not  boy  you dare to answer thus     but in my time a father s word was law     and so it shall be now for me  look to it     consider  william  take a month to think     and let me have an answer to my wish     or  by the lord that made me  you shall pack     and never more darken my doors again      but william answer d madly  bit his lips     and broke away      the more he look d at her    the less he liked her  and his ways were harsh     but dora bore them meekly  then before    the month was out he left his father s house     and hired himself to work within the fields     and half in love  half spite  he woo d and wed    a labourer s daughter  mary morrison       then  when the bells were ringing     allan call d his niece and said   my girl  i love you well     but if you speak with him that was my son     or change a word with her he calls his wife     my home is none of yours  my will is law      and dora promised  being meek  she thought      it cannot be  my uncle s mind will change        and days went on  and there was born a boy    to william  then distresses came on him     and day by day he pass d his father s gate     heart broken  and his father helped him not     but dora stored what little she could save     and sent it them by stealth  nor did they know    who sent it  till at last a fever seized    on william  and in harvest time he died       then dora went to mary  mary sat    and look d with tears upon her boy  and thought    hard things of dora  dora came and said      i have obey d my uncle until now     and i have sinn d  for it was all thro  me    this evil came on william at the first     but  mary  for the sake of him that s gone     and for your sake  the woman that he chose     and for this orphan  i am come to you     you know there has not been for these five years    so full a harvest  let me take the boy     and i will set him in my uncle s eye    among the wheat  that when his heart is glad    of the full harvest  he may see the boy     and bless him for the sake of him that s gone      and dora took the child  and went her way    across the wheat  and sat upon a mound    that was unsown  where many poppies grew     far off the farmer came into the field    and spied her not  for none of all his men    dare tell him dora waited with the child     and dora would have risen and gone to him     but her heart fail d her  and the reapers reap d    and the sun fell  and all the land was dark     but when the morrow came  she rose and took    the child once more  and sat upon the mound     and made a little wreath of all the flowers    that grew about  and tied it round his hat    to make him pleasing in her uncle s eye     then when the farmer passed into the field    he spied her  and he left his men at work     and came and said   where were you yesterday     whose child is that  what are you doing here      so dora cast her eyes upon the ground     and answer d softly   this is william s child       and did i not   said allan   did i not    forbid you  dora   dora said again      do with me as you will  but take the child    and bless him for the sake of him that s gone      and allan said   i see it is a trick    got up betwixt you and the woman there     i must be taught my duty  and by you     you knew my word was law  and yet you dared    to slight it  well  for i will take the boy     but go you hence  and never see me more      so saying  he took the boy  that cried aloud    and struggled hard  the wreath of flowers fell    at dora s feet  she bow d upon her hands     and the boy s cry came to her from the field     more and more distant  she bow d down her head     remembering the day when first she came     and all the things that had been  she bow d down    and wept in secret  and the reapers reap d     and the sun fell  and all the land was dark     then dora went to mary s house  and stood    upon the threshold  mary saw the boy    was not with dora  she broke out in praise    to god  that help d her in her widowhood     and dora said   my uncle took the boy     but  mary  let me live and work with you     he says that he will never see me more      then answer d mary   this shall never be     that thou shouldst take my trouble on thyself     and  now  i think  he shall not have the boy     for he will teach him hardness  and to slight    his mother  therefore thou and i will go     and i will have my boy  and bring him home     and i will beg of him to take thee back     but if he will not take thee back again     then thou and i will live within one house     and work for william s child until he grows    of age to help us   so the women kiss d    each other  and set out  and reach d the farm     the door was off the latch  they peep d  and saw    the boy set up betwixt his grandsire s knees     who thrust him in the hollows of his arm     and clapt him on the hands and on the cheeks     like one that loved him  and the lad stretch d out    and babbled for the golden seal  that hung    from allan s watch  and sparkled by the fire     then they came in  but when the boy beheld    his mother  he cried out to come to her     and allan set him down  and mary said      o father   if you let me call you so      i never came a begging for myself     or william  or this child  but now i come    for dora  take her back  she loves you well     o sir  when william died  he died at peace    with all men  for i ask d him  and he said     he could not ever rue his marrying me      i have been a patient wife  but  sir  he said    that he was wrong to cross his father thus      god bless him   he said   and may he never know    the troubles i have gone thro    then he turn d    his face and pass d  unhappy that i am     but now  sir  let me have my boy  for you    will make him hard  and he will learn to slight    his father s memory  and take dora back     and let all this be as it was before      so mary said  and dora hid her face    by mary  there was silence in the room     and all at once the old man burst in sobs      i have been to blame  to blame  i have kill d my son     i have kill d him  but i loved him  my dear son     may god forgive me   i have been to blame     kiss me  my children    then they clung about    the old man s neck  and kiss d him many times     and all the man was broken with remorse     and all his love came back a hundredfold     and for three hours he sobb d o er william s child     thinking of william  so those four abode    within one house together  and as years    went forward  mary took another mate     but dora lived unmarried till her death

and that the last lines  described the scene from the hill looking over the bay  he saw he said   a star of phosphorescence made by the buoy appearing and disappearing  in the dark sea   but it is curious that the line describing that was  not inserted till long after the poem had been published  the poem   though a trifle  is a triumph of felicitous description and expression   whether we

tennyson informed  a friend that it was not from the  acta sanctorum   but from hone s   every day book   vol  i   pp         that he got the material for this  poem  and a comparison with the narrative in hone and the poem seems to  show that this was the case     it is not easy to identify the st  simeon stylites of hone s narrative  and tennyson s poem  whether he is to be identified with st  simeon the  elder  of whom there are three memoirs given in the  acta sanctorum    tom  i    th january           or with st  simeon stylites  junior  of  whom there is an elaborate biography in greek by nicephorus printed with  a latin translation and notes in the  acta sanctorum   tom  v     th  may           it seems clear that whoever compiled the account  popularised by hone had read both and amalgamated them  the main lines  in the story of both saints are exactly the same  both stood on columns   both tortured themselves in the same ways  both wrought miracles  and  both died at their posts of penance  st  simeon the elder was born at  sisan in syria about a d       and was buried at antioch in a d      or       the simeon the younger was born at antioch a  d      and died in  a d       his life  which is of singular interest  is much more  elaborately related     this poem is not simply a dramatic study  it bears very directly on  tennyson s philosophy of life  in these early poems he has given us four  studies in the morbid anatomy of character   the palace of art   which  illustrates the abuse of aesthetic and intellectual enjoyment of self    the vision of sin   which illustrates the effects of similar indulgence  in the grosser pleasures of the senses   the two voices   which  illustrates the mischief of despondent self absorption  while the  present poem illustrates the equally pernicious indulgence in an  opposite extreme  asceticism affected for the mere gratification of  personal vanity         altho  i be the basest of mankind     from scalp to sole one slough and crust of sin     unfit for earth  unfit for heaven  scarce meet    for troops of devils  mad with blasphemy     i will not cease to grasp the hope i hold    of saintdom  and to clamour  morn and sob     battering the gates of heaven with storms of prayer     have mercy  lord  and take away my sin     let this avail  just  dreadful  mighty god     this not be all in vain that

the cloud     patient on this tall pillar i have borne    rain  wind  frost  heat  hail  damp  and sleet  and snow     and i had hoped that ere this period closed    thou wouldst have caught me up

thou knowest i bore this better at the first     for i was strong and hale of body then     and tho  my teeth  which now are dropt away     would chatter with the cold  and all my beard    was tagg d with icy fringes in the moon     i drown d the whoopings of the owl with sound    of pious hymns and psalms  and sometimes saw    an angel stand and watch me  as i sang     now am i feeble grown  my end draws nigh     i hope my end draws nigh  half deaf i am     so that i scarce can hear the people hum    about the column s base  and almost blind     and scarce can recognise the fields i know     and both my thighs are rotted with the dew     yet cease i not to clamour and to cry     while my stiff spine can hold my weary head     till all my limbs drop piecemeal from the stone     have mercy  mercy  take away my sin     o jesus  if thou wilt not save my soul     who may be saved  who is it may be saved     who may be made a saint  if i fail here     show me the man hath suffered more than i     for did not all thy martyrs die one death     for either they were stoned  or crucified     or burn d in fire  or boil d in oil  or sawn    in twain beneath the ribs  but i die here    to day  and whole years long  a life of death     bear witness  if i could have found a way     and heedfully i sifted all my thought     more slowly painful to subdue this home    of sin  my flesh  which i despise and hate     i had not stinted practice  o my god     for not alone this pillar punishment         not this alone i bore  but while i lived    in the white convent down the valley there     for many weeks about my loins i wore    the rope that haled the buckets from the well     twisted as tight as i could knot the noose     and spake not of it to a single soul     until the ulcer  eating thro  my skin     betray d my secret penance  so that all    my brethren marvell d greatly  more than this    i bore  whereof  o god  thou knowest all        three winters  that my soul might grow to thee     i lived up there on yonder mountain side     my right leg chain d into the crag  i lay    pent in a roofless close of ragged stones     inswathed sometimes in wandering mist  and twice    black d with thy branding thunder  and sometimes    sucking the damps for drink  and eating not     except the spare chance gift of those that came    to touch my body and be heal d  and live

mercy  cover all my sin       then  that i might be more alone with thee         three years i lived upon a pillar  high    six cubits  and three years on one of twelve     and twice three years i crouch d on one that rose    twenty by measure  last of all  i grew    twice ten long weary weary years to this     that numbers forty cubits from the soil     i think that i have borne as much as this      or else i dream  and for so long a time     if i may measure time by yon slow light     and this high dial  which my sorrow crowns      so much  even so  and yet i know not well     for that the evil ones comes here  and say      fall down  o simeon  thou hast suffer d long    for ages and for ages   then they prate    of penances i cannot have gone thro      perplexing me with lies  and oft i fall     maybe for months  in such blind lethargies     that heaven  and earth  and time are choked  but yet    bethink thee  lord  while thou and all the saints    enjoy themselves in heaven  and men on earth    house in the shade of comfortable roofs     sit with their wives by fires  eat wholesome food     and wear warm clothes  and even beasts have stalls     i   tween the spring and downfall of the light     bow down one thousand and two hundred times     to christ  the virgin mother  and the saints     or in the night  after a little sleep     i wake  the chill stars sparkle  i am wet    with drenching dews  or stiff with crackling frost     i wear an undress d goatskin on my back     a grazing iron collar grinds my neck     and in my weak  lean arms i lift the cross     and

   and again in the ninth chapter of the second life   ibid          but this is to be explained perhaps by the moral purpose of the  poem                  the talking oak    first published in       and republished in all subsequent editions with  only two slight alterations  in line     a mere variant in spelling  and  in line      where in place of the present reading the editions between       and      read   for  ah  the dryad days were brief      tennyson told mr  aubrey de vere that the poem was an experiment meant  to test the degree in which it is in the power of poetry to humanise  external nature  tennyson might have remembered that ovid had made the  same experiment nearly two thousand years ago  while goethe had  immediately anticipated him in his charming  der junggesett und der  muehlbach   there was certainly no novelty in such an attempt  the poem  is in parts charmingly written  but the oak is certainly  garrulously  given   and comes perilously near to tediousness         once more the gate behind me falls     once more before my face    i see the moulder d abbey walls     that stand within the chace       beyond the lodge the city lies     beneath its drift of smoke     and ah  with what delighted eyes    i turn to yonder oak       for when my passion first began     ere that  which in me burn d     the love  that makes me thrice a man     could hope itself return d       to yonder oak within the field    i spoke without restraint     and with a larger faith appeal d    than papist unto saint       for oft i talk d with him apart     and told him of my choice     until he plagiarised a heart     and answer d with a voice       tho  what he whisper d  under heaven    none else could understand     i found him garrulously given     a babbler in the land       but since i heard him make reply    is many a weary hour      twere well to question him  and try    if yet he keeps the power       hail  hidden to the knees in fern     broad oak of

  and at my feet she lay        her eyelids dropp d their silken eaves     i breathed upon her eyes    thro  all the summer of my leaves    a welcome mix d with sighs        i took the swarming sound of life      the music from the town      the murmurs of the drum and fife    and lull d them in my own        sometimes i let a sunbeam slip     to light her shaded eye     a second flutter d round her lip    like a golden butterfly        a third would glimmer on her neck    to make the necklace shine     another slid  a sunny fleck     from head to ancle fine        then close and dark my arms i spread     and shadow d all her rest      dropt dews upon her golden head     an acorn in her breast        but in a pet she started up     and pluck d it out  and drew    my little oakling from the cup     and flung him in the dew        and yet it was a graceful gift      i felt a pang within    as when i see the woodman lift    his axe to slay my kin        i shook him down because he was    the finest on the tree     he lies beside thee on the grass     o kiss him once for me        o kiss him twice and thrice for me     that have no lips to kiss     for never yet was oak on lea    shall

is blest     that but a moment lay    where fairer fruit of love may rest    some happy future day       i kiss it twice  i kiss it thrice     the warmth it thence shall win    to riper life may magnetise    the baby oak within       but thou  while kingdoms overset     or lapse from hand to hand     thy leaf shall never fail  nor yet    thine acorn in the land       may never saw dismember thee     nor wielded axe disjoint     that art the fairest spoken tree    from here to lizard point       o rock upon thy towery top    all throats that gurgle sweet     all starry culmination drop

golden year    this poem was first published in the fourth edition of the poems        no alterations were made in it after       the poem had a message for  the time at which it was written  the country was in a very troubled  state  the contest between the protectionists and free traders was at  its acutest stage  the maynooth endowment and the  godless colleges  had  brought into prominence questions of the gravest moment in religion and  education  while the corn bill and the coercion bill had inflamed the  passions of party politicians almost to madness  tennyson  his son tells  us  entered heartily into these questions  believing that the remedies  for these distempers lay in the spread of education  a more catholic  spirit in the press  a partial adoption of free trade principles  and  union as far as possible among the different sections of christianity         well  you shall have that song which leonard wrote     it was last summer on a tour in wales     old

bud     are but as poets  seasons when they flower     yet seas  that daily gain upon the shore         have ebb and flow conditioning their march     and slow and sure comes up the golden year      when wealth no more shall rest in mounded heaps     but smit with freer light shall slowly melt    in many streams to fatten lower lands     and light shall spread  and man be liker man    thro  all

forward and braving the struggle of life  perhaps more simply than anything in  in memoriam    it is not the   ulysses  of homer  nor was it suggested by the  odyssey   the germ  the  spirit and the sentiment of the poem are from the twenty sixth canto of  dante s  inferno   where ulysses in the limbo of the deceivers speaks  from the flame which swathes him  i give a literal version of the

of the  telemachus of the  odyssey        footnote    the happy isles  the  fortunatae insulae  of the romans and  the       greek  ai t on makar on naesoi     of the greeks  have been identified by geographers as those islands in  the atlantic off the west coast of africa  some take them to mean the  canary islands  the madeira group and the azores  while they may have  included the cape de verde islands as well  what seems certain is that  these places with their soft delicious climate and lovely scenery gave  the poets an idea of a happy abode for departed spirits  and so the  conception of the  elysian fields   the  loci classici  on these abodes  are homer  odyssey  iv        seqq            greek  alla s  es elysion pedion kai peirata gaiaes athanatoi    pempsousin

became an allegorical myth   and to attempt to identify and localise  the happy isles  is as great an  absurdity as to attempt to identify and localise the island of  shakespeare s  tempest                     locksley hall    first published in       and no alterations were made in it subsequently  to the edition of       except that in the selections published in       in the third stanza the reading was  half in ruin  for  in the  distance   this poem  as tennyson explained  was not autobiographic but  purely imaginary   representing young life  its good side  its  deficiences and its yearnings   the poem  he added  was written in  trochaics because the elder hallam told him that the english people  liked that metre  the hero is a sort of preliminary sketch of the hero  in  maud   the position and character of each being very similar  both  are cynical and querulous  and break out into tirades against their kind  and society  both have been disappointed in love  and both find the same  remedy for their afflictions by mixing themselves with action and  becoming  one with their kind       locksley hall  was suggested  as tennyson acknowledged  by sir william  jones  translation of the old arabian moallakat  a collection from the  works of pre mahommedan poets  see sir william jones  works  quarto  edition  vol  iv   pp          but only one of these poems  namely the  poem of amriolkais  could have immediately influenced him  in this the  poet supposes himself attended on a journey by a company of friends  and  they pass near a place where his mistress had lately lived  but from  which her tribe had then removed  he desires them to stop awhile  that  he may weep over the deserted remains of her tent  they comply with his  request  but exhort him to show more strength of mind  and urge two  topics of consolation  namely  that he had before been equally unhappy  and that he had enjoyed his full share of pleasures  thus by the  recollection of his past delights his imagination is kindled and his  grief suspended  but tennyson s chief indebtedness is rather in the  oriental colouring given to his poem  chiefly in the sentiment and  imagery  thus in the couplet          many a night i saw the pleiads rising through the mellow shade      glitter like a swarm of fireflies tangl d in a silver braid     we are reminded of  it was the hour when the pleiads appeared in the  firmament like the folds of a silken sash variously decked with gems          comrades  leave me here a little  while as yet  tis early morn     leave me here  and when you

in the distance overlooks the sandy tracts     and the hollow ocean ridges roaring into cataracts       many a night from yonder ivied casement  ere i went to rest     did i look on great orion

hopeless despondency  and meditating self destruction  together with the  manner of its recovery to a more healthy condition  we have two  singularly interesting parallels to it in preceding poetry  the one is  in the third book of lucretius             where the arguments for  suicide are urged  not merely by the poet himself  but by arguments  placed by him in the mouth of nature herself  and urged with such  cogency that they are said to have induced one of his editors and  translators  creech  to put an end to his life  the other is in spenser   in the dialogue between despair and the red cross knight  where despair  puts the case for self destruction  and the red cross knight rebuts the  arguments   faerie queene   i  ix   st  xxxviii  liv           a still small voice spake unto

     after      no alterations were made     this poem was suggested by miss ferrier s powerful novel  the  inheritance   a comparison with the plot of miss ferrier s novel will  show with what tact and skill tennyson has adapted the tale to his  ballad  thomas st  clair  youngest son of the earl of rossville  marries  a miss sarah black  a girl of humble and obscure birth  he dies  leaving  a widow and as is supposed a daughter  gertrude  who claim the  protection of lord rossville  as the child is heiress presumptive to the  earldom  on lord rossville s death she accordingly becomes countess of  rossville  she has two lovers  both distant connections  colonel delmour  and edward lyndsay  at last it is discovered that she was not the  daughter of thomas st  clair and her supposed mother  but of one marion  la motte and jacob leviston  and that mrs  st  clair had adopted her  when a baby and passed her off as her own child  that she might succeed  to the title  meanwhile delmour by the death of his elder brother  succeeds to the title and estates forfeited by the detected foundling   but instead of acting as tennyson s lord ronald does  he repudiates her  and marries a duchess  but her other lover lyndsay is true to her and  marries her  delmour not long afterwards dies without issue  and lyndsay  succeeds to the title  gertrude then becoming after all countess of  rossville  in details tennyson follows the novel sometimes very closely   thus the  single rose   the poor dress  the bitter exclamation about her  being a beggar born  are from the novel     the

satiety  and all that satiety brings in its  train  cynicism  pessimism  the drying up of the very springs of life    the body chilled  jaded and ruined  the cup of pleasure drained to the  dregs  the

              i had a vision when the night was late     a youth came riding toward a palace gate     he rode a horse with wings  that would have flown         but that his heavy rider kept him down     and from the palace came a child of sin     and took him by the curls  and led him in     where sat a company with heated eyes     expecting when a fountain should arise     a sleepy light upon their brows and lips      as when the sun  a crescent of eclipse     dreams over lake and lawn  and isles and capes      suffused them  sitting  lying  languid shapes     by heaps of gourds  and skins of wine  and piles of grapes                then methought i heard a mellow sound     gathering up from all the lower ground         narrowing in to where they sat assembled    low voluptuous music winding trembled     wov n in circles  they that heard it sigh d     panted hand in hand with faces pale     swung themselves  and in low tones replied     till the fountain spouted  showering wide    sleet of diamond drift and pearly hail     then the music touch d the gates and died     rose again from where it seem d to fail     storm d in orbs of song  a growing gale     till thronging in and in  to where they waited     as  twere a hundred throated nightingale     the strong tempestuous treble throbb d and palpitated     ran into its giddiest whirl of sound     caught the sparkles  and in circles     purple gauzes  golden hazes  liquid mazes     flung the torrent rainbow round     then they started from their places     moved with violence  changed in hue     caught each other with wild grimaces     half invisible to the view     wheeling with precipitate paces    to the melody  till they flew     hair  and eyes  and limbs  and faces     twisted hard in fierce embraces     like to furies  like to graces     dash d together in blinding dew     till  kill d with some luxurious agony     the nerve dissolving melody    flutter d headlong from the sky                and then i

lion haunted island lies      a mystic city  goal of enterprise          chapman          i stood upon the mountain which o erlooks    the narrow seas  whose rapid interval    parts afric from green europe  when the sun    had fall n below th  atlantick  and above    the silent heavens were blench d with faery light     uncertain whether faery light or cloud     flowing southward  and the chasms of deep  deep blue    slumber d unfathomable  and the stars    were flooded over with clear glory and pale     i gaz d upon the sheeny coast beyond     there where the giant of old time infixed    the limits of his prowess  pillars high    long time eras d from earth  even as the sea    when weary of wild inroad buildeth up    huge mounds whereby to stay his yeasty waves     and much i mus d on legends quaint and old    which whilome won the hearts of all on earth    toward their brightness  ev n as flame draws air     but had their being in the heart of man    as air is th  life of flame  and thou wert then    a center d glory  circled memory     divinest atalantis  whom the waves    have buried deep  and thou of later name    imperial eldorado roof d with gold     shadows to which  despite all shocks of change     all on set of capricious accident     men clung with yearning hope which would not die     as when in some great city where the walls    shake  and the streets with ghastly faces throng d    do utter forth a subterranean voice     among the inner columns far retir d    at midnight  in the lone acropolis     before the awful genius of the place    kneels the pale priestess in deep faith  the while    above her head the weak lamp dips and winks    unto the fearful summoning without     nathless she ever clasps the marble knees     bathes the cold hand with tears  and gazeth on    those eyes which wear no light but that wherewith    her phantasy informs them  where are ye    thrones of the western wave  fair islands green     where are your moonlight halls  your cedarn glooms     the blossoming abysses of your hills     your flowering capes and your gold sanded bays    blown round with happy airs of odorous winds     where are the infinite ways which  seraph trod     wound thro  your great elysian solitudes     whose lowest depths were  as with visible love     fill d with divine effulgence  circumfus d     flowing between the clear and polish d stems     and ever circling round their emerald cones    in coronals and glories  such as gird    the unfading foreheads of the saints in heaven     for nothing visible  they say  had birth    in that blest ground but it was play d about    with its peculiar glory  then i rais d    my voice and cried  wide afric  doth thy sun    lighten  thy hills enfold a city as fair    as those which starr d the night o  the elder world     or is the rumour of thy timbuctoo    a dream as frail as those of ancient time      a curve of whitening  flashing  ebbing light     a rustling of white wings  the bright descent    of a young seraph  and he stood beside me    there on the ridge  and look d into my face    with his unutterable  shining orbs     so that with hasty motion i did veil    my vision with both hands  and saw before me    such colour d spots as dance athwart the eyes    of those that gaze upon the noonday sun     girt with a zone of flashing gold beneath    his breast  and compass d round about his brow    with triple arch of everchanging bows     and circled with the glory of living light    and alternation of all hues  he stood        o child of man  why muse you here alone    upon the mountain  on the dreams of old    which fill d the earth with passing loveliness     which flung strange music on the howling winds     and odours rapt from remote paradise     thy sense is clogg d with dull mortality     thy spirit fetter d with the bond of clay     open thine eye and see   i look d  but not    upon his face  for it was wonderful    with its exceeding brightness  and the light    of the great angel mind which look d from out    the starry glowing of his restless eyes     i felt my soul grow mighty  and my spirit    with supernatural excitation bound    within me  and my mental eye grew large    with such a vast circumference of thought     that in my vanity i seem d to stand    upon the outward verge and bound alone    of full beautitude  each failing sense    as with a momentary flash of light    grew thrillingly distinct and keen  i saw    the smallest grain that dappled the dark earth     the indistinctest atom in deep air     the moon s white cities  and the opal width    of her small glowing lakes  her silver heights    unvisited with dew of vagrant cloud     and the unsounded  undescended depth    of her black hollows  the clear galaxy    shorn of its hoary lustre  wonderful     distinct and vivid with sharp points of light    blaze within blaze  an unimagin d depth    and harmony of planet girded suns    and moon encircled planets  wheel in wheel     arch d the wan sapphire  nay  the hum of men     or other things talking in unknown tongues     and notes of busy life in distant worlds    beat like a far wave on my anxious ear     a maze of piercing  trackless  thrilling thoughts    involving and embracing each with each    rapid as fire  inextricably link d     expanding momently with every sight    and sound which struck the palpitating sense     the issue of strong impulse  hurried through    the riv n rapt brain  as when in some large lake    from pressure of descendant crags  which lapse    disjointed  crumbling from their parent slope    at slender interval  the level calm    is ridg d with restless and increasing spheres    which break upon each other  each th  effect    of separate impulse  but more fleet and strong    than its precursor  till the eye in vain    amid the wild unrest of swimming shade    dappled with hollow and alternate rise    of interpenetrated arc  would scan    definite round                       i know not if i shape    these things with accurate similitude    from visible objects  for but dimly now     less vivid than a half forgotten dream     the memory of that mental excellence    comes o er me  and it may be i entwine    the indecision of my present mind    with its past clearness  yet it seems to me    as even then the torrent of quick thought    absorbed me from the nature of itself    with its own fleetness  where is he that borne    adown the sloping of an arrowy stream     could link his shallop to the fleeting edge     and muse midway with philosophic calm    upon the wondrous laws which regulate    the fierceness of the bounding element     my thoughts which long had grovell d in the slime    of this dull world  like dusky worms which house    beneath unshaken waters  but at once    upon some earth awakening day of spring    do pass from gloom to glory  and aloft    winnow the purple  bearing on both sides    double display of starlit wings which burn    fanlike and fibred  with intensest bloom     e en so my thoughts  ere while so low  now felt    unutterable buoyancy and strength    to bear them upward through the trackless fields    of undefin d existence far and free       then first within the south methought i saw    a wilderness of spires  and chrystal pile    of rampart upon rampart  dome on dome     illimitable range of battlement    on battlement  and the imperial height    of canopy o ercanopied                               behind     in diamond light  upsprung the dazzling cones    of pyramids  as far surpassing earth s    as heaven than earth is fairer  each aloft    upon his narrow d eminence bore globes    of wheeling suns  or stars  or semblances    of either  showering circular abyss    of radiance  but the glory of the place    stood out a pillar d front of burnish d gold    interminably high  if gold it were    or metal more ethereal  and beneath    two doors of blinding brilliance  where no gaze    might rest  stood open  and the eye could scan    through length of porch and lake and boundless hall     part of a throne of fiery flame  where from    the snowy skirting of a garment hung     and glimpse of multitudes of multitudes    that minister d around it  if i saw    these things distinctly  for my human brain    stagger d beneath the vision  and thick night    came down upon my eyelids  and i fell       with ministering hand he rais d me up     then with a mournful and ineffable smile     which but to look on for a moment fill d    my eyes with irresistible sweet tears     in accents of majestic melody     like a swol n river s gushings in still night    mingled with floating music  thus he spake        there is no mightier spirit than i to sway    the heart of man  and teach him to attain    by shadowing forth the unattainable     and step by step to scale that mighty stair    whose landing place is wrapt about with clouds    of glory of heaven      with earliest light of spring     and in the glow of sallow summertide     and in red autumn when the winds are wild    with gambols  and when full voiced winter roofs    the headland with inviolate white snow     i play about his heart a thousand ways     visit his eyes with visions  and his ears    with harmonies of wind and wave and wood      of winds which tell of waters  and of waters    betraying the close kisses of the wind      and win him unto me  and few there be    so gross of heart who have not felt and known    a higher than they see  they with dim eyes    behold me darkling  lo  i have given thee    to understand my presence  and to feel    my fullness  i have fill d thy lips with power     i have rais d thee nigher to the spheres of heaven     man s first  last home  and thou with ravish d sense    listenest the lordly music flowing from    th illimitable years  i am the spirit     the permeating life which courseth through    all th  intricate and labyrinthine veins    of the great vine of fable  which  outspread    with growth of shadowing leaf and clusters rare     reacheth to every corner under heaven     deep rooted in the living soil of truth     so that men s hopes and fears take refuge in    the fragrance of its complicated glooms    and cool impleached twilights  child of man     see st thou yon river  whose translucent wave     forth issuing from darkness  windeth through    the argent streets o  the city  imaging    the soft inversion of her tremulous domes     her gardens frequent with the stately palm     her pagods hung with music of sweet bells     her obelisks of ranged chrysolite     minarets and towers  lo  how he passeth by     and gulphs himself in sands  as not enduring    to carry through the world those waves  which bore    the reflex of my city in their depths     oh city  oh latest throne  where i was rais d    to be a mystery of loveliness    unto all eyes  the time is well nigh come    when i

come to these parts  and that weren t yesterday   he d come round that there bend a whistling  not sort o  cockahoop  like  some does  but just a cheery sort o   here i am again   and he d always  stop most anywhere  if so be as you held up your hand      i ve seed ladies with their golf clubs runnin  up from the club house   and he d just sort of whistle to show as he seed them  and wait for them  as perlite as any gentleman  for it do be powerful hot to walk back home  with your golf clubs after two rounds  i was a caddy  i was   fore i  went on the line  so i knows what i m telling you      it didn t make no difference if they was champions or duffers what  couldn t carry the burn not if they tried all day  or if it were an old  woman a goin  back from market with all her cabbages and live ducks and  eggs and onions  it were all just the same to little billy      then i mind the day he was took  george he come up and tells me as they  have took billy because the army wants all it can get  i was fair  knocked over  and him so little and all      then the captain  what was the best golfer here  come back for leave       grandpa   says he  same as he always call me   grandpa   he says    i ve been thinking about billy all the time i ve been out  and longing  to hear him whistle again  and now i m home and he s gone  i shall have  to get back to france again to see him       so he will  sir  and if billy was going up right under the german guns  it s my belief as captain would get out of his trench to go and see him      what regiment is billy in  did you say  sir  why  he got no regiment   ain t i been telling you  sir   puffing billy  is what our golfers here  call the little train what used to run six times a day from the town to  the links  just see what the paper says  sir  i don t be much of a  reader  but hark ye to this   i wish also to place on record here the  fact that the successful solution of the problem of railway transport  would have been impossible had it not been for the patriotism of the  railway companies at home  they did not hesitate to give up their  locomotives and rolling stock       that s  puffing billy   sir  him what i ve put the signal down for  hundreds an  hundreds of times  i miss him powerful bad  but the army  wanted him  and we ve been and got some thanks too  i m proud to think  my billy s in the paper

into the war s insatiate melting pot          has to be shot         that was a hard and bitter blow      when first your church bells had to go        those saintly bells that rang carillons      while in the maw of happy millions    pure joy and gratitude to heaven thrilled          for babies killed         it hurt your christian hearts to melt      a source of faith so keenly felt       and now  worse sacrilege than that  you      propose to take yon regal statue     that godlike effigy  and make a gun          of william one         what will  he  say when you reduce      his relative

mutter   ha       they re liquefying grandpapa       the nation s needs  that grow acuter       count sacred things as so much pewter     even my holy crown may go some day          down the red way      o s                                                 le senegalais     samedou kieta sat up in bed with a child s primer open before him    m  a   he spelled  then  after an incredibly long time of patient  puzzling   m  a  ma  oui  ma  y a bon   and embraced the whole ward in  one wide white grin before turning to the next syllable   m  a  n   once  more the puzzled frown on the black face  once more the whispered hints  from neighbouring beds  once more the triumph of perseverance    m  a  n  man   he was just enjoying his success and chanting his  pidgin french paean of happiness   y a bon  y a bon   when soeur  antoinette paused by his bed   tres bien  sidi   she said   mais il faut  les mettre ensemble   and with her white finger she guided his black one  back to the first syllable     here was difficulty indeed  he knew all right that m  a  n was man  but  what was m  a  and when  after intense effort  he re discovered that  m  a spelled ma  it was only to find that he had forgotten what m  a  n  spelled  at last the other wounded could contain themselves no longer   and the ward was filled with laughing shouts of  maman   in which  samedou joined most happily     presently the english nurse passed the negro s bed  and he at once  turned to another branch of learning   good morning   he said  and  when  she smiled back a greeting to him  he added   t ank you   and looked  proudly round him at his fellow patients as who should say   see how we  understand one another  she and i      during a sojourn of many months in the hospital samedou invariably met  the sufferings he was called upon to endure with an uncomplaining  fortitude  which might have seemed due to insensibility had not the  staff had ample proof that his silence was the silence of a fine  courage  on one occasion a set of photographs of the hospital was in  preparation  and when the  salle de pansements  had to be taken the  photographer decided that the best lay figure for his  mise en scene   would be a black man  as a striking contrast to the white raiment of the  staff  so samedou was carried in on a stretcher and laid upon the table   unfortunately the surgeons and nurses were so occupied with the business  of placing things in the best light that no one realised that the poor  senegalese did not understand the purpose of the preparations  and when  the english nurse was called to take up her position she noticed the  hands of samedou kieta clutching the sides of the table and his black  eyes rolling in a sea of white     she at once ran to the nearest ward   quelqu un voudrait bien me preter  une photographie   she asked  and a dozen eager hands offered her the  treasured groups of  la famille   taking one at random she returned to  samedou and held it before his eyes   nous aussi   she said   toi  moi   le major  l infirmier      samedou looked  and a heavenly relief chased the tension from his face    y a bon   he said happily   toi  bon camarade      when his wounds began to be less painful the problem was how to keep the  sidi in bed  no one cared to be very severe with him  so the staff  resorted to the usual weak method of confiscating all his clothes save a  shirt  and hoping for the best  but one day the english nurse  going  unexpectedly into a distant ward  came upon samedou kieta  simply  dressed in a single shirt and a bandage  visiting the freshly arrived  wounded and scattering wide grins around him  at her horrified  exclamation he began to shrivel away towards the door  ushering himself  out with the propitiatory words   good morning  good night  t ank you   water   a most effectual method of disarming reproof     poor samedou has since passed on to another hospital for electric  treatment  but the staff still treasures his first and only letter        moi  samedou kieta  arrive a l autre hopital  y a bon  mais moi   samedou kieta  toi pas oublie  merci  monsieur le major deux  galons  merci  soeur antoinette  merci  madame l anglaise  y a bon   y a bon  y a bon                                                       the germans have suffered         casualties in    days on the      western front

the objections urged on high religious  grounds by lord hugh cecil  the government was probably right in  resisting the proposal  parliament made a mistake in ever giving a  statutory exemption to the conscientious objector  the most that person  could claim was that he should not be called upon to take other people s  lives  he had no right to be excused from risking his own  but having  deliberately provided a loophole it is hardly fair for parliament to  inflict a penalty upon those who creep through it  and so the house  thought  for it rejected the proposal by a two to one

concocting the devastating answers with which mr  balfour  represses impertinent curiosity  accordingly he raked up the old story  of lord hardinge s letter to sir g  buchanan  and inquired what action  the foreign secretary proposed to take  mr  balfour proposed to take no  action  the letter was a private communication  which would never have  been heard of but for its capture by a german submarine  even mr  king s  own correspondence  he suggested  could hardly be so dull that  everything in it would bear publication     mr  king justly resented this imputation  dull  why  only this

interning alien friends without  trial  sir george cave was sorry  but he had never heard of trotsky   there was a certain kautsky  who had been interned  by the germans   perhaps mr  king would

on the kerb in the strand inarticulate and  purple with rage  his face was hardly recognisable  so distorted  were those ordinarily placid features  his eyes were fixed on a  receding taxi     fearing that he might be ill i took his arm  but he flung himself free    don t touch me   he said   i can t bear it   having reached a point in  life when tact is second nature  i waited silently near him until the  storm should have passed     his eyes were still fixed     after a short time he recovered sufficiently to turn to me and explain      i could have killed that fellow   he said      what fellow       that taxi driver  he went by slowly with his flag up and wouldn t look  at me  i hailed him  and i know he heard  but he wouldn t look at me   now i don t mind when they point  or make any kind of sign that they  don t want to be hired  or say that they have no petrol  even if i don t  believe it  but when they won t turn their heads or pay any attention  whatever i could kill them  and there s such a lot of them like that  i  swear   he went on  beginning to go purple again   i swear that  if i  had had a revolver just now  i should have shot him  when one man hails  another

had gone  in this or that conveyance  or on our best  friends in war time  the feet  and that hunt for a taxi  which has now  taken the place of all other sport  was being prosecuted with more or  less energy by a policeman  a loafer and two or three amateurs  all of  whom returned at intervals while the packing up was in progress  to say  how hopeless the case was and how independent the men had become     one passing cab i hailed myself  but he did no more than laugh a loud  laugh of mere incivility and ironically remark   ter morrer    signifying  as i understood it  that nothing on earth should interfere  with his homeward journey that night  since he had done enough and was  tired  but that on the succeeding day  if i still required his services   he was at my disposal     the various bags and parcels being now all ready  we waited patiently in  the hall  and from time to time received reports as to the progress of  the chase     at last  when things seemed really hopeless  a taxi arrived  driven by a  young man in spectacles  which were  i am convinced  part of a disguise  covering one of the noblest personalities in the land  some haroun al  raschid  filled with pity for lost londoners  who is devoting his life  to redressing the wrongs inflicted upon poor humanity by taxi  tyrants  for he said nothing about having no petrol  nothing about the  lateness of the hour  nothing about the direction in which we wished to  go  but quietly and efficiently helped to get the things in and on the  cab  and then drove swiftly away  and when we got to the other end  insisted on carrying some of the bundles up three flights of stairs  and  had no objection to make when asked to wait a little longer and go on  elsewhere     all this time i was  i need hardly say  in a dream  could it be  true  could it     and when he was at last paid off he said both  good night  and  thank  you   although it was i in whom gratitude should have thus vocally  burned  perhaps it did  i was too dazed to remember     how i wish i had taken his number  that all the world might know it and  look for it  assured of a gentleman on the box     iii     so you see there are both

well understand that his life during his  tenure of it cannot have been a pleasant one  every crank with an  infallible recipe for catching sunbeams in cucumber frames and turning  them into potatoes  or whatever might be the fashionable food at the  moment  every grumbler who imagined that every rise in prices must be  entirely due to the malignity of men and not to the scarcity of the  article  every politician with a grudge to satisfy or an axe to  grind  all these pounced upon lord devonport as a victim made ready to  their hands  and gave him a time which can only be described as a very  bad one  add to this the mistakes almost necessarily made by an office  which was entirely new and dealt with unexampled conditions  and it is  not on the whole surprising that difficulties were encountered and that  the right way for overcoming them was not always taken  indeed there was  or there seemed to be at one time a lively controversy between lord  devonport and mr  prothero about the true meaning of the words  maximum   and  minimum  as applied to prices  and we were left to infer that these  latin monsters are virtually indistinguishable from one another     however  all that

trifle  admirably cast as  it was  was diverting in the extreme     of course it is like our mr  galsworthy to assume that things will be as  black as ever a few years hence   tis  no doubt  what

the nursery   heinemann   presents us with mr  eden phillpotts  views on baby culture  the  background of his story  the scenes of which are laid in and around  colchester a year or so ago  is composed of gardens and oyster beds  on  these he gives a lot of information  and  as he could not be pedantic  even if he tried to be  i browsed pleasantly upon the store of knowledge  set before me  also i liked the restraint he shows in dealing with the  war  and commend his exemplary method to some of our more blatant  novelists  when  however  i came to the inhabitants of  the nursery  i  failed to find in them that rare and delightful quality with which mr   phillpotts usually succeeds in endowing his characters  readers of his  novels must know by this time that he is not exactly in love with  mrs   grundy   but here he seems to be insurgent against something  and for  the life of me i don t know quite what it is  perhaps it is insincerity   which is a very good thing to be in rebellion against  there is one very  amusing and delightful character  a bibulous old sinner who defied law  and order and almost at the last gasp ladled out what he considered  justice in a most dramatic manner  his name is  william ambrose   and it  is worth your while to make his disreputable acqaintance                                                 one fact at once awakened in me a fellow feeling for mr  bertram  smith  the discovery of his appreciation  shared by myself  the elder  stevenson  and other persons of discernment  for the romantic  possibilities of the map  there is an excellent map in the beginning of  days of discovery  constable   showing the peculiar domain of  childhood  the garden  in terms that will hardly fail to win your  sympathy  but not in this alone does mr  smith show that he has the  heart of the matter in him  every page of these reminiscences of  nursery life proclaims a genuine memory  not a make believe childhood  faked up for literary ends  who that has once been young can read  unstirred by envy the chapter on  devices and contrivances   with its  entrancing triumph of the chain of mirrors arranged  during the  providential absence of those in authority  from the night nursery   down two flights of stairs  to the store room in the basement  i know a  reviewer whom nothing  but moral cowardice restrained from testing the  possibility of this delightful plan by personal experiment  fireworks  too  mr  smith has remembered them with a proper regard that is  of  course  wholly different from that of those who understand them only in  their pyrotechnic aspect  not as objects loved for themselves alone   for their shape and feel  and the glamour of weeks of hoarding and  barter  in short  a real nursery book for the study  not one perhaps  that actual children would care for  quite possibly they might resent  it as betrayal   but one that for the less fortunate will reopen a door  of which too many of us have long lost the key                                                 what i found strangest in the  transactions of lord louis lewis    murray  is that it is a story  or rather series of stories  about  rogues  in which trickery is invariably vanquished  a refreshing  contrast to the methods of most of our romanticists  who are given to a  certain courtier like attitude towards the lawbreaker  certainly that  various artist  mr  roland pertwee  has contrived to put together a  highly entertaining collection of diamond cut diamond yarns  adventure  tales that have the great advantage  for these days  of being concerned   not with bloodshed and mysterious murders  but with the wiles of dealers  in the spurious antique and the exploits of  lord louis  in defeating  them  this  lord louis  is indeed a very pleasant as well as a very  ingenious gentleman  from the rotundity of his conversational periods  and a certain general suavity of demeanour i suspect him of having made  a careful study of the methods of his distinguished predecessor in  rogue reducing   prince florizel of bohemia   but he is  of course  none  the worse company for that  once  however  he shocked me badly  when  in  perusing an eighteenth century ms   he  i can hardly bring myself to  quote the passage   he  moistened his fingers and turned over three  pages   and this of a nobleman and a connoisseur  oh  mr

usually associated with  such  exploits of the event                                                  you might perhaps allow yourself to be put off by such a title as  home  truths about the war   allen   because it  or something like it  has so  often been used as the preliminary to alarming or disagreeable  statements that we have grown excusably suspicious  but to avoid on this  account the letters that the rev  hugh chapman has here brought together  would be to miss a very original and inspiring little book  let me say  once that mr  chapman  whom you may know is energetic and popular  chaplain of the savoy  also as already  under a pseudonym  an author   has deliberately essayed the impossible  self revelation  especially in  letters  can hardly ever be made convincing  but putting this on one  side  and accepting these  not as the letters that would be written from  one man to another  but rather  to speak without irreverence  such as  the human heart might address to its creator  you will find them full of  interest and encouragement  all sorts and conditions of men and women  are here shown  in their varied reaction to the great acid that for  these three years past has been biting into the life of the world  the  priest  the actor  the profiteer  the society woman  even the  conscientious objector  are all touched lightly  tactfully  and with a  kindly humour that saves the book from its very obvious danger of  becoming pedantic  in his brief preface mr  chapman has crystallised  very happily into a couple of words his ideal for the british attitude  towards the war  buoyant sternness  it is the reflection of that quality  in its pages that gives this little book its tonic value                                                 mr  arnold wright s main work in  early english adventurers in the east    melrose  has been that of making good  most of us know something  at  any rate  of the men who brought our eastern empire into actual  existence  but i tell myself hopefully that my ignorance of those daring  pioneers  whom mr  wright describes as humble adventurers of the  seventeenth century  is not exceptional  it has now been satisfactorily  removed  and  after reading this excellently written history of stirring  deeds  i must believe that even men of learning will thank him for  rescuing many good names from the oblivion which threatened them  and  mr  wright is not only to be congratulated on this act of salvage  but  also on the admirable way in which he has performed it  a restrained  style and a temperate judgment are equally at his command  i cannot  better commend his book to imperialists than by saying that all little  englanders will detest it                                                 on internal evidence i had set down  root and branch   allen and unwin    by r  allatini  as the very clever first book of a very clever and  observant writer of the  alleged  weaker sex  but i find the title page  gives two previous novels to her pen  i still guess a woman s hand  and  i by no means withdraw the  clever   the characterisation of the various  members of the  arenski  family  the branches are better done than the  root  old  paul arenski  k c    idealist and orator  is uncannily good   there s wit and humour and diversity of gifts  what suggested the  first  book  idea was an uncertainty of method  a hesitation between the new  realism and the older romanticism  in both moods the author is  successful  but the joints show something clumsily  this  however  is  technical merely  i commend the book to all who are interested   approvingly or critically  in the jew  a dramatic theme runs through the  book  the ethical question as to whether a man may be justified in  killing  at her passionate request  a woman dearly loved who is slowly  dying of a terrible disease                                                  illustration      angry customer  who has been induced by an advertisement to purchase a  portrait enlargement     your advertisement says   money returned if not  satisfied   i m  not  satisfied  and i want my money back       the eureka portrait company  placidly    i m sorry you don t like  it  madam  but if you will read the advertisement carefully you will  note that it does not specify  who  is to be satisfied  and i assure  you i  am                         this subject  so much to be expected is the unexpected  that i am  quite willing to admit i  may  marry the hurdy gurdy man who plays  beneath my window  i know life well enough to appreciate that i  may   marry a pawnbroker or the sultan of turkey  i assert but one thing  i  shall  not  marry a  man of science       and now  not only had she promised to marry a man of science  but she had  quite overlooked the fact of his being one  and the thing which stripped  her of the last shred of consistency was that she was to marry  not the  every day  average  man of science   but one of the foremost scientists  of all the world  the powers in charge of things matrimonial must be  smiling a quiet little smile to night     but ah  here was the vindication  he had not  asked  her to marry him  he  had simply come and told her she  was  to marry him  and he was a great   strong man  far more powerful than she  she had had positively nothing to  do with it  was it  her  fault that he chanced to be engaged in  scientific pursuits  and when he took her face so tenderly in his two  hands  looked so far down into her eyes  and told her in a voice she  would follow to the ends of the earth that he  loved  her  was there any  time then to think of paltry non essentials like art and science     but she thought of them a little now  how could she get away from them  when each year of her past marched slowly in front of her  paused for an  instant that she might get a full view  and then passed grinningly back  to the abyss of things gone  from over the shoulder tossing straight into  her consciousness a jeering  deep sinking   you too       ernestine stanley  that was the name she read in one of her books open  beside her  why her very  name  stood for that quarrel which had rent all  the years     until she was ten years old she had been nameless  she had been you  and  baby  and dear  and mother s girl  and father s girl  but her mother and  father had been unable to agree upon a name for her  each discussion  served to send them a little farther apart  finally they spoke of  ernestine and reached the point of agreement through separate channels   her father approved it for what it meant in the dictionary   her mother  for the music of its sound  that told the whole story  their attitudes  toward her name spoke for the things of themselves bestowed upon her     her father had been a disciple of exact science   a professor of biology   he believed only in that which could be reduced to a formula  the  knowable was to him the only real  he viewed life microscopically and  spent his portion of emotion in an aggressive hatred of all those things  which he consigned to the rubbish heap labeled non scientific     and her mother  she never thought of her mother without that sad little  shake of her head  was a dreamer  a lover of things beautiful  a hater of  all she felt to be at war with her gods  ernestine s loyalty did not  permit the analysis to go further  except to deplore her mother s  unhappiness as unnecessary  even when a very little girl she wondered  why her father could not have his bottles and things  and her mother have  her poems and the things she liked  and just let each other alone about  it  she wondered that long before she appreciated its significance     as she grew a little older she used to wonder if something inside her  would not some day be pulled in two  it seemed the desire of each of her  parents to guide her from what they saw as the rocks surrounding her   elementary science was all mixed up with keats and heine and byron   another one of her early speculations was as to whether or not poetry and  science really meant to make so much trouble     of course from the very first there had been the blackboard  the  blackboard and all its logical successors  as perversity would have it   it was her father bought her that blackboard  it was to help turn her in  the way she should go  for upon this blackboard she was to do her sums   but the sums executed thereon were all performed when some one was  standing at her shoulder  while many were the hours spent in the drawing  of cats and dogs and fish and birds  of lakes and trees and other little  girls and boys  she never had that being pulled in two feeling when she  and the blackboard were alone together  the blackboard seemed the only  thing which made her all one  and she often wished her father and mother  loved their things as she did hers  for if they were only  sure   as she  was  then what some one else said would not matter at all     they lived in a university town  her father being a professor in the  school  in the later years of her college life he forced her into the  scientific courses which she hated  she sighed even now at the memory of  those weary hours in the laboratory  though while hating the detail of  it  she responded  as her father had never done  to the glimpses she  caught of the thing as a whole  it was ironical enough that the only  thing she seemed to get from her scientific studies was an enthusiasm for  the poetry of science  in those days many thoughts beat hard against the  door of ernestine s loyalty  why did not her mother see all this  and  make her father see it  was there not a point at which they could have  met  and did they not fail in meeting because neither of them went far  enough     it was when she was in her senior year that her father died  she finished  out her laboratory work with lavish conscientiousness  feeling a new  tenderness of him in the consciousness that his ideas for her had failed   that hour before his funeral  when she sat beside him alone  stood out as  among the very vivid moments of her life  the tragedy of his life seemed  that he had failed in impressing himself  his keenness of mind had not  made for bigness  life had left an aggressiveness  a certain sullenness  in the lines of his face  his mind and his soul had never found one  another  was it because his heart had closed the channel between the two     and then they went to new york and ernestine began her study of art     a great light seemed turned back over it all tonight  she understood much  now which she had lived through wonderingly  she seemed now really to  know that girl who went to new york with all the dreams of all her years  calling upon her for fulfillment  she knew what that girl had dreamed  when she dreamed she knew not what  knew what she thought when she thought  the undefined  she smiled understandingly  tenderly  at thought of it  all  the bounding joy and the stubborn determination  the fearing and the  demanding and the resolving with which she began her work  she was a  great deal like a child on the long promised holiday  and much like the  pilgrim at the shrine  somewhere between those two was ernestine that  first winter in new york     it was after the second year  after that strange mixture of things within  her had unified to fixed purpose  and after it had become quite certain  her dreams had not played her false  that the other big change had come   her mother slipped away from the life which had never held her in the big  grip of reality  she had been so long a longing looker on from the outer  circle that the slipping away was the less hard  ernestine stopped work  in order to care for her  reproaching herself with never having been able  to give to her mother with the unrestraint and bounteousness she had  given to her work  during those last weeks she often found her mother s  eyes  sombre  brooding eyes  following her about the room like the spirit  of unrest      try to be happy  ernestine   she said  when about to leave the house in  which she had ever been a stranger   life is so awful if you are not  happy      she took her back to the little town and put her away beside the man with  whom her soul had never been at peace  that first night she awakened in  the dark hours and fancied she heard them quarreling  the hideous fancy  would not let her go to sleep  though she told herself over and over that  surely death would bring them the peace life had so long withheld     she went back to her work then with a new steadiness  loneliness feeding  the fire of consecration  often when alone in her room at night she felt  those disappointed eyes following her about  heard again that plaintive    try to be happy  ernestine  life is so awful if you are not happy   she  had many times opened the book in which her mother copied the poems  written at intervals during the years  but always would come the feeling  of their holding something at which it would be hard to look  to night   with her new understanding  this wondrous new touchstone  she took them  from her trunk with eagerness  she longed now to know the secret of her  mother s life  she would know why happiness had passed her by     there was tragedy in those little poems  a soul s long tragedy in their  halting lines  in the faltering breath with which they were sung  indeed  they were not the songs of a poet at all  they were but the helpless  reaching out of an unsatisfied  unanchored soul  the blackboard had never  given back what it should  the crayon would not write  was it true there  were countless souls who went away like this  leaving unsaid a word they  had craved to say      for our souls were not in tune   was a line she found in one of the  verses and which she sat a long time pondering  was not the secret of it  here  this the rock which held the wreckage of their lives     she left her room and went out of doors  the night was very still   a tender peace brooded over the world  she lifted her eyes to the  stars  her soul to the great wonder  enveloping her was life  drawing her  straight to the heart of things was love  doubts and speculations and  ominous memories seemed blown away by the breath of the night  the years  had no lesson to teach save this  one must love  all that was wrong in  the world came through too little loving  all that was great and  beautiful sprang from love which knew not doubts nor fears  what was a   point of view  when one throbbed with the memory of his good bye kiss     there was a force which moved the world  she was in the grip of that  force to night  all else was but the tiny whirlpool against the mighty  current  and she was not afraid  love would deal kindly with her own   she lifted her soul to the great mother and father of the world   oh take  me and teach me    was her passionate prayer           chapter ii      the letter    what was that story the old greeks told about love being the union  or  reunion  of the two halves of an originally perfect whole  the envious  gods  who were a very bad lot  cut the original perfect being in two   then love is a finding of one s own  also  a getting ahead of the gods  i  have more respect for the old greeks to night than i ever had before  but  you cannot know just how it is  you are younger than i  and i do not  believe the fear of life passing you by ever entered and chilled your  heart  you were always sure it was coming some time  weren t you  my  new found little one  you could not have had that calm  sweet look in  those big eyes of yours had you feared the best of life might be withheld  from you  but can you fancy what it would mean to have felt for many  years that somewhere there was a cool  sweet spring of eternal joy  and  to become fearful your footsteps might never lead you to those blessed  waters  and then can you fancy the profound thankfulness that would fill  one s being  when after long wandering  after several mistakes and  disappointments  the music of those waters was borne to the ear  and  when  almost fearful to believe  and yet very  very sure  one stepped a  little nearer  can you fancy the joy in finding the cooling breeze from  that eternal spring upon one s face  of seeing it there as one had ever  dreamed of it  knowing that beside it one could drink deep  long and very  deep  of those life giving  soul satisfying waters  can you fancy the  all pervading thankfulness  almost unbelievable joy  in that first hour  of standing beside the long desired  the half despaired of water of life      thank god i was not weak enough to resign the whole for the half  there  was once a voice said to me   this is a pretty good spring  there is  not much chance of your finding the other  why not take this   but  something  your voice from a far distance   called me on      a strange enough letter for a man to be writing the girl who has just  promised to marry him  conventionally  i suppose  i should say to you    i never knew anything like this before   and instead i am saying   there  was something once of somewhat similar exterior  but i was mistaken  i  was disappointed   but doesn t this make you see  dear new love  dear   real  love  how happy i am  and why      but you poor little girl  how i ve cheated you  why  liebchen  god bless  the germans for inventing that name for you  you were entitled to weeks  and weeks of beautiful  delicate courtship  will you forgive me for  jumping right over those days when i should have sent you roses and nice  pretty notes  and prepared you in proper and approved way for all of  this  but i had been waiting for you so long that when i found you  i  just couldn t wait a minute longer      and it was georgia  my red headed  freckled  foolish cousin georgia  did this  why  liebchen  i ll take my oath right this minute georgia  hasn t a freckle  i m even willing   oh lord   am  i   yes  by the gods i   am    to read every abominable line she writes for that abominable  paper  am i an ingrate  didn t georgia bring me to  you    and is  anything too much  even to the reading of her stuff  yes  by jove  and   liking  it      now prepare yourself to receive the sympathy of every one you know when  you tell them you are going to marry me  some kind of divine  hallucination is upon you  acting for my good  and you do not see how  profoundly you are to be pitied  but other people will see  and will tell  you about it  only you will think  they  are under a hallucination  which  is one of the phases of  yours   the truth is i am a grubbing old  scientist  i prowl around in laboratories and don t know much of anything  else  and more than half the time my hands are stained with unaesthetic  colours you won t like at all  and they tell me i have a foolish way of  sitting and thinking about one thing  and that sometimes i don t do  things i say i am going to  meet my appointments and things like that   although of course that won t apply to you  and here you might have  married some artist chap  or society fellow who would know all about the  proper thing      but never mind  poor little girl  i ll make it up to you  you may miss  some of the lesser  but you ll have the greater  you ll have the  love that enfolds one s whole being  the love that is eternal  yes   dear  eternal  the mariner has his compass  the astronomer his stars  the  swiss peasant has his alps  and we have our love  it must mean all those  eternal things to us  don t you feel that it will      this train is rushing along jostling my hand so i can scarcely write   but then my heart is rushing on jostling my brain so i can scarcely  think  so perhaps my handwriting matches my thoughts      and we ll work  we ll work to prove how much we love  is there better  reason for working than that  i can work now as i never did before  for  don t i want to prove to this old world that i appreciate its bringing me  to you  and you ll teach me about this art of yours  won t you  my little  girl with the long  serious name  i m ignorant  sweetheart  i don t know  much about pictures  but don t you think that i can learn  why  liebchen   i m learning already  i never knew what they meant by lights and shadows  until i saw your face      but tell me  how does it happen your hair grows back from your temples  that way  why  no one else s hair does that  and where did you learn  about tilting your chin forward like that and looking straight out of  your eyes at one  it is so strange  no one else does any of those things   i ve often thought of the many things in science i do not understand and  never will  but they are the very simplest things imaginable in  comparison with that puzzling way you smile  the wonderful way your face  lights up when you are happy      are you looking up at the stars  i think you are  and in the heavens do  you see one newly discovered  unvanishable star  that is the star of our  love  dear   the star which has changed heaven and earth  are you  dreaming about it all   oh but i know you are  i will fulfill those  dreams  dear girl  i have waited for you too long  i prize you too  inestimably not to consecrate my life to the fulfilling of those dreams            chapter iii      karl    he was one of the men who go before  out in the great field of  knowledge s unsurveyed territory he worked  a blazer of the trail  a  voice crying from the wilderness   i have opened up another few feet   you can come now a little farther   then they would come in and take  possession  soon to become accustomed to the ground  forgetting that  only a little while before it had been impassable  scarcely thinking of  the little body of men who had opened the way for them  and now were out  farther  where again the way was blocked  trying to beat down a few more  of the barriers  open up a little more of that untrodden territory  and  only the little band itself would ever know how stony that path  how deep  the ditches  how thick and thorny the underbrush   why this couldn t have  been so bad   the crowd said  after it had flocked in   strange it should  have taken so long      not that the little band sought popular acclaim  or desired it    heavens   he had once exclaimed to a laboratory assistant  after a  reporter had been vainly trying to persuade him to  tell the whole story  of his work in popular vein     you don t suppose medical research is  going to become a drawing room lap dog      but he need not have feared  a capricious fancy might rest upon them for  the minute  but the big world which followed along behind would never  come into any complete understanding of such as they  in an age of each  man seeking what he himself can gain  how could there be understanding of  the manner of man who would perhaps work all of his lifetime only to put  up at the end the sign board   do not take this road  i have gone over it  and found it profitless   failure is not the name they give to that  they  say his wanderings astray brought others that much nearer to the goal     in his last year at the medical school one of his professors had put it  to him like this   you must make your choice  it is certain you can not  do both  you will become a general practitioner  or you will go into the  research work for which you have shown aptitude here  i am confident you  would succeed as a surgeon  in that you would make more money  and  in  all probability  a bigger name  that is certain  in this other  you take  your chances  but if i were you  i would do whichever i cared for more      that settled it  for he had long before heard the cry from the unknown    come out and take us  we are here  if only you know how to get us    there was in his blood that which thrilled to the thought of doing what  had not been done before  with the abandonment of his intense and rugged  nature  he yielded himself to the delights of the untravelled path     at the time of his falling in love  dr  karl hubers was thirty nine years  old  he had worked in european laboratories  notably the pasteur  institute of paris  and among men of his kind was regarded as one to be  reckoned with  within the profession his name already stood for vital  things  and it was associated now with one of the big problems  the  solving of which it was believed this generation would have to its  credit  the scientific and medical journals were watching him  believing  that when the great victory was won  his would be the name to reach round  the world     three years before  the president of a great university  but newly sprung  up by the side of a great lake  sitting in his high watch tower and with  mammoth spy glass looking around for men of initiative in the  intellectual domain  had spied karl hubers  working away over there in  europe  this man of the watch tower had a genius for perceiving when a  man stood on the verge of great celebrity  and so he cried out now   come  over and do some teaching for us  we will give you just as good a  laboratory as you have there and plenty of time for your own work   now   while he would be glad enough to have dr  hubers do the teaching  what he  wanted most of all was to possess him  so that in the day of victory that  young giant of a university would rise up with the peon   see   we  have  done it   and dr  hubers  lured by the promise of time and facility for  his own work  liking what he knew of the young university  had come over  and established himself in chicago     in those three years he had not been disappointing  he had contributed  steadily to the sum of the profession s knowledge  for he worked in  little by paths as well as on his central thing  and he himself felt   though he said but little  that he was coming nearer and nearer the goal  he had set for himself     his place in the university was an enviable one  the enthusiasm of the  students for him quite reached the borderland of reverence  to get some  work in dr  hubers  laboratory was regarded  among the scientific  students  as the triumph of a whole university career  and it was those  students who worked as his assistants who came to know the fine fibre of  the man  they could tell best the real story of his work  they it was who  told him when he must go to his classes and when he must go to his meals   who kept him  in times of complete surrender to his idea  in so much of  touch with the world about him as they felt a necessity  their hearts  beat with his heart when a little of the way was cleared  their spirits  sank in disappointment as they lived with him through the days of  depression  and as they came day by day to know of the honesty of his  mind  the steadfastness of his purpose  to feel that flame which glowed  within him  they fairly spoke his name in different voice from that used  for other things  and when they told their stories of his eccentricities   it was with a tenderness in their humour  never as though blurring his  greatness  but rather as if his very little weaknesses and foibles set  him apart from and above every one else     generations before  his ancestors up there in north europe had swept  things before them with a mighty hand  with defeat and renunciation they  did not reckon  if they loved a woman  they picked her up and took her  away  and civilisation has not quite washed the blood of those men from  the earth  germany gave to karl hubers something more than a scholar s  mind  at any rate  he did a very unapproved and most uncivilised thing   when he fell in love and decided he wanted to marry ernestine stanley   and that he wanted to take her right over to europe and show her the  things he loved there  he asked for his year s leave of absence before he  went to find out whether miss stanley was kindly disposed to the idea of  marrying him  now why he did that  it is not possible to state  but the  thing proving him quite hopeless as a civilised product is that it never  struck him there was anything so very peculiar in his order of procedure     his assistants had to do a great deal of reminding after he came back  that week  and they never knew until afterwards that his abstraction was  caused by something quite different from germs  they thought  unknowing  assistants  that he was on a new trail  and judged from the expression of  his face that it was going to prove most productive           chapter iv      facts and  higher truth      mr  beason   said georgia mccormick  looking across the dinner table at  the new student who had come to live with them  almost every one who  lived around the university had  students    if you had a dear cousin who  had married a dear friend  if said dear cousin and dear friend had gone  skipping away to europe  and for one year and a half had flitted gayly  from country to country  looking into each other s eyes and murmuring  sweet nothings all the while that  you  had been earning your daily bread  by telling daily untruths for a daily paper  if at the end of said period  said cousin and friend  forced by a steadily diminishing bank account to  return to the stern necessities of life  had written you a nonchalant  little note telling you to  look up a place for them to lay their  heads   which being translated in terms of action meant that you were to  walk the streets looking for vacant houses when vacant houses there were  none  if this combination of circumstances befell you  mr  beason  just  what would you do      beason pondered the matter carefully  mr  beason applied the scientific  method to everything in life  and was not one to commit himself rashly    i think   he announced  weightily   that i would tell them to go to a  hotel and stay there until they could look up their own house       but mr  beason   she rambled on  eyes twinkling  georgia had decided  this young man needed  waking up    suppose you loved them both very  dearly  suppose they were positively the dearest people who ever walked  the earth  and that breaking your neck for them was the greatest pleasure  life could confer upon you  what would you do  then        i m sure i don t know   said beason  bluntly   i never loved any one  that dearly        tis better to love and break one s neck    began harry wyman  who  aspired to the position of class poet      if you had ever known ernestine and karl    a tenderness creeping into  georgia s voice   you d be  almost  willing to hunt houses for them   almost  i say  for i doubt if any affection on earth should be put to the  house hunting test  even my cousin dr  karl hubers            your   cousin     beason broke in    your       in telling the story  georgia always spoke of the unflattering emphasis on the final your  but  at the time she could think of nothing save the transformed face of john  beason  the instantaneousness with which he had waked up was fairly  gruesome  he was looking straight at georgia  all three were held by his  manner      now my dear mr  beason   she laughed finally   don t be so hard on  us  my mother and dr  hubers  mother were sisters  but please don t  rub it in so unmercifully that poor mother has been altogether  distanced in the matter of offspring  you see mother married an irish  politician  hence me  while aunt katherine  karl s mother  married a  german scholar  therefore karl  and the german scholar was the son of a  german professor  in fact  from all i have been led to believe the hubers  were busily engaged in the professoring business at the time julius  caesar stalked up from italy       now georgia   hastened mrs  mccormick earnestly   this newspaper work  gives you such a tendency to exaggerate  i never heard it said before  that the family went  that  far back       perhaps not  but just because a thing has never been said before  isn t  there all the more reason for saying it now  and i m just trying to make  mr  beason understand   demurely   why some people are scholars and  others are not      but season s mind was working straight from the shoulder      does he ever come here   he demanded      yes  indeed  he honours our poor board quite often with the light of his  countenance      beason accepted that as unextravagant statement of fact      well  do you  know about him   he asked  bluntly      that he s  way up  oh  my  yes  and we re tremendously proud of him       i should think you would be   said beason  rather grimly      karl is indeed remarkable   said mrs  mccormick  blandly expansive  well  pleased with both karl and her own appreciation of him   i feel that our  family has much to be proud of  to think both he and georgia have done so  well with their work      the expression of beason s face was a study  georgia laughed over it for  weeks afterwards      now my chief interest   said wyman  who was at the stage where he put  life in capital letters  and cherished harmless ideas about his own  deep understanding of the human heart   is in mrs  hubers  there  i  fancy    it was his capital letter voice   is a woman who understands       a dandy girl   said georgia  briskly      she has the artistic temperament   he pursued      oh  not disagreeably so   she retorted      you see   turning to beason  who was plainly impatient at this shifting  to anything so irrelevant as a wife   i play quite a leading part in dr   hubers  life  i m his cousin  that s the accident of birth  but i handed  over to him his wife  for which he owes me undying gratitude  i m looking  for something really splendid from europe       i wish i hadn t gone home so early that spring   sighed wyman   i d like  to have seen that little affair  it must have been the real thing in  romance       but it was nothing of the sort  it was the most disgraceful thing i ever  had anything to do with       now georgia   protested her mother   you know you are so apt to be  misunderstood       well i couldn t be misunderstood about this  oh  it was awful   the  suddenness of it  you know  you see miss stanley was an old college  friend of mine  in fact  i roomed at their house    she paused and seemed  to be thinking of other things  serious things   a year ago last spring    she went on   ernestine stopped here on her way home from new york  her  parents had died  but an old aunt lived in their house  and she was going  to see her  i had always told her about karl  but she had never met him   because when ernestine and i were together so much  he was in europe  so  i wanted her to meet him  well  principally because he was a good deal of  a celebrity  and i thought it would be nice  i ll be real honest and  confess it never occurred to me there would be anything exciting doing   well  karl didn t want to come  first he said he would  and then he  telephoned he was busy  so i just went over to the laboratory and  got   him  i told him he was expected  and if he didn t come  mother and i  never would forgive him  he washed his hands and came along  grumbling  all the way about how one s relatives interfered with one s life  oh   karl and i are tremendously frank  and then when he got here  well  i ll  just leave it to mother       he did seem to be greatly impressed with georgia s friend   said mrs   mccormick  consciously conservative      i never saw him act so stupid  oh  but i was mad at him  i wanted him to  talk about europe and be brilliant  but he didn t do anything but sit and  look at ernestine  fact of the matter is  ernestine doesn t look quite  like the rest of us  at least karl thought she didn t  and evidently he  made up his mind then and there he was going to have her  ernestine left  chicago sooner than he thought she was going to  and what does he do but  go after her  and get her  you see  all of karl s ancestors weren t meek  and gentle scholars and wise professors  lots of them were soldiers and  bloodthirsty brigands  and those are the ones he brags about most and in  spite of his mind  and all that  those are the ones he is most like  i  suppose it was in the blood to get what he wanted  i m sure i don t  know how he did it  lots of men had wanted ernestine  and she had the  caring for her art notion  she s made good tremendously  you know  but  art took a back seat when dr  hubers arrived on the scene  that s all  there is to it  i wouldn t call it a romance  it was more in the line of  a hop  skip and jump      she had pushed back her chair a little  but laughed now  reminiscently      oh it was just too funny  some of it was too rich to keep  karl came  here the day after he returned  wanted to hear me talk of ernestine  you  know  people in love aren t exactly versatile in their conversation  i  did talk about her for two hours  and then i ventured to change the  subject   karl   i said   what do you think of the colour they re  painting the new fifty seventh street station       he had been sitting there in rapt silence and he looked up at me with a  seraphic  far away smile   colour   he said  dreamily   was there ever  such a colour before        there certainly never was   i replied  meaning of course the brick red  of the aforesaid station       that divine brown   he pursued   that soft  dark  liquid brown of  unfathomable depth   now there   nodding laughingly at beason   you have  a sample of the great dr  hubers  mighty intellect      beason hovered around  hoping for a few more stray words  but as harry  wyman and georgia were talking about some foolish newspaper affairs  he  went to his room and tried to settle down to work     a half hour later wyman  who had also gone in to do a little studying   came out to where georgia was looking over the other evening papers      say   he laughed   you ve got to do something for that fellow in  there  he s crazy as a loon  you ve got him all stirred up  and if you  don t go in and get him calmed down he won t sleep a wink to night  and  neither will i  he says dr  hubers is the greatest man in the world  he  says he won t except anybody  no  sir  not a living human soul  he s been  walking up and down the floor talking about it  gee  you ought to hear  him  he says he came to this university on purpose to get some work with  dr  hubers  that his life will be ruined if he doesn t get it  and that  he s going to make all kinds of a ten strike  if he does  and you can t  laugh at the fellow  for he s just dead down in earnest  he wanted me to  come out here and ask you some questions  i can t remember  em straight   how he worked  whether he was approachable  oh  he fired them at me  thick  say now  he would appreciate it  if you d just go in and give him  a little talk about your cousin  kind of serious talk  you know  why   he d just hang on every word      and georgia  laughing  georgia was strongly addicted to laughing  said if  there was any man ready to hang upon her every word  that she  being  twenty seven and prospectless  must not let him get away     she told beason many things  some of them facts and some of them  higher  truth   georgia holding that things which ought to be true were higher  truth  she told him how karl had tried to burn down his father s house   when a very small boy  to see if something somebody had said about fire  was true  how he dissected a strange and wonderful bird which came to the  house on a visitor s hat  how he inspired a whole crew of small boys to  run away from home as explorers  how he whipped a bigger boy most  unmercifully for calling the germans big fools  georgia arranged for her  cousin what she called a thoroughly consistent childhood  and then some  less high truth about his working his way through college  getting money  enough to go abroad  his absolute forgetfulness of everything when  immersed in work  facts and higher truth tallied here      karl s queer   she said   he s roasted a good deal by the academic  folks  pooh hoos a lot of their stuff  you know  he seems to have a  strange notion that science  learning  the whole business is for  humanity  unique conception  isn t it      after she went away  beason said he had no doubt that when one came to  know miss mccormick  he would see  in spite of her lightness of manner   that she had many fine qualities      qualities   burst forth the enthusiastic wyman   say  you just  ought to hear the newspaper fellows talk about georgia mccormick  i  tell you she s a peach  and more than that  she s a brick  she s the  divide her last penny kind  georgia mccormick is  and i want you to know  that if ever any one had the joy of living stunt down pat  she s it  it s  an honest fact that if she was put in the penitentiary and you went to  see her after she d been there awhile  she d tell you so many funny and  interesting things about the pen  that you d feel sore to think you  weren t in yourself  and  smart   and a hustler  well  her paper s done  some fool things  but it s had sense to hold on to  her  all right all  right      and beason replied that of course dr  hubers  cousin was bound to be  smart           chapter v      the home coming     yes  suh  chicago only two hours  suh   and the porter smiled broadly   there was both memory and anticipation in that smile     the car was almost empty  across the aisle a man slept peacefully  a  little farther ahead a young lady read of the joys and sorrows of a  knight and his lady who had lived some several hundred years before  and  still farther on a lady all in black was looking from the window   evidently lost to sorrows of more recent date  as no one was paying any  attention to the man and woman back there in the rear of the car it was  perfectly safe  when the porter passed on  for her hand to slip over into  his     he responded with that quiet  protecting smile which always made it seem  no bad thing could ever come to her      almost home  dear   he said  and then for a long time neither of them  spoke  many big forces flowed freely into the silence of that moment     she looked up at him at last with a smile which broke from her  seriousness as a ripple breaks from a wave      suppose we had to say everything in words       suppose we had to walk on one leg       oh  but that  you know  karl  it s a little like the rivers and the  ocean  the words are the rivers flowing into the ocean of silence  rivers  flow into oceans  but do they  make  them  and then the ocean gives back  to the rivers in the things which it breathes out  there are so many  reasons why it seems like that       ernestine  where did you get all this  i sometimes think i m not square  with you at all  why  i ve been in all those places before  i saw the bay  of naples long before i ever saw you  and yet i didn t really see it  before at all  don t you see  eyes and appreciation and every decent  thing i take from you  where did you get it all  ernestine      she pushed back a little curl which was always coming loose   he loved  that little curl for always coming loose      perhaps i  got it  from that way you have of looking at me  the way  you re looking at me now  or maybe i got it from the way you say   ernestine   the way you said it just now  but does it matter much what  comes from which    with which bit of lucidity she wrinkled up her nose  at him in a way which always vanquished argument and returned to the  silence which seemed waiting to claim her     he watched her then  he loved so to do that  just see how far he could  follow  ernestine seemed to draw things to her in a way very wonderful to  him      you know  liebchen    as he saw that steady light of resolution shine  through the veil of her tenderness   it seems so queer to me that you  really  do  anything       well for a neatly turned compliment        i mean it seems so queer you should really  amount  to anything       now before you overwhelm me with further adulation  what  are  you  talking about       i m talking about your being an artist  i can t get used to your being  anything but  ernestine   that day last spring when we went to see your  salon picture  and when those chaps were talking to you  and i realised  that they just simply accepted you as one of them  that you belonged  and  that that was all there was about it  i  oh i had such a funny feeling  that day  and now  a minute ago  when i saw that look  i had it again       why  karl  you don t  mind   do you       no  it s just that it seems queer  you see you re such a wonderful  sweetheart  it s hard to think of you as anything else  i ll never forget  that day over there  something just seemed to leap up within you  i  well  i think i was a little scared  or was i awed  something that was shining  from your eyes made me feel things in my backbone       but you re glad   she laughed      of course i m glad  and i m proud  but it s  queer      she smiled at him understandingly  the understandingness of her smile  always went beyond her words  it was a beautiful face upon which he  watched the play of lights  saw the changing currents of thought and  dreams and purpose  but the thing most rare in it  that which made one  quite forget accepted standards  was the steadfastness with which a  certain great light shone through the aura of her tenderness  there were  moments in which she transcended both her beauty and her beauty s  weaknesses     as the flower to the sun  naturally  quietly  inevitably  she had  expanded under the breath of life  with the fullness of a rich nature she  had responded to the touch of the spirit of living  love loved her for  what she had been able to take     and in the year which had passed  life  with tender rather than defacing  lines  had put upon her face the touch of sorrow  europe meant more to  her than an old world civilisation  more than tradition  beauty or art   it even meant more than the place where she had spent those first dear  months of her love  it meant to her the place where she had hoped with  woman s dearest hope  and where she had given up the child which should  have been hers  her tenderest  deepest thoughts were not of the wonders  and beauties she had seen  they were of the dreams within  of the holy  happiness of first knowledge  and then the grief in giving up the much  desired  which she had known only in anticipation  the most cherished  memories of their love were memories of those days in which he had  comforted her  of the tenderness with which he had consoled  the strength  with which he had upheld  those hours had reached far into her soul   deepening it  giving her  as if in compensation  new channels for love   new understanding of those innermost things of life  but in those first  days  even while the soul of the woman was deepening  the bruised heart  was as the heart of a child  it was as a child she had been to him in  those days  and he had comforted her as one would comfort an idolised  child  whose hurt one strove to take wholly unto one s self  the memory  of those hours knit them together as no other thing could have done     looking down at her face now he saw that look he had come to know  that  far away  frightened  wistful look  very gently he laid his hand upon her  knee      i am going to make you so happy  life is going to be so beautiful   he  said     she smiled at him  but the tears were in it      yes  karl  i know  but now that we are coming home  together  alone   doesn t it seem       he turned away  the man had suffered too      and we are leaving it over there  over there  alone  away from us  the  life that should have been       with that he turned resolutely back to her      ernestine  isn t there another way to look at it  it came of our love   and now  dear  it has gone back into our love  it isn t something apart  from us   something gone  we have taken it back unto ourselves  it is  here with us  the greater love we have  that is it  dear      the flame of understanding leaped quickly to her eyes      oh  i like that karl   she whispered   i like that better than anything  you ever said      she turned then and looked from the window  across the fields  over near  the horizon  she could see a little house  the smoke was curling from the  chimney  the autumn twilight had come on and they had lighted the lamp  a  bit of home  the tears came to her eyes  tears of tender anticipation   she too was to make a home  and was it not good to think that smoke was  coming from many chimneys and many lamps were being lighted  was it not  good to feel that the dear world was full of homes     to the man this coming back to chicago  returning to his work after the  year and a half he had been away  was charged with a happy significance   as they drew nearer and nearer  an impatience possessed him to begin at  once  that desire of the worker to start in immediately  he had worked  some over there  had done a few things which were most satisfactory  but  he wanted now to settle down to actual work in his old place   with his  own things  he fell to wondering if they had changed the laboratory   resentful at the possibility      why look here  ernestine   he suddenly burst forth  turning to her  eagerly   to morrow s a school day  we re late getting home  everything  is in swing  they re waiting for me  and  by jove  i can just as well as  not begin to morrow      a woman who never made one feel things in one s backbone might have  resented the quick  eager plunge into work  but ernestine knew the love  of work herself  and her eyes brightened to his spirit      but dear me  karl   after a second s hesitation   it seems you should  take a day or two first       why   he demanded      well    vaguely   to get rested up       rested up   he stretched forth his arm and then doubled it back  and  they both laughed   that s a joke  my getting rested up  why i feel like  a fighting cock       and crazy to get to work       getting that way  oh  i tell you  ernestine  there s nothing like it      again she did not mind  she understood  she looked at his glowing face   all alight with enthusiasm for the work to which he was going back  she  was never tired of thinking how karl s face was just what karl s face  should be  reflective of a clear cut  far seeing  deeply comprehending  mind  it seemed all written there  all those things of mind and  character  and something too of those other things  the things which  were for her alone  ernestine held that one could tell by looking at karl  that he was doing some great thing      but see here  dr  hubers  a nice way you have of shirking your domestic  duties  who is going to help me settle this famous house georgia tells  about       i ll do it at night   he protested eagerly   i ll work every night until  the house is spick and span      ernestine sighed   i have a sad feeling that our house never will be  spick and span  but we ll have some fun    eagerly   fixing it up       of course we ll have fun fixing it up  georgia s sure to be on hand  and  i ll make old parkman get busy too  do him good       i don t care about knowing a lot of men        well i should  hope  not      you didn t let me finish  i was going to say that dr  parkman is one man  i do want to know       you ll like parkman  and he ll like you  by jove  he s got to  you  mustn t mind if he snaps your head off occasionally  his life s made  him savage  but even his life  he s had an awful one  ernestine  couldn t  make him vicious  he s the gruffest  snarliest  biggest man i ever  knew  meaner than the devil  and the best friend on top of earth  and  lord  how he works  i don t know any other three men could swing the same  load  and i tell you  ernestine  he s great  there s not a better surgeon  in all europe  parkman s a tremendous help to me  oh  it s going to be   great  to get back       we have some really nice things for our house   mused ernestine   i m  glad we decided to take that rug for the library  of course it seemed  pretty high  but a library without a nice rug wouldn t do at all  not for  us       no  that s right  library without a rug  now i wonder if i am to have my  old eight o clock lecture hour  i  want  that hour  i want to get all the  school business out of the way in the morning  i must have plenty of  uninterrupted time for myself  i tell you what it is  ernestine  i m  going to  get  it  what i saw over there of the other fellows makes me  all the more sure of myself  and coming back now after being made all  over new  you see there s such a thing as inspiration in my work  just as  there is in yours  of course it s work  work  work  work your way through  this and that  but there s something or other that leads you on  and i   know  i m going to do something now       i know it too  karl   she responded  and the steadfastness shone strong  through the tenderness now   we all know it       i ve got to   he murmured   got to   and then his whole mind seized upon  it  some suggestion had come to him  some of that inspiration of which he  had spoken  he sat there looking straight ahead  brows drawn  eyes  sometimes half closing  occasionally nodding his head as he saw a point  more clearly  he looked in such moments as though indeed made for  conquest   indomitable  one could almost feel his mind at work  could  fancy the skillful cutting away of error  the inevitable working ahead to  truth     at last he turned to her   there s no reason for not beginning  to morrow   he said  with the eagerness of a boy who would try a new gun  or fishing rod   there are a whole lot of things i want to get right  at now            chapter vi       gloria victis      we ll just put our russian friend back here in the corner  where the  shelf suppresses him   said georgia  who seemed to have accepted the  self appointed position of head cataloguer   some of the students might  happen to call       this   said dr  parkman  who was dusting gibbon s rome   is the sort of  thing that is called the backbone of a library       consequently   replied georgia glibly   we will put it up here on the  top shelf  nobody wants a library s backbone  it s to be had  not read   now the trimmings  like our friend mr  shaw here  must be given places of  accessibility      the host was picking his way around among the contents of a box which he  had just emptied upon the floor  the hostess was yielding to the  temptation of an interesting bit which had caught her eye in dusting  an  attic philosopher in paris       now here   said dr  hubers  picking up a thick  green book   is walt  whitman and that means trouble  no one is going to know whether he is  prose or poetry       when art weds science   observed georgia   the resulting library is  difficult to manage  mr  haeckel and mr  maeterlinck may not like being  bumped up here together       then put haeckel somewhere else   said ernestine  looking up from her  book      no  fire maeterlinck   commanded karl      see   said georgia   it s begun  strife and dissension have set in       i m neither a literary man nor a librarian   ventured dr  parkman   but  it seems a slight oversight to complete the list of poets and leave  shakespeare lying out there on the floor       got my goethe in   asked karl  after shakespeare had been left immersed  in georgia s vituperations      i think browning and keats are over there under the encyclopedia  britannica   said ernestine  roused to the necessity of securing a  favourable position for her friends      observe   said georgia   how they have begun insisting on their  favourite authors  this is one of the early stages      ernestine  looking over their shoulders  made some critical remark about  the place accorded balzac s letters to madam hanska  which caused  georgia to retort that perhaps it would be better if people arranged  their own libraries  and then they could put things where they wanted  them  then after she had given a resting place to what she denounced as  some very disreputable french novels  she leaned against the shelves and  declared it was time to rest      this function   she began   will make a nice little item for our  society girl  usually she disdains people who do not live on the lake  shore drive  but she will have to admit there is snap in this  dr  and  mrs  karl ludwig hubers     pounding it out on a copy of walden as  typewriter     but newly returned from foreign shores  entertained last  night at a book dusting party  those present were dr  murray parkman   eminent surgeon  and miss georgia mccormick  well and unfavourably known  in some parts of the city  rug beating and other athletic games were  indulged in  the hostess wore a beautifully ruffled apron of white and  kindly presented her guest with a kitchen apron of blue  beer was served  freely during the evening        is that last as close as your paper comes to the truth   asked  ernestine  piling up emerson that he might not be walked upon      that last  my dear  is a hint  a good  straight from the shoulder hint   i did it for dr  parkman  he looks warm and unhappy      dr  parkman protested that while a little warm  he was not at all  unhappy  but upon further questioning as to thirst was led into damaging  admissions  so the little party divided  georgia calling back over her  shoulder that as the host was of teutonic origin  there need be no fear  about the newly stocked larder     left alone a curious change came over the two men  they had entered with  the heartiness of schoolboys into the raillery of a few minutes before   but all of that dropped from them now  and as they pulled up the big  chairs and dr  parkman s  well   brought the light of a great enthusiasm  to the face of his friend  drawing him into the things he had been so  eager to reach  one would not readily have associated them with the  flippant conversation from which they had just turned     for here were men who in truth had little time for the lighter  gayer  things of life  they stood well to the front in that proportionally small  army of men who do the world s work   tommy  rot    dr  parkman had  responded a few days before to a beautiful tribute some one was seeking  to pay  the doctor    a doctor is a man who helps people make the best of  their bad bargains  and damned sick he gets of his job  a man must make a  living some way  so some of us earn our salt by bucking up against the  law of the survival of the fittest  thereby rendering humanity the  beautiful service of encumbering the earth with the weak  if the medical  profession would just quit its damn meddling  nature might manage  in  time  to do something worth while      but all the while  by day and by night  at the expense of leisure and  pleasure   often to the exclusion of sleep and food  he kept steadily at  his  damn meddling    proving the most effective enemy nature had in that  part of the country  and sadly enough  for his philosophy  he was even  stripped of the vindication of earning his salt  in the one hour a day  given to his business affairs  dr  parkman made more money than in the  ten or twelve devoted to his profession  men said he had financial  genius  and he admitted that possibly he had  stipulating only that  financial genius was an inflated name for devil s luck  he liked the  money game better than poker  and played it as his pet dissipation  his  one real diversion  but having more salt than he could use during the  remainder of his days  did not tend toward an abatement of this war he  waged against nature s ultimate design  he himself would analyse that as  a species of stubbornness  an egotistic desire to see how good an  interference he could establish  but he gave body and brain and soul to  his meddling with a fire suspiciously like consecration     they all knew that dr  parkman worked hard  some few knew that he  overworked  and a very few knew why  of the personal things of his own  life he never spoke  and though he was but fifty  his lined face and  deep set eyes made him seem much closer to sixty     the two men were an interesting contrast  dr  parkman was singularly   conspicuously dark  while karl hubers was a true teuton in colouring  dr   parkman was a large man  and all of him seemed to count for force   something about him made people prefer not to get in his way  it was his  hands spoke for his work  superbly the surgeon s hands  that magical  union of power and skill  hands for the strongest grip and the lightest  touch  lithe  sure  relentless  fairly intuitive  his hands made one  believe in him     with karl it was the eyes told most  they seemed to be looking such a  long way ahead  and yet not missing the smallest thing close at hand  as  he talked now  his face lighted with enthusiasm  it occurred to dr   parkman that hubers was a curious blending of the two kinds of men there  were behind him  some of those men had been fighters and some had been  thinkers  but karl was the thinker who fights  he had drawn from both of  them  and that gave him peculiar fitness for the work he was doing  it  was work for the thinker  the scholar  but work which must have the  fighting blood  even his appearance bore the mark of the two kinds of  things bequeathed him  he had the well knit body of the soldier  the face  of the student  he was not a large man  but he gave the sense of large  things  he had the slight stoop of the laboratory  but when interested   aflame  he straightened up and was then in every line the man who fights   his eyes  to the understanding observer  told the story of much work  with the microscope  they were curiously  though not unattractively   unlike  the left he used for observations  the right for making the  accompanying drawings  that gave them a peculiarity only the man of  science would understand     the things which the two men radiated were different things  one felt  their different adjustment toward life  dr  parkman had turned to hard  work as some men turn to strong drink  to submerge himself  to take him  out of himself  to make life possible  while with karl hubers  work and  life and love were all one great force  dr  parkman worked in order that  he might not remember  karl in order that he might fulfill     their friendship had begun ten years before in vienna  one of those rare  friendships which seem all the more intimate because formed in a  foreign land  a friendship taking root in the rich soil of kindred  interests   comradeship which drew from the deep springs of  understanding  to come close to karl s work had been one of the real joys  of dr  parkman s very active but very barren life   he loved karl  his  own heart was wrapped up in the work his friend was doing  and the doctor  meant much to karl  had done much for him  the one was the man of  affairs  the other the man of thought  they supplemented and helped each  other  as the practicing physician  dr  parkman could see many things  from which the laboratory man would be shut out  he was karl s channel of  communication with the human side of the work  and karl gave parkman his  complete confidence  that was why there was so much to tell now  he must  go over the story of his year s work  touch upon his plans  his new  ideas  and the doctor had something to say of the observations he had  made for karl  he told of an operation day after to morrow he must see  and said he had several cases worth watching      you will have to come out to the laboratory   karl finally urged   we  can t begin to get at it here       we re forgetting the hungry and thirsty men   said georgia  after they  had been eagerly chatting across the kitchen table for ten or fifteen  minutes  but ernestine said it did not matter  she knew what was going on  in the library and how glad they were of their chance  she and georgia  too had much to discuss  the work done in europe  georgia s work here   how splendid karl was  what a glorious time they had had  something of  the good times they would all have together here  and then this house  which georgia had found for them and into which they had gone at once      i knew well enough   she said  buttering a sandwich in order to stay  her conscience   that you and karl didn t belong in a flat  there  couldn t be a studio and a laboratory and library and various other  exotic things in a flat  but only old settlers and millionaires live in  detached houses here  so please appreciate my efforts  i thought this  place looked like you  not that you re exactly old fashioned and  irregular       i liked it at once  big enough and interestingly queer  and not  savouring of chicago enterprise       not that there is anything the matter with chicago enterprise   insisted  georgia      you like chicago  don t you  georgia       love it  i know one doesn t usually associate love with chicago  but i  love even its abominations  you know i had a tough time here  but i won  out  and most of us are vain enough to be awfully fond of the place where  we ve been up against it and come out on top  i haven t forgotten the  days when i edited farm journals and wrote thirty cent lives of great men  and peddled feature stories from office to office  standing with my hand  on door knobs fighting for nerve to go in  but now that it is all safely  tucked away in the past  i m not sorry i had to do it  it helps one  understand a few things  and when new girls come to me i don t tell them   as i was told  that they d better learn the millinery trade or do honest  work in somebody s kitchen  none of that kind of talk do they get from  me      it was always absorbing to see georgia very much in earnest  her alert  face kept pace with her words  and her emphatic little nods seemed to be  clinching her thought  people who had good cause to know  said it was  just as well not to turn the full tide of her emotions to wrath  she was  a little taller than ernestine  very quick in her movements  and if one  insisted on an adverse criticism it might be admitted she was rather  lacking in repose  the people who liked her  put it the other way  they  said she was so breezy and delightful  but even friendship could not deny  her freckles  nor claim beauty for her bright  quick face     they seemed to fall naturally into more serious things when they met over  what georgia called the evening bite  although differing so widely  they  were homogeneous in that all were workers  they touched many things   their talk live with differences      how do you like it   asked ernestine  following dr  parkman s eyes to  her favourite bronze  a copy of mercie s gloria victis  which she had  unpacked just that day and given a place of honour on the mantel      it s so christian   he objected laughingly      oh  but is it       a defeated man being borne aloft  i call it the very essence of  christianity  i can see submission and renunciation and other  objectionable virtues in every line of it       go after it  parkman   laughed karl   ernestine and i all but came to  blows over it  i wanted her to buy a napoleon instead  i tell her there  is no glory in defeat       i don t think of it as the glory of defeat   said ernestine   i think of  it as the glory of the conquered       but even so  ernestine   said georgia  who had been looking it over  carefully   there s no real glory  when i fall down on an assignment  i  fall down  and that s all there is to it  at least my city editor thinks  so  if dr  parkman doesn t win a case  he loses it  his efforts may have  been very worthy  but gloria s surely not the word for them  or take a  football game   she laughed   sometimes the defeated team really does  better work than the winners  but wouldn t we rather our fellows would  win on a fluke than go down to defeat putting up a good  steady fight   the thing is to  get there        in football or in life   laughed karl   defeat furnishes good material  to the poets and the artists  but none of us care to have the glory of  the conquered apply to  us       they were all looking at the bronze and ernestine looked from one face to  another  trying to understand why it moved none of them as it had her   karl s face was very purposeful tonight  reflecting the stimulus of his  talk with his friend  filled with enthusiasm for this fight he was  making  he had no eye in this hour for the triumph of the vanquished      why i don t want to submit   he laughed just then   i want to win       an idea which has done a great deal of harm   observed dr  parkman    that  you ll get your reward somewhere else  doctrine is the worst  possible armour for life  the poets  of course  have always coddled the  weak  but i see more poetry in the to hell with defeat spirit myself      that too she could understand  a simple matter of the arrogance of the  successful     and with georgia it was that thing of  getting there   the world s hard  and fast standards of success and failure     she too turned to the statue  were they right  and she wrong  was it just  the art of it  the effectiveness  which moved her  and was the thought  back of it indeed weakening sentimentality      defend it  ernestine   laughed karl  and then  affectionately  seeing  her seriousness   tell us what  you  see in it      dr  parkman turned from the statue to her  he never forgot her face as it  was then     he had decided during the evening that her great charm was her exquisite  femininity  she seemed to have all those graces of both mind and body  which make for perfect loving  it was the world force of love  splendidly  manifest in gentleness  he had felt in her first  but now something new  flamed up within her  here was power  power moving in the waves of  passion through the channel of understanding  her face had grown fairly  stern in its insistence      but don t you  see  the keynote of it is that stubborn grip on the  broken sword  i should think every fighter would love it for that  and it  is more than the glory of the good fight  it is the glory of the  unconquerable will  look at the woman s face  the world calls him  beaten   she  knows that he has won  i see behind it the world s  battlefields   way back from the first i see them all  and i see that the  thing which has shaped the world is not the success or failure of  individual battles one half so much as it is this wresting of victory  from defeat by simply  breathing  victory even after the sword  has been broken in the hand  what we call victory and defeat are  incidents  things individual and temporal  the thing universal and  eternal is this immortality of the spirit of victory  why  every time i  look at that grip on the broken sword    laughing now  but eyes  shining   i can feel the world take a bound ahead            chapter vii      ernestine in her studio    the next morning she went to work  she had never wanted anything with  quite the eagerness that she wanted to work that morning      what i want to know is   georgia had demanded the night before   did  either of you do any work  i hear a great deal about quaint little  villages and festive cafes  but what did you actually do      now if georgia were only here to repeat the question  she could answer  jubilantly   what did i do  why  i got ready for this morning  wasn t  that a fine year s work      it had seemed queer at first   why don t i work   she would ask karl    now that i am here where i always wanted to be   but karl would only  laugh  and say that was too obvious to explain  once he had talked a  little about it   i wouldn t worry  liebchen  isn t it possible that the  creative instinct is being all used up  it s your dream time  sweetheart   it s your time to do nothing but love  after a while you ll turn to the  work  and you ll do things easily then that were hard to do before      how had he known  for nothing had ever been more true than that  she knew  this morning that she could do things easily now which had been hard to  do before     one of the very best things about this curious  old fashioned house was  that it had an attic which had all the possibilities of a studio  just a  little remodeling  and paris itself could do no better     to that attic she turned just as soon as karl had gone over to the  university  her things had been carried up  now for a fine morning of  sorting them out  but instead of attacking the unpacking and sorting and  arranging she got no farther than a book of her sketches  sitting down on  the floor she spread them all around her     despite the fact that she had not at once settled down to serious work   she made sketches everywhere  just rough  hasty little things   bubbles  of joy  she called them to karl  it seemed now that these were counting  for more than she had thought  everything was counting for more than she  had thought     something of the joy of it carried her back to the days when she was a  little girl and had had such happy times with her blackboard  the thought  came that now  out of her great happiness  she must pay back to the  blackboard all that it had given her in those less happy days  work was  but the overflow of love     during the last five months  when karl had been working in paris  she had  studied with laplace  he had taken her in at once  rejoiced in her and  scolded her  one day in an unguarded moment he said she knew something  about colour  no one remembered his ever having said a thing like that  before  and ernestine had seen a teardrop on his face when he stood  before her picture of rain in the autumn woods  that teardrop was very  precious to her  it seemed she could work years on just the memory of it     so there were many reasons why she felt like working this morning  all  the loving and the living and the dreaming and the thinking and the  working of a lifetime  karl had understood  her dream time  she loved  that way of putting it  beautiful days to be cherished forever  how rich  she was in the things she had known  how unstinted love had been with  her  she wanted now to give with that same largeness  that same  overwhelming richness  with which she had received  enthusiasm and desire  and joy settled to fixed purpose  she began upon actual work     she kept at it until late in the afternoon  she had never had such a day   and the great thing about it was that it seemed a mere beginning  just an  opening up  a new day had dawned  a day which meant  not the death of the  dream days  but their reincarnation into life  those hours when she sat  idly beneath blue skies  looking dreamily out upon beautiful vistas it  seemed she should have been painting  how well  after all  they had done  their work  dreams which she had not understood were making themselves  plain to her now  the love days were translating themselves in terms of  life and work  she wanted to glorify the world until it should be to all  eyes as the eyes of love had made it to her     laplace had said once it was too bad she had married  she thought of that  now  and smiled  she was sorry for any one who thought it too bad she had  married     and then karl telephoned  would she come over to the university  he had  been wanting to show her around  and this would be a good time  she  dressed hurriedly  humming a little song they had heard often in paris           chapter viii      science  art  and love    from his window in the laboratory he saw her as she was coming across the  campus  and waved  she waved back  and then wondered if it were proper to  wave at learned professors who were looking from their windows  in one  sense it was hard to comprehend that it was her karl who was such an  important man about this great university  karl was so completely just  her karl  so human and dear  and a great scientist seemed a remote  abstraction  she must tell that to karl  he would enjoy himself as a  remote abstraction     she was still smiling about karl s remoteness as she came into the  building  he had come down to meet her   you see i thought you might get  lost   he explained      i might have   she responded  and then laughed  for when people are very  happy it is not at all difficult to laugh      do you know what you look like   he said   you look like a kind of  spiritualised rainbow  or like the flowers after the rain       i dressed in five minutes   said ernestine  smoothing down her gown with  the complacency of a woman who knows she has nothing to fear from  scrutiny      as if that had anything to do with it  you dress as the birds and  flowers dress  by just being yourself      she let that bit of masculine ignorance pass with a wise little smile     they were in the laboratory now   i came   said ernestine severely   to  listen to an elucidation of the mysteries of science       then you had no business to come looking like this   he responded  promptly     she was looking around the room   and this is where all those great  things are done       um  well this is where we make attempts at things      he was not quite through  and ernestine sat down by the window to wait  for him  it seemed surprising  somehow  that it should be such a simple  looking room  karl was doing something with some tubes  writing something  on a chart like thing  something in the expression of his face as he bent  over the work carried her back to other days      karl   she said abruptly   why don t you and i have any quarrels about  which is greater  science or art      he looked up at her in such absolute astonishment that she laughed      liebchen   he said   don t you think that would be going a long way out  of our road to hunt a quarrel  now i can think up much better subjects  for a quarrel than that  for instance  do i love you more than you love  me  or do you love me more than i love you  your subject makes me think  of our old debating society  we used to get up and argue in thunderous  tones something about which was worse  fire or water       but karl  it isn t logical that you and i should love each other this  way      he pushed back his work and turned squarely around to her  he was smiling  in his tenderly humorous way   well  sweetheart   he said   would you  rather be logical  or would you rather be happy       oh  i m not insisting upon the logic  i m just wondering about it       isn t love greater than either a test tube or a paint brush   karl asked  softly     she nodded  smiling at him lovingly     he sat there looking a long way ahead  she knew he was thinking something  out   ernestine   he began   do you ever think much about the  oneness   of the world       why  yes  i do  but i didn t suppose you did       but  liebchen  who would be more apt to think about it than i  doesn t  my work teach oneness more than it teaches anything else  all the  quarrelling comes through a failure to recognise the oneness  i often  think of the different ways goethe and darwin got at evolution  goethe  had the poetic conception of it all right  darwin worked it out step by  step  who s ahead  and which has any business scoffing at the other      he went back to his notes  and her thoughts returned to the battles she  had heard fought in the name of science  she looked about the room  out  at the great buildings all around  and then back to karl  who seemed soul  of it all  how different all this was  what would her father think to  hear a man like karl hubers giving to a poet place in the developing of  the theory of evolution  what  was  the difference between karl and her  father  was it that the school to which they belonged was itself  changing  or was it just a difference in type  or  perhaps  most of all   was it not a difference in degree  her father had only seen a little way   and that down a narrow path bounded by high walls of bigotry  karl had  reached the heights from which he could see the oneness  and was it not  love had helped him to those heights     a little later  when karl was seeking to explain what he evidently  regarded as a very simple little thing  and just as a few glimmers of  light were beginning to penetrate her darkness  she looked up and at the  half open door saw a boy whose consternation at sight of her made it  difficult for ernestine to repress a smile      come in  beason   said karl  who had just noticed him   i want you to  meet mrs  hubers   ernestine looked at karl suspiciously  something in  his voice signified he was enjoying something     but there was nothing about mr  beason which signified any kind of  enjoyment  he advanced to meet her sturdily  as one determined to do his  duty at any cost  the boy was rendered peculiar in appearance by an  abnormally long  heavy jaw  which gave his face a heavy  stolid  appearance which might or might not be characteristic  he had small   sharp eyes  and ernestine was quite sure from one look at his face that  he did not laugh often  or see many things to laugh about     he was not impenetrable to graciousness  however  for within five minutes  he had told her that he was born in southern indiana  that he lived in  minneapolis now  and that he had come to chicago to get some work with  dr  hubers  upon hearing that ernestine immediately noticed what a  remarkably intelligent face he had  and felt sure that that heavy jaw  gave him a phlegmatic look which was most misleading     karl laughed as the boy went away   funny fellow  beason  he ll have to  cut away a lot of the trees before he gets a good look at the woods   never in his life has one gleam of humour penetrated him  in fact if a  few humour cells were to creep in by mistake  they d be so alien as to  make a tremendous disturbance       he seems to think a great deal of you   said ernestine  a little  reproachfully      oh  yes  and i like him  i like the fellow first rate  he s a splendid  worker  conscientious  absolutely to be depended upon   way ahead of lots  of these fellows around here who think they know it all  but he has those  uncompromising ideas about science  ready to fight for it at the drop of  the hat  oh  beason s all right  we need his sort  i ll tell you whom i  do want you to meet  ernestine  and that s hastings  you ll like him   he s such a success as a human being  he s more like the old time  professor of the small college  has a fatherly  benevolent feeling toward  all the students  you see we re so big here that we haven t many of the  small college characteristics about us  it s each fellow doing his own  work  and not that close comradeship that there is in the small school   but hastings is a connecting link  then  on the other hand  there s lane   you must meet him too  for he s a rare specimen  pedantic  academic  i  don t know just why they have him  he doesn t represent the spirit of the  place at all  he s entirely too erudite to be of much use  but i ll let  parkman tell you about lane  oh  but he hates him  they met here in the  laboratory one day and upon my soul i thought parkman was going to pick  him up and throw him out the window      as they were looking through the general laboratory they met professor  hastings  and she could see at once what karl meant  he was apparently a  man of about sixty  and kindness was written large upon him  ernestine  could fancy his looking after students who were ill  and trying to devise  some way of helping the poverty stricken boy through another year in  college     they left the building and sauntered slowly across the campus  almost in  the centre of the quadrangle ernestine stopped and looked all around  she  was beginning to feel what it was for which the university of chicago  stood  it was not  college life   all those things vital to the  undergraduate heart  which this university suggested  she fancied there  might be things the undergraduate would miss here  she was even a little  glad her own college days had been spent at the smaller school  as she  stood looking about at building upon building she had visions  not of  boys and girls singing their college songs  but of men and women working  their way toward truth  she looked from one red roof to another  and each  building seemed to her a separate channel through which men were working  ahead to the light  it was a place for research  for striving for new  knowledge  for clearing the way  she turned her face for the moment to  the north  there was great chicago  where men fought for wealth and  power  chicago  with all the enthusiasm of youth  and the arrogance of  youthful success  with all the strength of youthful muscle  all the power  and possibility of young brain and heart  this seemed far away from the  board of trade  from state street and michigan avenue  but was not the  spirit of it all one  this  too  was chicago  the chicago which had  fought its way through criticism  indifference and jeers to a place in  the world of scholarship  people who knew what they were talking about  did not laugh at the university of chicago any more  it had too much to  its credit to be passed over lightly  men were doing things here  she  felt all about her the ideas here in embryo  how would they develop   where would they strike  what things now slumbering here would step   robust and mighty  into the next generation     and greatest of all these was karl  she turned to him with flushed   glowing face  he had been watching her  following much of her thought    i like this place   she said  her eyes telling all the rest   i was not  sure i was going to  but i do            chapter ix      as the surgeon saw it     but  karl  you  must        i tell you  my dear  i can t       well  i think it s just        now  ernestine    in tones maddeningly calm and conciliatory   you go on  down to parkman s office and i ll come just as soon as i can  now be  sensible  there s a good girl       well  i call it  mean     this after hanging up the receiver   i don t  care    still talking into the telephone  as if there were satisfaction  in having something understand   it s not  nice  of karl      they had an engagement with dr  parkman for dinner at his club  to meet  some people he wanted her to know  and now karl had telephoned from the  laboratory at the last minute that he was not ready to leave and for her  to go on down alone      and he ll come late  and not dressed  and they ll think    she went over  and sat down by the window to enjoy the mournful luxury of contemplating  just what they would think     couldn t he go over to the laboratory a little earlier in the morning and  finish up this terribly important thing  was it nice of a man to have  people being  sorry  for his wife  was it considerate of karl to ask her  to put on this pearl coloured dress and then let her go down in the train  all alone     she would telephone dr  parkman that they could not come  then karl would  be sorry  but no  severely and with dignity  she would show that one  member of the family had some sense of the conventions  oh  yes  this in  long suffering vein  she would do  her  part  and would also do her best  to make up for karl  no doubt she might as well become accustomed to that  first as last     going down in the train she had a very clear picture of herself as the  poor  neglected wife of the man absorbed in his work  she saw so many  reasons for being unhappy  was it kind the way karl had told her in that  first letter about some other woman in his life  and then had never so  much as revealed to her that other woman s name  where did this woman  live  when had karl known her  how  well  had he known her  and all the  while her sense of humour was striving to make attacks upon her and the  consciousness in her inmost heart that all this was absurd and most  unworthy only made her the more persistently forlorn     she had never been to dr  parkman s office  and she was not very familiar  with chicago  had it never occurred to karl she might get lost and have  some unfortunate experience  but fate did not favour her mood  and she  reached the office in safety  dr  parkman did not seem at all surprised  at seeing her alone  which flamed the fire anew      he hasn t backed out   he demanded  laughing a little     she explained with considerable dignity that her husband had been  detained at the laboratory  that he regretted it exceedingly  but would  be with them just as soon as circumstances permitted     he took her into his private office  and ernestine was too sincere a  lover of beautiful things to be wholly miserable in a room like that      why  this doesn t look like an office   she exclaimed   it s more like a  pet room in a beautiful home      he laughed  not mirthfully      i hardly think you could call it that  but this is where i spend a good  deal of my time  so i tried to make it livable      he was busy at his desk  and she watched his hands  she was thinking that  she would like to paint a picture and call it  the surgeon   she would  leave the man s face and figure in shadow  concentrating the light upon  those hands  letting them tell their own story     the whole man stood for force  she was sure that he always had his way  about things  that he simply took for granted having his own way  yet  there was something in which he had not had his way  karl had told her a  little about that  she must ask him more about it  it seemed suddenly  that there was something pathetic about this beautiful room  did it not  reflect a man trying to make up to himself for the things he did not  have  it was a room which suggested pleasant hours and fine  quiet  enjoyment  the deep  leather chairs seemed made for long  intimate  conversations  the dark red tapestry  the oak panelling  this richly  toned rug  the few real pictures  the little odds and ends suggestive of  remote corners of the world  it seemed a setting for some beautiful  companionship  some close sympathy  a place where one would like to sit  for hours and be just one s self  but was not dr  parkman s life lacking  in the very things of which this bespoke an appreciation  there was a  subtle pathos in a beautiful room which breathed loneliness  she thought  of their own library at home  quick to sense the difference     the doctor went into an adjoining room  and her thoughts were broken by  the low murmur of voices  then the inner door opened  he was showing a  man through to the outer office  the man stumbled over the rug  and at  his exclamation ernestine looked up  her own face paled  she half rose  from her chair   the native impulse to do something  she looked at dr   parkman  his face was entirely masked  the man passed into the outer  room  leaving behind him something which caused ernestine s heart to beat  fast     the doctor walked slowly over to his chair and sat down  he seemed  unconscious of her for a moment  and then he looked at her and saw that  she had seen and that she wanted to know      you d think a man would get used to it   he said in his short  gruff  way   you d think it would become a matter of course  but it doesn t   that man s wife is dying of cancer  it s not an operable case  i told him  that to day  he asked for the truth and i gave it  i even gave my  estimate of the time   he swung his chair around and looked out at the  roof of the building below  and then turned sharply back to her   you  said a while ago that this looked like a home  well  it s not  it s like  a good many other things  empty show  where that man lives  it s not much  for looks  but it  is  a home  and this means  breaking it up  in there a  minute ago  i told him he had to lose the only thing in life he cares  anything about  he  oh  well   and with one of his abrupt changes  he  turned away     but ernestine was leaning forward in her chair  her lips were parted  her  eyes were very dark      cancer  you say  doctor    her voice was so low he could barely catch  it   cancer      he nodded  looking at her intently      but that s what karl s working on  that s what karl s doing this very  minute       yes  and do you ever think of it like that  do you ever think of the  lives and homes he is going to save  the tragedies and heartbreaks he is  going to avert  the children he is going to keep from being motherless or  fatherless if he does do this thing   and i believe with all my heart  he will  i tell you  mrs  hubers  you want to help him  i m not sorry  you saw that little thing just now  it will show you the other side of  it  the human side  and there wasn t anything unusual in it  all over the  world  physicians are doing this same thing every day  telling people  it s hopeless  admitting there s nothing to be done  then think of the  tremendousness of this work karl hubers is doing   where it strikes  the  hearts breaking for it  the thousands praying for it  is it any wonder  we re watching it  interested  i tell you  we  know what it means      she was unconscious of the tear on her cheek  of the quivering of her  face      and karl is doing that   that  is what karl s work means       karl s work simply means giving into our hands the power to save more  lives  now we re doing the best we can with what we have  but god knows  we re short on power  we re groping around in the dark  karl s work means  letting in the light      his voice had grown warm  something had fallen from him  leaving him  himself  in his eyes was a wealth of unspeakable feeling      doctor  i want to thank you    but it was her face thanked him most  eloquently     she was glad when he left her for a minute before they finally went away   her heart was very full  this was karl  this the real meaning of karl s  work  to think she had looked at it in that small  paltry way  that even  in her thoughts she had put the slightest stumbling block in his path   this very afternoon had come new inspiration and she had resented it  had  said small  mean things in her heart because he stayed to work out his  precious thoughts  why  it would have been fairly criminal for karl to  run away from that call of his work     she wanted to tell him all about it  she yearned to  make it up to him    make him more happy than he had ever been before  she dwelt upon it all  until  when dr  parkman came in for her  he was startled at the light  shining from her face           chapter x      karl in his laboratory    one of their favourite speculations  as the days went on  was as to  whether any one had ever been so happy before  they argued it from all  sides  in a purely unprejudiced and dispassionate manner  and always  arrived at the conclusion that of course no one ever had   because    ernestine would say   no one ever had so many reasons for being happy     and if they had   he would respond   they would have said something  about it      ernestine worked that winter as she had never worked before  that first  day had not been a deceptive one  she had done some of the things which  something within her heart assured her that day she could do  the best  thing she had done she sent to laplace  as he had asked her to   it s  considered rather superior to disdain the salon   she said to karl  the  day they packed the canvas   but paris seems the only way of proving to  americans that good can come out of america      she had heard from laplace that the picture would be hung  his brief  comment had been that america could not be so bad as was sometimes said   she was eager now to hear more about it  she would surely have a letter  very soon  and she and karl were so happy  it had been such a glorious   wholesome  splendidly worth while winter     it was one afternoon in early spring that over in the laboratory john  beason and professor hastings were talking of dr  hubers   but that isn t  all of it   said professor hastings in the midst of a discussion   this  fanaticism for veracity huxley talks about isn t all of it by any means   any of us can get together a lot of facts  it takes the big man to know  what the facts mean       somebody said that truth was the soul of facts   said beason  in the  uncertain way he talked of anything outside tabulated knowledge   but i  suppose that s just one of those things people say       yes  but is it  isn t it true  why is hubers greater than the rest of  us  it isn t that he works harder  we all work  it isn t that he s more  exact  we re all exact  isn t it that very thing of having a genius  for getting the soul out of his facts  that man looks a long way  ahead  smells truth away off  as it were  i tell you  mr  beason   scientific training kills many men for research work  they re afraid to  move more than inch by inch  they won t take any jumps  now dr  hubers  jumps  i ve seen him do it  of course  after he s made his jump he goes  back and sees that there aren t any ditches in between  but he s not  afraid of a leap in the dark  that s his own peculiar gift  most of us  are not made for jumping       but that doesn t sound like the scientific method   said beason  brows  knitted      i ll admit it wouldn t do for general practice   replied the older man   a twinkle in his eye   the spirit has to move you  or you wouldn t gain  anything but a broken neck       yes  but that thing of a spirit moving you   said beason  more sure of  himself here   that does not belong in science at all  that is a part of  religion       and to a man like dr  hubers   very quietly and firmly   science is  religion      beason pondered that a minute   they re entirely distinct   was his  conclusion      so it seems to you  but i m a year or two older than you are  mr   beason  and the longer i live the more firmly i believe that there is  such a thing as an intuitive sense of truth  if there isn t  why is dr   hubers a greater man than i am    and with that he left him  smiling a  little at how it had never occurred to beason to say anything polite     beason was in truth much perturbed  it was not pleasing to have the  greatness of his idol explained on unscientific principles  he did not  like that idea of the jumps  jumping sounded unscientific  and what could  be worse than to say of a man that he was not scientific  preposterous to  say the greatest things of science were achieved by unscientific methods     to day dr  hubers had been all afternoon alone in his laboratory  some  one had brought him in some luncheon at noon  but since one o clock the  door had not opened  and now it was almost five  what was going on in  there  even beason had the imagination to wonder     could he have seen he would not have been much enlightened  the man was  sitting before a table  his arms reaching out in front of him  some  tubes  his microscope  other things he had been working with within  reach  but unheeded now  for he was not seeing now the detail  the  immediate  this was not one of those moments of advancing step by step   the light in those eyes of wonderful sight was the light from a farther  distance  a way had opened ahead  far out across dim places he could see  it now  the afternoon had been a momentous one  he had taken a step  leading to a greater height  and with the greater height came a wider  vision  a few of those minutes such as he was living now fires a man for  months  yes  years  of work  ahead were days when the fires of  inspiration would be in abeyance  when the work would be only a working  of step by step  detail  some would call it drudgery  but it is in these  moments of inspiration man qualifies for the fight  in the hours of  working onward toward the light he may grow very weary  but he can never  forget that one day  for just a moment  the light opened to him  moments  such as karl hubers was living now mark the great man from the small     and his glowing moment was more than a promise  it was also a reward  it  was spring now  and all through the winter he had worked hard  he had  come back in the fall determining in the gratitude of his great happiness  to do the best work of his life  he pulled his microscope over in front  of him and looked over it after the manner of one dreaming  how many days  he had come to it eager to note the slightest significance in its  variations of colour  for the staining of the slides made colour count in  his work almost as it did in ernestine s  only to be met with the  non essential  more of the husk and no sight of the kernel  he smiled a  little to think what a bulky and stupid volume it would make were he to  write down all he had done  if each hope  each possibility  each  experiment and verification were to be put down  he could quite rival in  bulk a government report  and if added to that should be a report of the  cases he had watched  the operations he had attended  the attempts at  getting living matter and of working with dead  how large and how useless  that volume would be were it to contain it all  he had done days and days  of useless work to get the slightest thing that was significant     only the week before ernestine had laughingly read him an article one of  the popular magazines printed on cancer research  the whole thing is  becoming a farce  so said the popular magazine  every once in a while  some man issues a report saying the germ is in sight  then another man  appears with a still more learned report saying it is not a germ at all   all doing different things  and all sure they are on the right track   meanwhile the disease is on the increase  surgery cannot meet it  satisfactorily  and while laboratories pursue the peaceful tenor of their  way  men and women are dying hard deaths which no one seems able to stay   truly  the man behind the microscope is a very slow man the article had  concluded     no doubt that seemed true  he could see the writer s point of view well  enough  the things the man behind the microscope did accomplish sounded  so very easy that the on looker could give only indolence and stupidity  as the reason for not accomplishing a great deal more     and even from his own point of view  with his own knowledge of all the  facts in the case  he had no doubt that once done it would sound so easy  that he would stand amazed to think it had not been done before  let the  unknown become the known  and even the trained worker cannot look upon it  as other than a matter of course  it was so easy now to meet diphtheria   strange they had let so many children die of it  it was so very easy now  to give a man an anesthetic  fearful how they had let a man suffer  through every stroke of the knife  or die for need of it  should he blame  the man outside for looking at it that way when even to him things  accomplished took on that matter of course aspect     he began putting away his things  it was ernestine s birthday  and he had  promised to be home early  for they were going to the theatre   it will  be like all the rest   he mused   once done  it will seem so easy that we  will wonder why it was not done long before   again the fire leaped high  within him  to do it  perhaps after all he did see it too complexly  he  must not let the husk dull his eye to the kernel  a man building a  beautiful tower must erect a scaffold  but the scaffolding should not  make him forget the tower  some way in this last hour his mind had seemed  to clear  his immense amount of useless work was not hanging about his  neck like a millstone  something had cut that away  he was free from it  all  he could feel within himself that his approach to his problem was  better than it had been before  perhaps he had made the mistake of the  others of looking at it as something fearfully complex  something it  would be the hardest thing in all the world for any man to do  it all  looked more simple now  it was as if muscles strained to the point of  tenseness had relaxed  and in an easy and natural way he foresaw victory  as a logical part of his work     he was happy to night  light hearted  the windows of the laboratory were  open to the soft air of that glorious day of early spring  and his spirit  was open too  open to the soul of the world  taking unto itself the sweet  and simple spirit of the men who have done the greatest things  from his  window he could see one of the tennis courts  some of the students were  playing   good   he exclaimed enthusiastically to himself  as he watched  a return that had looked impossible  he was glad they were playing  tennis  why shouldn t they     professor hastings heard him whistling softly to himself  a german love  song  as he walked through the big laboratory  and catching a glimpse of  the younger man s face  he nodded his head and smiled  it had been a  good afternoon  that was plain  now let there be more afternoons like  this  and then  to think it should be done right here under his very  eyes  was not that joy enough for any man     on the steps of the building karl stopped suddenly  put his hand in his  inner pocket and drew out a small box  yes  it was there all right  and a  girl passing up the steps just then was amazed and much fluttered to  think dr  hubers should be smiling so beautifully at her  in fact   dr  hubers did not know that the girl was passing  she had simply been in  the direction of his smile  and he was smiling because it was ernestine s  birthday  and because he had so beautiful a present for her  he walked  along very fast  he could scarcely wait to see her face when he gave it  to her  too bad he had kept her waiting so long           chapter xi      pictures in the embers    they were back home now      why  mary has intuitions   laughed ernestine  when she saw that a fire  had been lighted in the library  and was in just the proper state for  seeing pictures   a girl who knew we would want a fire has either been in  love or ought to be  at any rate  she knows we are       this is the kind of a night when a fire serves artistic purposes only   you don t need it  so you have to enjoy it all the more       still  these spring evenings are damp   she insisted  defending the  fire   it doesn t feel at all uncomfortable       and looks immense   he added  turning down the gas and pulling up a seat  just right for sitting before the fire     she leaned over  holding her hand so close to the flame that he wondered  at first what she was doing      see   she cried   see my ruby in the firelight  karl  it s just a piece  of it right up here on my hand       and i suppose    seeming to be injured   that during the remainder of my  life  i may play second fiddle to that ring  oh  ernestine  you re a  woman  i was mortified to death at the theatre  you didn t look at the  play at all  you just sat and looked down at that ring  oh  i saw through  that thing of not being able to fasten your glove      she was twisting her hand about to show off the stone  any woman of any  land who has ever owned a ring knows just how to do it      see  dear   she laughed exultantly   it  is  fire  you can see things in  it just as you can in the coals      but he was not looking at the ring  there were things to be seen in her  face and he was looking at them  he loved this child in her  was it in  all women when they love  he wondered  as many other men have wondered of  other women  or was it just ernestine      it was a dreadful thing for you to get it   she scolded   these  affectionate scoldings were a great joy to him   it s a ridiculous thing  for a poor college professor  that s you  to buy a ruby ring  why  rubies  exist just to show millionaires how rich they are  and it s a scandalous  thing for a poor man s wife  that s i  to be wearing a real ruby   then  her other hand went over the ring  and clasping both to her breast she  laughed gleefully   but it s mine  they ll not get it now       who wants it  foolish child   he asked  pressing her head to his  shoulder and holding the ring hand in his     she moved a little nearer to him      see some pictures for me in the fire   she commanded   see something  nice       i see a beautiful lady wearing a beautiful ring  see   right under that  top piece of coal  the ring is growing larger and larger and larger  now  it is so large you can t see the lady at all  just nothing but the ring      she laughed   now see one that isn t silly  see a beautiful one       liebchen  i see two people who are growing old  see   right down here   one of them must be sixty now  and one about seventy  but they re smiling  just as they did when they were young  and they re whispering that they  love each other a great deal better now than they did in those days of  long ago  that it has grown and grown until it is a bigger thing than the  love of youth ever dreamed of       that  is  nice   she murmured happily   that would be a nice picture to  paint   they were silent for a time  perhaps both seeing pictures of  their own   it s growing late   said ernestine  a little drowsily   but  then  i ll never have this birthday again       and it was happy   he asked tenderly   just as happy as you wanted it to  be       so happy that i hate to see it go  it was  just right       weren t any of the others happy  dear    he was stroking her hair   thinking that it too had caught little touches of the fire light      none of the others were perfect  of course  last year was our first one  together  and   a shudder ran through her      i know  dear   he hastened   i know that wasn t a perfect day       before that   she went on  after a minute of looking a long way into the  fire   something always happened  my birthday seemed ill fated  that was  why i wanted a happy one so much  to make up for all the others  this day  began right by the work going so splendidly  is there anything much more  satisfying than the feeling which comes at the close of a good day s  work  it puts you on such good terms with yourself  convinces you that  you have a perfect right to be alive  then this afternoon i read some  things which i had read long ago and didn t understand then as i do now   you see  there was a great deal i didn t know before i loved you  karl   and books are just human enough to want to be met half way       like men   he commented  meeting her then a trifle more than half way      yes  they have to be petted and fussed over  just like men  now  karl   are you listening or are you not      he assured her that he was listening      then  this afternoon  georgia came out and we went for a row on the  lagoon in jackson park  did you happen to look out and see how beautiful  it was this afternoon  karl  i wish you would do that once in a while   germs and cells and things aren t so very aesthetic  you know  and i  don t like to have you miss things  i was thinking about you as we passed  the university  it seemed such a big  wonderful place  and i love to  think of what it is your work really means  i  am  so proud of you   karl       and was it nice down there   he asked  just to bring her back to her  story of the day      so beautiful  you and i must go often now that the spring evenings have  come  there is one place where you come out from a bridge  and can see  the german building  left from the world s fair  across a great sweep of  lights and shadows  people who want to go to europe and can t  should go  down there and look at that  it s so old worldish      then georgia and i had a fine talk    after another warm  happy silence    georgia never was so nice  she was telling me all about a man  i  shouldn t wonder  but i mustn t tell even you  not yet  then i came home  and here were the beautiful flowers from dr  parkman  karl  you  did   tell him  honest now  you did  and it was awful  why didn t you put it in  the university paper so that all the students could send me things  that  nice boy  harry wyman  wrote a poem about me   to the lovely lady   now  you needn t laugh  and oh  i don t know  but it all seemed so beautiful  and right when i came home this afternoon  i love our house more and  more  i love those funny knobs on the doors  and this library seems just   us   i was so happy i couldn t keep from singing  and you know i can t  sing at all  then  you  came home  you had the box out in your hand  i  saw it clear across the street  you were smiling just like a boy  i shall  never forget how you looked as you gave me the ring  i think  after all   that look was my  real  birthday gift   now  karl  don t you  know  you  shouldn t have bought such a ring  but  oh   i   am  so happy   sweetheart      he kissed her  his heart was very full  there was nothing he could say   so he kissed her again and laid his cheek upon her hair     he knew she was growing sleepy  sleep was coming to her as it does to the  child who has had its long  happy day  but like the child  she would not  give up until the last  it was true  he was sure  that she was loath to  let the day go      the play to night was very nice   she said  rousing a little   but so  short sighted       short sighted  liebchen  how       so many things in literature stop short when the people are married  i  think that s such an immature point of view  just as if that were the end  of the story  and when they write stories about married people they  usually have them terribly unhappy about having to live together  and  wishing they could live with some one else  it seems to me they leave out  the best part       the best part  i suppose  meaning us       yes       but  dear  if you and i were written up  just as we are  we d be called  two idiots       would we    her head was caressing his coat      have you ever thought how a stenographic or phonographic report of some  of our conversations would sound       beautiful   she murmured      crazy   he insisted      perhaps the world didn t mean people to be so happy as we are    her  words stumbled drowsily      the world isn t as good to many people as it is to us  oh   sweetheart  why    he held her closely but very tenderly  for he knew she  was going to sleep   why are we so happy       because i m the  lovely  lady    it came from just outside the land of  dreams     it was sweet to have her go to sleep in his arms like this  he trembled  with the joy of holding her  looking at her face with eyes of tenderest  love  rejoicing in her  worshipping her  he went over the things she had  said  his whole being mellowed  divinely exultant  at thought of her  going to sleep just because she was tired from her day of happiness  long  ago his mother had taught him to pray  and he prayed now that he might  keep her always as she was to day  that he might guard her ever as she  had that sense now of being guarded  that her only weariness might come  as this had come  because she was so happy  how beautiful she was as she  slept  the lovely lady  that boy had said it right  after all  and she  was his   his treasure  his joy  his sweetest thing in life  he had heard  a discussion over at the university a few days before about the equality  of man and woman  how foolish that seemed in this divine moment  god in  his great far sightedness had given to the world a masculine and a  feminine soul  how insane to talk of their being alike  when the highest  happiness in life came through their being so entirely different  and she  was his  other men could send her flowers  write poems about her  loveliness  but she was his  all his  his to love and cherish and  protect  to work for  live for     he kissed her  and her eyes opened   poor little girl s so tired  but  she ll have to wake up enough to go to bed      she smiled  murmured something that sounded like  happy day   and went to  sleep again     the fire had died low  he sat there a minute longer dreaming before it   thanking god for a home  for work and love and happiness  then he picked  ernestine up in his arms as one would pick up the little child too tired  to walk to bed   oh  liebchen   he breathed in tender passion  as she  nestled close to him    ich liebe dich            chapter xii      a warning and a premonition    it put him very much out of patience to have his eyes bothering him just  when he was so anxious to work  what in the world was the matter with  them  he wondered  as he directed a couple of students on some work they  were helping him with  it seemed that yesterday afternoon he had taken a  new start  now he was eager to work things out while he felt like this   this was a very inopportune time for a cold  or whatever it was  to  settle in his eyes  perhaps the lights at the theatre last night  and  then the wind coming home  but he smiled an intimate little smile with  himself at thought of last night and forgot all about that sandy feeling  in his eyes     during the morning it almost passed away  when he thought of it at all   it was only to be thankful it was not amounting to anything  for he was  anxious to do a good day s work  he would hate it if anything were to  happen to his eyes and he had to wear glasses  he had never had the  slightest trouble with them  in fact they had served him so well that he  never gave them any thought  the idea came now of how impossible it would  be to do anything without them  his work depended entirely on seeing  things right  it was the appearance of things in their different stages  which told the story     dr  hubers had a queer little trick with his eyes  the students who  worked with him had often noticed it  he had a way of resting his finger  in the corner of his eye when thinking  sometimes it would rest in one  eye for awhile  and then if he became a little restless  moved under a  new thought  he would slip his finger meditatively over his nose to the  corner of the other eye  it did not signify anything in particular   merely an unconscious mannerism  some men pull their hair  others gnaw  their under lip  and with him it was a queer little way of rubbing his  finger in his eye     it was saturday  and that was always a good day for him as he could give  all of his time to the laboratory  he was especially anxious to have  things go well this morning  as he wanted to stop at two o clock and go  down to one of dr  parkman s operations  that end of it was very  important and this was to be an especially good operation     he was thinking about dr  parkman on the way down   of the man s splendid  surgery  it was a real joy to see him work  he did big things so very  easily and quietly  not at all as though they were overwhelming him  poor  parkman  things should have gone differently with him  if it had been  almost any other man  it would have mattered less  but it seemed a matter  of a lifetime with parkman  he could understand that better now than he  once had  to have found ernestine and then  then to have found she was   not  ernestine  but of course in the case of ernestine that could not  be  now if parkman had only found an ernestine  but then he couldn t very  well  for there was only one  since the first of time  there had been  only one  and she was his  he fell to dreaming of how she had looked last  night in the fire light  and almost forgot the station at which he was to  get off     he was in very jubilant mood when they went down to dr  parkman s office  after the operation  it had verified some of his own conclusions  seemed  fairly to stand as an endorsement of what he held  he had never felt more  sure of himself  had never seen his way more clearly  it was a great  thing to have facts bear one out  to see made real what one had believed  to be true  he went over it all with parkman  putting his case clearly   convincingly  his points standing out true and unassailable  throwing  away all the irrelevant  picking out unerringly  the little kernel of  truth   a big mind this  a mind qualified to cope with big problems  dr   parkman had never seen so clearly as he did to day how absolutely his  friend possessed those peculiar qualities the work demanded  he had never  felt more sure of karl s power  and power did not cover it  not quite      something in your eye   he asked when  just as karl was about to leave   he seemed to be bothered with his eye  and was rubbing it a little      i don t know  it s felt off and on all day as though something was the  matter with them both       want me to take a look at them       oh no  no  it s nothing       by the way  you have a bad trick with your eyes  i ve noticed it several  times lately and intended to tell you about it  you have a way of rubbing  them   not rubbing them exactly  but pressing your finger in them  i d  quit that if i were you  if you must put your finger somewhere  put it on  your nose  a man dealing with the stuff you do can t be too careful       why  what do you mean       simply what i say  one drop of some of those things you have out there  would be  a drop too much       now  look here  you don t think i m any such a bungler as that  do you       hum  you ought to know your medical history well enough to know that all  the victims haven t been bunglers  by a long sight      karl s hand was on the knob   well  don t worry about me  i m not built  for a victim  i may be run over by an automobile  anybody is liable to be  run over by yours  the way you run that thing  but i m not liable to be  killed by my own sword  that s not the way i work       just the same  you d better keep your hands out of your eyes       all right   he agreed laughingly   it does sound like a fool s trick   it s new to me   didn t know that i did it      when he was making some calls late that evening  dr  parkman passed the  university and for some reason recalled what karl had said that afternoon  about his eyes bothering him  why hadn t he examined them  or better  still  one of the best oculists in the city was right there in the  building  why hadn t he made karl go in to see him  it was criminal for a  man like that to neglect his eyes  he was near the hubers now  he had an  impulse to run over and make sure that everything was all right  he  slowed up the machine and looked at his watch  no  it was almost eleven   he would not go now  after all he was silly to be attaching any weight to  such a thing as a man s rubbing his eyes  he smiled a little as he  thought of it that way  karl wasn t bothering about it  so why should he     but he had it on his mind  thinking of it frequently until he went to  bed  and the thing which worried him most was that he was worrying a  great deal more than the facts in the case warranted  he was not given to  taking notions  and that was just what this seemed  one would suppose  that a man like hubers would be able to look out for himself    but for a  fool  give me a great man   was the thought with which the doctor went to  sleep           chapter xiii      an uncrossed bridge    karl awoke next morning with the sense of something wrong  something was  making him uncomfortable  but he was not wide enough awake at first to  locate the trouble  he lay there dozing for a few minutes and when he  roused again he knew that his eyes were hurting badly  he awakened  instantly then  his eyes  why  they had bothered him a little all day  yesterday  was there something the matter with them     he got up  raised the shade and looked in the glass  they looked badly  irritated  both of them  they felt wretchedly  he could scarcely keep  looking into the glass  then leaning over the dressing table  he looked  more closely  he thought he saw something he did not like  he took a hand  mirror and went to the window  he could see better now  and the better  light verified the other one  it was true that in the corner of one eye  there was a drop of pus  in the other there was a suggestion of the same  thing     he began to dress  proceeding slowly  his brows knitted  evidently  thinking about something  and worried  then he opened a drawer  took out  a handkerchief  got the drop of pus from his eye and arranged the  handkerchief for preserving it     he would find out about that  and the sooner the better  he did not like  it  he would see an oculist  too  this morning  it was plain he was going  to have some trouble with his eyes     ernestine noticed them at once  what made them so red   she wanted to  know  did they hurt  and wasn t there something he could put in them  he  told her he was going to look after them at once  he could not afford to  lose any time  and of course he could do nothing without his eyes     immediately after breakfast he started over to the laboratory     it was sunday morning and there would be no one there  which was so much  the better  he wanted to get this straightened out     he had his head down all the way over to the university  partly because  his eyes bothered him and partly because he was thinking hard  the  trouble had evidently been coming on yesterday  he stopped short  that  trick parkman told him about  but of course  moving on a little  that  could not have anything to do with this  he had no recollection  he was  very sure  then he walked faster  and the lines of his mouth told that he  was troubled     when he reached the laboratory he began immediately upon the microscopic  examination  he hoped he could get at it through that  for the culture  process meant a long wait  but after fifteen minutes of careful work the   smear  proved negative  there remained then only the longer route of the  culture     he did not begin upon that immediately  he sat there trying to think back  to just what it was he had been doing friday afternoon  the latter part  of the afternoon he had been sitting here by this table  that was the  time he was so buoyed up  getting so fine a light on the thing  it was  the cancer problem then  but in the nature of things nothing could have  happened with that  but there were always other things  all those things  known to the pathological laboratory     he turned around toward the culture oven  opened the outer door and  through the inner door of glass looked in at the row of tubes  he was  trying to recall what it was he had been working with the earlier part of  friday afternoon     he knew now  one of the tubes had brought it to him  yes  he knew now   and within him there was a pause  and a stillness  right over there was  where he sat preparing some cultures  there were two things with which he  had been working   again a pause  and a stillness  one of them could not  make any serious difference  he went that far firmly  and then his heart  seemed to stand quite still  waiting for his thought to go on  but he did  not go on  there was a little convulsive clutching of his consciousness   and a return  with acclaim  to the fact that  that  could not make any  serious difference  he clung there  he would not leave that  doggedly   defiantly  insistently  all embracingly he affirmed that  that  could not  make any serious difference  it was without opening his thought to  anything further that he got out his things and began preparing the  culture     he was so accustomed to this that it went very mechanically and quickly   he took one of the test tubes arranged for the process in the culture  oven and with the small wire instrument he had there  lifted the drop of  pus on the handkerchief into the bullion of the tube  he did it all very  carefully  very exactly  just as he always did  then he put the tuft of  cotton over the top and placed the tube in that strange looking box  commonly called a culture oven  in twenty four hours he would know the  truth  he adjusted the gas with a firm hand  arranging with his usual  precision this thing which outwardly was like any of his experiments and  which in reality  but he would not go into that     now for an oculist  his eyes were hurting badly  it was time to do  whatever there was to be done  after all he was rather jumping at  conclusions  there was a big chance that this was just something  characteristic to eyes and had no relation to the things of his work  he  seized upon that  ridiculing himself for having looked right over the  most simple and natural explanation of all  did not a great many people  have trouble with their eyes     that nerved him up all the way down town  he was almost ready to think it  a great joke  the way he had hurried over to the laboratory and had gone  at it in that life and death fashion     he knew that the oculist in dr  parkman s building was a good one  and so  he went there  it was a little disconcerting when he stepped into the  elevator to meet dr  parkman himself  he had not thought of trying  especially to avoid the doctor  but he had wanted to see the oculist  first and get the thing straightened out  he was counting a great deal  now on the oculist      hello   said the doctor  seeming startled at first  and then after one  sharp glance   going up to see me       well  yes  after a little  fact of the matter is i thought i d run in  and let this eye fellow take a look at me       eyes bothering you       somewhat   he said it shortly  almost curtly     when they reached the fifth floor  dr  parkman stepped out with him   although he himself belonged farther up      i know him pretty well   he explained   i ll go with you      he could not very well say   i would rather you would not   although for  some reason he felt that way     it was soon clear to their initiated minds that the oculist did not know  the exact nature of the trouble  he admitted that the case perplexed him   he  too  must make an examination of the pus  he treated karl s eyes  and  advised that they begin upon an immediate and aggressive course of  treatment  dr  parkman  observing karl s growing irritability  said that  he would look after all that  see that the right thing was done     as he walked out of that office karl was a little dizzy  his avenue of  hope had grown narrower  it was not  then  some affection characteristic  of eyes  it was  after all  something from without  it was  in all  probability  one of two things   it was either  but again he did not go  beyond the first  telling himself with nervous buoyancy that  that  would  not make any serious difference     they stepped into an elevator and went up  he knew parkman would ask him  questions now  but it seemed he could not get away from the doctor if he  tried  he felt just at present as though he had not strength to resist  any one  that oculist  he admitted to himself  had taken a good deal of  starch out of him     when they reached the office  dr  parkman offered him a drink  that  irritated him considerably      why no   he said  fretfully   no  i don t want a drink  why should i  take a drink  did you think i was all shot to pieces about something      the doctor was looking over his mail  fingering it a great deal  but not  seeming to accomplish much of anything with it  at last he wheeled around  toward him      what s the matter with your eyes   he asked with disconcerting  directness      how should i know   retorted karl  heatedly  almost angrily   what do i  know about it  if an oculist can t tell  you say he is a good one  why  should you expect me to   and then he added with a touch of eagerness  as  if seizing upon a possibility   i don t believe that fellow amounts to  much  i think i ll go out now and hunt up somebody who knows something       the man s all right   said dr  parkman shortly  his own foot was tapping  the floor nervously   you ought to have some idea   he added  with what  he felt to be brutal insistence   as to whether or not you got anything  in your eyes       well  i haven t  i don t know anything about it      but he was breathing hard  his whole manner told of fears and  possibilities he was not willing to state  he would tell what he thought  now in just a minute  the doctor knew that     he began with insisting  elaborately  that he never got things on his  hands  that was not his way  and even if he did get something on his  hands  he wouldn t get it in his eyes  even if he did rub his eyes  sometimes  he didn t admit it  but even if he did  would he be such a  fool as to rub them when he had something on his hands  but if  in spite  of all those impossibilities  just admitting for the sake of argument   and because parkman insisted on being ominous  that it was something like  that  there were two things it might be  it might be  he named the first  with emphasis  and dr  parkman  after a minute s thought  heaved a big  sigh of unmistakable relief      now you see that couldn t make any vital difference   karl added  with a  debonair manner  a thin veneer of aggressiveness     the doctor was leaning forward in his chair  he was beginning to grow  fearful of the emphasis put upon this thing which could make no vital  difference     karl stopped as though he had reached the end of his story  but the  silence was wearing on him  his eyes had a hunted look      why  you can see for yourself   he said  and this was the note of  appeal   that that could not make any vital difference      dr  parkman was looking at him narrowly  his own breath was coming hard   he saw at last that he would have to ask      the  other   he said  succeeding fairly well in gaining a tone of  indifference      heavens  how you fellows nag for details  how you drag at a man  well   the other  if you re so anxious to know   the doctor s heart sank before  the defiance of that   the other is   he looked all about him as one  hunted  desperate  and then snapped it out and turned away  and instantly  the room grew frightfully still     it struck dr  parkman like a blow from which one must have time to  recover  steeled though he was to the hearing of tragic facts  he was  helpless for the minute before this  and then  refusing to let it close  in upon him  it was he who turned recklessly assertive  defiantly  insistent      any fool would know it s not that   he said  his gruff voice touched  with bravado     there was one of those strange changes then  karl turned and faced him      how do you know   he asked  with a calm not to be thrust aside   how do  you know it s not that  you can t be sure   he pursued  and there was  fairly cunning in forcing his friend upon it  cutting off all escape    but there are just fifty chances out of a hundred that it  is  that  and  if it is   with a cold  impersonal sort of smile   would you give very  much for my chances of sight       you re talking like a fool    but beads of perspiration were on the  doctor s forehead  and then  the professional man getting himself in  hand   you re overworked  karl  you re nervous  why i can fix this up for  you  i ll just    but before that steady  understanding gaze he could not  go on      not on me  parkman     slowly and very quietly   not on me  i know the  ropes  don t try those little tricks on me  i don t need professional  coddling  and i don t need professional lies  you see i happen to know  just a little about the action of germs  we ll do the usual things  of  course  that s mere scientific decency  but if this thing has really  gotten in its work  oh i ve studied these things a little too long  old  man  i ve watched them too many times  to be able to fool myself now       well you will at least admit   said parkman  brusque because he was  afraid to let himself be anything else   that there are fifty chances  out of a hundred in your favour      karl nodded  he had leaned back in his chair  he seemed terribly tired      come now  old chap  it isn t like you to surrender before the battle   we ll prepare to meet the foe  though i give you my word of honour i  don t expect the enemy to show up  this isn t in the cards  i  know  it      karl roused a little  there was a bracing note in that vehemence   well   don t ask me to do any crossing of a bridge before i come to it  i think  our friend down stairs is thinking of hospitals and nurses and all kinds  of quirks that would drive me crazy  tell him i know what i m about  tell  him to let me alone       all right   laughed the doctor  knowing karl too well to press the  matter further just then   though  of course  common sense demands quiet  and a dark room       ernestine will darken our rooms at home   said karl stubbornly     it was strange how quickly they could turn to the refuge of everyday  phrases  could hide their innermost selves within their average selves as  the only shelter which opened to them  there was something dr  parkman  wanted to do for him  and they went into the treatment room  in there  they spoke about meeting for dinner   ernestine had asked the doctor to  come out  georgia and her mother were coming too  karl told him  and the  interview closed with some light word about not being late for dinner           chapter xiv       to the great unwhimpering       tell me some good stories about doctors   said georgia   i want to use  them in something i m going to write       isn t it dreadful   said mrs  mccormick  turning to dr  parkman   she  even interviews people while they eat   mrs  mccormick had that manner of  some mothers of seeming to be constantly disapproving  while not in the  least concealing her unqualified admiration      i m not interviewing them  mother  skillful interviewers never  interview  they just get people to talk       but what is it you re going to write   asked the doctor   a eulogy or  denunciation       both  something characteristic       meaning that something characteristic about doctors would include both  good and bad       well  they re pretty human  aren t they   laughed georgia      and think how grateful we should be   ventured karl   for the inference  of something good      dr  parkman looked over at him with a hearty   that s right   relieved  that his friend could enter into things at all     in the library before they came in  things had gone badly  mrs  mccormick  held persistently to the topic of karl s eyes  putting forth all sorts of   home remedies  which would cure them in a night  he had grown nervous  and irritable under it  and mrs  hubers several times had come to the  rescue with her graciousness  she was worried herself  the doctor could  see that in the way she looked from her husband to him  scenting  something not on the surface  he was just beginning to fear the dinner  was going to be miserable for them all  when miss mccormick broke the  tension by asking for stories      tell us what you re going to write  georgia   said ernestine  she too  seizing at it gratefully   and then our doctors will have a better idea  of what you want       well  i was talking to judge lee the other day  and he told me some good  stories about lawyers  characteristic stories  you know  so i thought i  would work up a little series  lawyers  doctors  ministers and so on   and see how nearly i could reach the characteristics of the professions  through the stories i tell of them  not much of an idea  perhaps  but i  know a man who will buy the stuff      ernestine was smiling in a knowing little way   do you want to begin with  something really characteristic   she asked      that s it  something to strike the nail on the head  first blow       then lead off with the story of pasteur s forgetting to go to his own  wedding  there s the most characteristic doctor story i know of       that s a direct insult   laughed karl      why  not at all  karl   protested mrs  mccormick   every one knows you  were on hand for  your  wedding       yes  and a good thing he was   declared ernestine   i don t think i  should have been as meek and gentle about it as the bride of pasteur  i  fancy i would have said   oh  really now  if it s so much trouble  we ll  just let it go        no  ernestine   said mrs  mccormick  seriously  after the laugh   i  don t believe you would have said that    and then they laughed again      well  it s a good story   she insisted   and characteristic  i believe  after all that pasteur was a chemist and not a doctor  but the doctors  have appropriated him  so the story will be all right       if you want to tell some stories about pasteur   said karl   tell about  his refusing the royal decoration  he told the emperor that the honour  and pleasure of doing such work as his was its own reward  and that no  decoration was needed  that story made a great hit in the scientific  world       but is it characteristic   asked georgia  slyly      well   he laughed   it ought to be       another one of the independent kind   said parkman   is on bilroth  he  was summoned to appear at a certain hour before the emperor of austria   bilroth was with a very sick patient until the eleventh hour and arrived  a little late in business clothes  the scandalised chamberlain protested   telling him he could not go in like that  whereupon bilroth blustered  out   i have no time to spare  tell his majesty if he wishes to see me   i am here  if he wants my dress suit  i will have a boy bring it  around        did he get in   asked mrs  mccormick  anxiously      i think he did  although undoubtedly miss mccormick will be too modern  to say so       there was a story i always liked about a vienna doctor   he continued   he was anxious to guide the stories  for karl had seemed suddenly to sink  within himself  he understood why  he might have foreseen where this  would lead  for there were other stories of medical men  stories which  fitted a little too closely just now  he was especially sorry he had  mentioned bilroth   this shows another side of the doctor   he went on   after a minute   and as you are going to give good as well as bad  this  may help out on the good side  there s where you will be short  a woman  came to see this doctor regarding her consumptive son  he told her there  was nothing he could do for him  adding   if you want him to live  you  must take him to italy   the woman broke down and told him she could not  do that  that she had no money  the doctor sat there thinking a moment   and then sent over to the bank and got her a letter of credit covering  the amount involved  another doctor  who happened to be near  asked why  he did that   you can t possibly support all your needy patients   he  said   why did you choose this particular case  of course   he added   it  was very good of you    no   said the doctor   it was not good of me   there was nothing good about it  but i was guilty of proposing to her  something i knew she could not do  after opening up that possibility it  was my obligation to see that she could fulfill it  i suggested what i  knew to be the impossible  after i suggested it  it was my business to  make it possible   don t you think that a pretty good sense of justice    he asked of ernestine      what might be called an inner squareness   said georgia  as ernestine  responded only with the fine lights the story had brought to her eyes     karl did not seem to have heard the story  ernestine looked toward him  anxiously      now i m going to tell a story   she said  with a gaiety thrown out for  rousing him   a very fine story   every one must listen   he looked over  at her and smiled at that  listening for her story      this man s name can t be printed  because he lives in chicago and it  might embarrass him    karl and dr  parkman exchanged glances with a  smile   this is a characteristic story  as it shows a doctor s tyranny   there was a boy taken ill at a little town near chicago  the country  doctor telephoned up to the boy s father  and the father telephoned the  family physician who  from the meagre facts  scented appendicitis  i  don t know how he knew it was bad  but i believe a good doctor is a  pretty good guesser  at any rate he suspected this was serious  and told  the father they would have to go down there at once  the father said  there was no sunday train   then get a special   said the doctor   we ll  probably have to bring him up to the hospital to operate  and can t do it  in the automobile   the father protested against the special  saying it  would be very expensive and that he did not think it necessary  the  doctor said he did think it necessary or he would not have suggested it   the father demurred still more and the doctor rang off  then you called  up the railroad office  yourself  wasn t that it   turning to dr   parkman  who grew red and looked genuinely embarrassed   oh dear    in  mock dismay   now i ve mixed it up  haven t i  well  this doctor  i m not  saying anything about who he is  called up the railroad office and calmly  ordered the special  i must not forget to say that the man who did not  want to spend the money had an abundance of money to spend  then he  called the boy s father and said   be at the station in twenty minutes   the special will be waiting  you will have nothing to do but sign the  check        well   said mrs  mccormick  when ernestine stopped as though through    would the father pay for it  and did the boy have to have an operation   and did he get well       mother doesn t like this new way of telling a story   said georgia   she  likes to hear the got married and lived happily ever after part       i m sure no one said anything about getting married in this   said mrs   mccormick  serenely      but don t you think that a fine doctor story   ernestine asked smilingly  of dr  parkman      a very bad story to tell  miss mccormick s general reader will  say     oh yes  of course  he was just bound to have an operation        georgia    this was from the man at the head of the table  and there was  something in his voice to arrest them all   if you are in earnest about  wanting stories of doctors  why don t you tell some of the big ones  some  of the stories medical men have a right to be proud of       what are they   she asked  promptly   tell me some of them      dr  parkman s eyes were on his plate  he was handling his fork a little  nervously      if i were going to tell any stories about medical men   karl went on   and in his quiet voice there was still that compelling note   it seems to  me i should want to say something about the doctors who died game  just a  little something about the men who took their medicine and said nothing   men with the nerve to face even their own understanding  cut off  you  see  from the refuge of fooling themselves  ask dr  parkman about the  surgeons who lost their hands or their lives through infection  those are  the stories he knows that are worth while  he s only giving you the  surface of it  georgia  tell him you d like a little of the real thing   ask him about the men who died slow deaths  looking a fatal future in the  face from a long way off  he mentioned bilroth just now  telling a funny  story about him  there s a better story than that to tell about bilroth   you know he was the man who knew so much about the heart  he probably  understood the heart better than any other man  and by one of those  leering tricks of fate  he had heart disease himself  he watched his own  case and made notes on it  that his profession might profit by his  destruction  there you have something worth writing about  in his last  letter home  he said he had ten days to live  and he missed it by just  one  he lived eleven  if you re going to tell any stories about bilroth   tell that one  georgia  and then a story or two showing that while many  men take chances  it s the doctor who takes them most understandingly   why medical science is full of an almost grotesque courage  don t you  begin to see how the doctor s been trifling with you  georgia      he paused  but no one felt the impulse to speak  his eyes were hidden by  the dark glasses he was wearing because of that cold  or whatever it was   in his eyes  but his face told the story of an alert mind  a heart  responsive to the things of which he spoke  then he went on and talked a  little  quietly enough  but with a passionateness  a high note of  understanding  of the men who had had the nerve  eyes open  to face the  things fate handed them  it was as if he were looking back over the whole  sweep of the world and picking from many times and many places the men  whose souls had not flinched to the death  and at the last he said   smiling  the kind of smile one meets with a tear   let s have a little  toast   he raised his glass of claret and for a minute looked at it in  silence  and then he said slowly  his very quiet voice and that little  smile tempering the words      here s to all those fellows who went down without the banners or  the trumpets   to the boys who took the starch out of their own  tragedies   to those first class sports who made no fuss about their own  funerals  here s to the great unwhimpering      dr  parkman choked a little over his wine  the tightening in ernestine s  throat made it hard for her with hers  georgia s cheeks were burning with  enthusiasm for the story she saw now she could write  and even mrs   mccormick had no questions as to just what men had died that way  then it  was karl himself who abruptly turned the conversation to the more shallow  channels of dinner talk     after that he was not unlike a man who had had a little too much  champagne  he startled them with the nimbleness of his wit  the light  play of his fancy  it was as though he had a new vocabulary  a lighter  one than was commonly his  there was a sort of delicate frolicsomeness in  his thought     for a reason unknown to her  it troubled ernestine  she looked from karl  to dr  parkman  but the doctor had that impenetrable look of his  what  was the matter with him  he had talked so freely during the early part of  the dinner  and now he seemed to have dropped out of it entirely  she  caught him looking at karl once  the keen  narrow gaze of physician to  patient  then she saw  distinctly  that his face darkened  and after  that  when he smiled at the things which were being tossed back and forth  between karl and georgia  it was what she called to herself a  made up  smile   and once or twice when karl said something especially funny  she  was quite sure she saw dr  parkman wince     a lump rose in ernestine s throat  karl seemed to have slipped away from  her  this was a mood to which she could not respond and it seemed he did  not expect her to  almost all of his talk was directed to georgia  who   with her quick wit and inherent high spirits  was enjoying the pace he  set her  it seemed to resolve itself into a duel of quick  easy play of  thought and words between those two  but the things they said did not  make ernestine laugh  she smiled  as dr  parkman did  a  made up  smile     she had always enjoyed karl s humour immensely  but now  though she had  never seen him as brilliant  something about him pulled at her heart  she  could not restrain a resentfulness at georgia for encouraging him  for  she could not get away from the feeling that all of this was not grounded  on the thing which was karl himself  it was like nothing in the world so  much as the breeziness of a mind which had let itself go  she was glad  when at last she could rise from the table     in the library it was as though he were holding on to georgia  determined  not to let her out of the mood into which he had brought her  the things  of which he talked were things having no bearing whatever upon himself   if she had not been there  had simply heard of the things said  she  would not have recognised karl at all  for the first time since they had  known one another  ernestine felt left out   alone     mrs  mccormick said that they must go  but karl protested   we re having  such a good time   he said   don t think of going      but georgia had an engagement  she insisted at last that they must go   dr  parkman had remained too  although ernestine was satisfied he was not  enjoying things      why  what in the world have you done to karl   laughed georgia  pinning  on her hat   i haven t had such good fun for months  i had no idea he was  such a gem of a dinner man       i do not think karl is very well   said ernestine  a little coolly       well   why  bless you  i never saw him in such exuberant mood       didn t they make the words fly   laughed mrs  mccormick   my dear  you  and the doctor and i were quite left behind       it seemed that way   said ernestine  trying to keep her chin from  quivering     when she returned to the library  dr  parkman and karl were evidently  just closing a discussion for karl was saying  heatedly   now just let me  manage things in my own way      the doctor seemed reluctant to leave  ernestine was alone with him for a  minute in the hall  and she was sure he started to say something once and  then changed it to something else  but when he did leave  it was with  merely the conventional goodbye     she walked slowly back to the library  karl was sitting in the morris  chair  his elbow upon one arm of it  his hand to his forehead  his whole  bearing had changed  it was as though he had let down  again it seemed as  though in the last hour he had been intoxicated  and this the depression  to follow that kind of exuberance  but he looked up as he heard her  and  smiled a little  a wan  tired smile  she was beside him in an instant      you seemed so happy this afternoon  dear   she said  stroking his hair    and now you seem so tired  aren t you well  karl   she asked  a little  timidly     his face then mirrored a dissatisfaction  a sort of resentment      i talked like a fool this afternoon   he said gruffly      why  no  dear  only  not quite like yourself       well  the fact of the matter is   this after a minute s thought   i have  a frightful headache  i suppose it comes from this trouble with my eyes   i thought i wasn t going to be able to keep up  and in my efforts to do  it  i   he paused and then laughed rather harshly   overdid it      he seemed anxious for her reply to that      i knew it was something like that   she said simply  then  after a  minute   is there anything i can do for the head      he told her no  but that he believed he would turn the chair around with  his back to the light      and i won t talk  dear   he said gently   i ll just rest a little      she helped him with the chair and for a minute sat there on a low seat  beside him      you know  sweetheart   resting her cheek upon his hand   i don t like  those dark glasses at all  i ll be so glad when you don t have to wear  them       why   he asked  his voice a little muffled      because they shut me out  i always seem closer to you when i can look  into your eyes   oh  does it pain so   as he drew sharply away      that did hurt   he admitted  his voice low   i  i d better not talk for  a little  dear      so she said if there was nothing she could do for his head  she would  leave him while she wrote a couple of letters     for a long time he sat there without moving  it was the exhaustion which  follows intoxication  for he had indeed intoxicated himself that  afternoon  and with an idea  it had come about so strangely  after they  sat down to dinner  he had been on the point a half a dozen times  of  excusing himself on the plea of a bad headache  then when they began to  talk about doctors  those other things had come to him  and it was as  though the spirit of all those men who had gone down that way entered  into him  came so close  possessed him so completely  that he could not  hold back those words about them  a spirit quite beyond his control had  moved him to that little toast  after that  something  perhaps a spark  from the nerve of those men of whom he had spoken  brought his mind  firmly into possession of the feeling that everything was all right  it  was not that he argued himself out of his fears  but rather that  something brought the assurance of its being all right  and after that  there came a number of arguments sustaining the conviction  just before  dinner he had gone over to the laboratory and looked at the culture  it  had not shown anything at all  at the time he accepted that as a matter  of course  it was not time for it to show anything  but looking back on  it after this conviction came to him  he took the very fact of its not  showing anything as proof that there was nothing there to show  his mind  only grasped one side of it  that it showed nothing at all  brightening  under that he began to talk lightly  to joke with georgia  and talking  that way seemed to enable him to keep hold of the conviction that  everything was all right  the more he talked  the more sure he was of it   the gayer he felt  the more disposed to let his mind run wild  he was a  little afraid if he stopped talking  this beautiful conviction of its  being all right would leave him  so he made georgia keep at it  georgia  was the one could play that sort of game     as he talked  new arguments came to him  the oculist  at first he had  thought it a bad thing that the oculist could not tell what was the  matter  now he seized upon that as proving there was nothing the matter  at all  and dr  parkman had said  at the last  that it did not amount to  anything  at the time that had been a mere conventional phrase  but now   in his exhilaration  he seized upon it as indisputable truth  but always  there was the feeling that he must keep on feeling this way  or the  conviction  and all that it meant  would go  that was why he clung to  georgia  finally he reached the point where he could distinctly remember  getting the other stuff  the stuff which did not make any difference  on  his hands  he could fairly see it on his hands  could remember distinctly  getting it in his eye  and then georgia had said something about going   and he had begged her not to go  but she insisted  and he began to feel  then that the exhilaration was wearing off  that he was coming back to  face things  to the doubt  the uncertainty  the suffering  and now that  he had come back to things as they were  he felt inexpressibly tired     he went over it again and again  trying to gain something now  not from  any form of excitement  but from things as they were  suddenly his face  brightened  he sat there in deep thought  and then at last he smiled a  little  whatever happened must have occurred friday afternoon  but he had  never in all his life felt as happy about his work as he did before he  left the laboratory friday afternoon  could a man feel like that  would  it be in the heart of things to let a man feel that way  if he had  already entered upon the road of his destruction  it had been more than a  happiness of the mind  it was a happiness of the soul  and would not a  man s soul send out some note of warning  and then that same evening when  he and ernestine sat before the fire  if already this grim fate had  entered into their lives  would not their love  would not  her  love  all  intuition  deep seeing  feeling that which it could not understand  have  felt in that moment of supreme happiness  some token of what was ahead   it could not be that the world jeered at men like that  their love would  have told them something was wrong     ernestine came in just then and he called her to him      liebchen   he said   i ve been thinking about that evening of your  birthday  about how beautiful it was  weren t you happy  dear  as we sat  there before the fire       so happy  karl   she murmured  warmly glad to have her own karl again    everything seemed so beautiful  everything seemed so perfectly right      he drew her to him with a passion she did not understand  his ernestine   his wife  she who communed with love  whose harmony with the great soul  of things was perfect  they could not have deceived her like that   ernestine and love dwelt too closely together  she would have received  some sign     for a time that calmed and sustained him  he believed in it  it was his  weapon to use against the doubts and terrors which preyed upon him  but  the gloom of his soul seemed to thicken with the deepening of the night   his heart grew cold with the coming of the shadows  the passing of day  inspired in him fears not to be reasoned away     he grew very nervous during the evening and finally said he must go over  to the laboratory and arrange some things for morning  ernestine  protested against it  and if he must go would he not let her go with him   but he told her he believed it would be better for his head if he walked  alone for just a little while  he did not have a headache more than once  in five years  he assured her  laughing a little  and when he did  it was  apt to upset him     when he came back at last  it seemed to her a very long time  she saw   watching from the window  that he was walking very slowly  almost as if  exhausted she could not hold back her alarm at his white  worn face   something in it gripped at her heart      is it worse  dear   she asked anxiously      it s a little bad  just now  i ll go to bed  it will be better then   he  spoke slowly  as though very tired      won t you take something for it  karl   she persisted   won t you       i do not know of anything to take that would do any good   ernestine    and he could not quite keep the quiver out of those words      but other people take things  there  are  things  let me go out and get  you something      he shook his head      doctors don t take much stock in medicine   he said  with a touch of his  usual humour     she wanted to stay with him until he went to sleep  she wanted to put  cold cloths on his head  it was hard to avoid ernestine s tenderness      it did not show anything   he assured himself  pleadingly  when alone    it only showed that it was going to show in the morning  i knew that  i  knew all the time i was going to know in the morning  i ll not go to  pieces  i ll not be a fool about it   he kept repeating     but a little later ernestine was sure she heard him groan  she could not  keep away from that      oh  sweetheart   she murmured  kneeling by his bed   i can t bear it not  to help you  let me do just some little thing   she pleaded     he put his hand over in hers   hold it  dear  if you aren t too tired  i  don t want to talk   but hold on to my hand      his grip grew very tight after a minute  she was sure his head must be  paining terribly  if only he would take something for it     in a little while he grew very quiet  soon she was sure that he was  asleep  but after she had at last stolen away he turned and buried his  face in his arms           chapter xv      the verdict    it was monday morning now  the hours of that night had been hours of  torture  sleep had come once or twice  but sleep meant only the surrender  of his mind to the horrors which preyed upon it  he could  in some  measure  exert a mastery when awake  but no man is master of his dreams   his dreams put before him all those things his thoughts fought away  in  his dreams  there was a fearful thing pursuing him  reaching out for him   gaining upon him with each step  or sometimes  it stalked beside him  not  retreating  not advancing  but waiting  standing there beside him with  grim  inexorable smile  it was after waking from such dreams that he  breathed his prayer that this night pass  no matter what be ahead  he  asked that this night pass away     after he was up he found himself able to go on in much the usual way   when ernestine came in and asked about his head  he told her it was  better  when she wanted to know about his eyes  he said they were not any  better yet  but that that was something which would simply have to run  its course  she begged him not to go over to the university  but he told  her it was especially important to go this morning  he added that he  might not be there very long     he ate his usual breakfast  a truth that would shake the foundations of  his life might be waiting for him just ahead  and yet he could make his  usual laughing plea for a second cup of coffee  undoubtedly it was so  with many men  beneath a mail of conventions and pleasantries they lived  through their fears and sorrows alone     something clutched at his heart as he kissed ernestine good bye and there  was a momentary temptation  could he face it alone  if he had to face it   to have her with him  but he put that aside  not alone for her sake  but  because he felt that after all there were things through which one must  pass alone  but after he had reached the door  he came back and kissed  her again  what if he were to go down into a place too deep for his voice  to reach her     there was some solace  assurance  in the naturalness of things about him   everything else was just the same  it did not seem that it could be part  of natural law then for his own life to be entirely overturned     and the world was so beautiful  it was a buoyant spring morning  there  was assurance in the song of the birds  in the perfume of flowers and  trees  the air upon his face was soft and reassuring  this seemed far  away from the hideous phantoms of the night  why the world did not  feel   like tragedy this morning     he had a lecture at eight o clock  and he made up his mind he would give  it  in the night he had thought of going first of all to the laboratory   the truth would be waiting for him there  but it was his business to give  the lecture and he could not be sure of giving it if he went to the  laboratory first  a man had no right to let his own affairs interfere  with his work  oh yes  by all means  he would give the lecture  in spite  of his prayer that the uncertainty should end  he reached out for another  hour of holding it off     he knew as the hour advanced that he had never done better work in the  lecture room  he pinned his mind to it with a rigidity which prompted him  to put the subject as though it were the most vital thing in all the  world  he threw the whole force of his will to filling his mind with the  things of which he spoke that he might not yield so much as an inch to  the things which waited just outside     he talked until the last minute  in fact  he went so much over his time  that another class was waiting at the door  he clung to those last  moments with the desperation of the drowning man to the splintered piece  of board  after it was over  just as he was yielding the desk to the man  who followed him  one of his students approached him with a question and  the thankfulness  the appeal  almost  in the smile with which he received  him  mystified the student until he stammered out his question  bewilderedly     he could wait no longer now  that room belonged to others  the next  period was his usual hour in the laboratory  it was an hour which on  monday morning he could  if he wished  spend alone     his temples were beating  thundering  his hands were so cold that they  seemed things apart from him  but his mouth  how parched it was   was set  very hard  and his steps  though slow  was firm     in the outer laboratory  professor hastings stopped him  remonstrating  against his working when he was having trouble with his eyes  he assured  him  elaborately  that he was taking care of them  that probably he would  not be in there long     he opened the door of his laboratory and passed in  he closed it behind  him  and stood there leaning against it  he was all alone now  there was  nothing in the room but himself and the truth which was waiting for him     he put his book down upon the table  he walked over and sat down before  the culture oven  he must get this over with  he was getting sick  he  could not stand much more     with firm  quick hand he wrenched open the doors  he put his hand upon  what he knew to be the tube  he pulled it out  turned around to the light  and held it up between him and the window  for one moment he looked  away   how parched his mouth was  and then  a mighty will turning his  eyes upon it  in one long gaze he read the plain  unmistakable   unalterable truth  he had never seen a better culture  science would  perhaps commit itself no further than to say his eyes had become  inoculated with the most virulent germ known to pathology  but out beyond  the efforts which would be made to save him  he read  written large  the  truth     he was going blind           chapter xvi       good luck  beason      minutes passed and nothing happened  there was no sound of splintering  glass  the tube did not fall from his hands  not so much as gasp or groan  broke the stillness of the laboratory  he did not seem to have moved even  the muscle of a finger     he faced it  he understood it  he faced it and understood it as he had no  other truth in all his life  no merciful  mitigating force caused his  mind to totter  with fairly cosmic regularity  cosmic inevitability   comprehension struck blow after blow     he was going blind  he had spent his life studying the action of such  forces as this   he knew them   a man who knew less would have hoped  more  some idle dreamer might attempt to push one star closer to another   an astronomer would not do that     he was going blind  he could no more do his work without his eyes than  the daylight could come without the sun  fate jeered at him   your eyes  are gone  but your life will remain   it was like saying to the sun   you  are not to give any more light  but you are to go on shining just the  same      he was going blind  the world which had just opened to him  the world of  sunsets and forests and mountains and seas gulped to black nothingness     blind  swept under by a trick he would not have believed possible from  his most careless student  mastered by the things he had believed he  controlled  meeting his life s destruction from the things which were to  bring his life s triumph  in that moment of understanding s throwing wide  her gates to torture  fate stood out as the master dramatist  making him  do it himself  working it out of a mere fool s trick     blind    blind   but his eyes fitted his brain so perfectly it was  through them all knowledge came to him  they were the world s great  channel to his mind  it was through his eyes he knew his fellow beings   the lifting of an eyebrow  a queer twist to a smile  those things always  told him more than words  and  but here he staggered  the mind could get  this  as it had all else  but on this the heart broke   ernestine    that  smile  the love lights in her eyes  the glints of her dear  dear  hair  the tube fell from his hand  his head sank to the table  he was  buried now under an agony beyond all power to lift     whether it was minutes or hours which passed then  he never knew in the  days which followed  time is not measured by common reckoning on the hill  of calvary     the thing which brought him from under the blow at last was a blinding  rage  he wanted to take a revolver and blow his brains out  then and  there  he  a man supposed to have a mind   he   counted a master of those  very things  and now  what  manhood  power   himself  gone  stumbling  through his days  useless   a curse to himself and everyone else  groping  about in the dark  a thing to be pitied and treated well for pity s sake   cared for  looked after   helped   that beat down the bounds of control   he did things then which he never remembered and would not have believed     it all rushed upon him  the birthday night  the crafty  insidious mockery  through every bit of it  until everything to which he had held tottered  about him  and goaded beyond all power to bear there came a slow   comprehending  soul deep curse on the world and all that the world had  done  and then  out of the darkness  through the blackened  dizzying   tottering mass  a voice  a face  a smile  a touch  a kiss  and the curses  gave way to a sob and things steadied a little  no  not the world and  everything it had done  for it was a world which held ernestine  a world  which had given ernestine to him for his     he fought for it then  for his faith in the world  his belief in the  things of love  it was the fight of his life  the fight for his own soul   come what might in the future  it was this hour which held the decisive  battle  for if he could not master those things which were surging upon  him  then the things which made him himself were gone for all time  and  when sense of the underlying cunning of the blow brought the surrendering  laugh close to his parched lips it was held back  held under  by that  ever recurring memory of a touch  a voice  a face  it was ernestine   their love  fighting against the powers of damnation for the rescue of  his soul     even in the battle s heat  he had full grasp of the battle s  significance  knew that all the future hung upon making it right this  hour with his own soul  his face grew grey and old  he concentrated days  of force into minutes  but little by little  through a strength greater  than that strength with which men conquer worlds  a force greater than  the force with which the mind s big battles are won  by a force not given  many since the first of time  he held away  beat back  the black tides  ready to carry him over into that sea of bitterness from which lost souls  send out their curses and their jeers and their unmeetable silences     he tried to see a way  he tried to reach out to something which should  help him  standing there amid the wreck of his life  he tried to think   even while the ruins were still falling about him  of some plan of  reconstruction  it was like rebuilding a great city destroyed by fire   the brave heart begins before the smoke has cleared away  but that task  is a simple one  the city destroyed by fire may be rebuilded as before   but with him the master builder was gone  out of those poor  scarred   ungeneraled forces which remained  could he hope to bring anything to  which the world would care to give place     he could see no way yet  all was chaos  and just then there came a knock  at the door     he paid no heed at first  what right had the world to come knocking at  his door  what could he do for any one now     the knock was repeated  but he would not go  if it were some student   what could he do for him  he could only say   i can do nothing for you   go to some one else   and should it be one of his fellow professors  come  to counsel with him  he could only say to him   i have dropped out  go on  without me  i wish you good luck      that message he had thought to give   and now      again the knock  timidly this time  fearing a too great persistency  but  reluctant to go away  he would go in just a minute now  there would not  come another knock  well  let him go  when all the powers of fate had  gathered round to mock and jeer was it too much to ask that there be no  other spectators  was not a man entitled to one hour alone among the  ruins of his life     he who would gain entrance was starting  very slowly  to walk away  he  listened to him take a few steps  and then suddenly rose and hurried to  the door  he was not used to turning away his students unanswered     it was beason who turned eagerly around at sound of the opening door   beason  of all people  that boy who never in the world would understand     he was accustomed to reading faces quickly and even through his dark  glasses his worried eyes read that beason was in trouble  moved by  something from the path in which he was wont to go      i m sorry to interrupt you   stammered the boy  as he motioned him to a  chair      oh  that s all right  i wasn t doing anything  very important   just  finishing up something   he added  glad  when he heard his own  voice  that it was only beason      i m in trouble   blurted out beason   and i  i wanted to see you      the man was sitting close to a table  and he rested his elbow upon it   and shaded his eyes with his hand      trouble   his voice was kind  though a little unsteady   why  what s the  trouble       i ve got to stop school  i ve got to give up my work for a whole year      the hand still shaded his darkened eyes  his mouth was twitching a  little      a year  beason   he said  any one else would have been struck with the  note in it   you say  a year       yes   said beason   a whole year  my father has had some hard luck and  can t keep me here  i d try to get work in chicago  and stay on  but i  not only have to make my own way  but i must help my mother and sister   next year another deal my father s in will probably straighten things  out  and then i suppose i can come back      the man very slowly nodded his head   i see   he said  his voice coming  from  way off somewhere   i see       it s tough   exclaimed beason bitterly   pretty tough      dr  hubers had turned his chair away from beason  and with closed eyes  was facing the light from without  there was a long pause  beason waited  patiently  supposing the man to be thinking what to say about so great a  difficulty      as i understand it   he said  turning around at last   it s like this   you are to give up your work at the university for a year  just one short  little year  and do something else  something not so much in your line   perhaps  but something which will be helping those you care for  making  it easier for some one else  it s to be your privilege  as i understand  it  to fill a man s place  that s about it  isn t it       but that s not the point  i thought    in an injured  almost tearful  voice   that you would understand       oh  i do  i see the other point  you hate to stop work for    he cleared  his throat   for a year       a year   said beason dismally   is such a long time to lose      the man had nothing to say to that  his head sank a little  he seemed to  be thinking     finally he came out of his reverie  seemed to come from a long way off    and where are you going  my boy   he asked kindly   what are you going  to do       i m going clear out west   said beason gloomily   father has something  for me with a company in the northwest       out there    an eager voice rang out  a voice which rested on a  smothered sob   great heavens  man  you re going out there  out there to  the mountains and the forests  out there where you can see the sun come  up and go down  can see  can see    but his voice trailed off to a  strange silence      i never cared much for scenery   said beason bluntly   and i care a lot  for  all this i m leaving       we don t really leave a thing   said the man  his voice was low and  tired   when we re coming back to it  the only real leave takings are the  final ones      beason shifted in his chair  some of these things were not just what he  had expected      beason    something in his voice now made the boy move a little  nearer   i m sorry for your disappointment  but i wish i could make you  see how much you have to live for  get in the habit of looking at the  sunsets  beason  take a good many long looks at the mountains and the  rivers  it s not unscientific  you know    with a little whimsical toss  of his head   we only have so many looks to take in this world  and when  we re about through we d hate to think they d all been into microscopes  and culture ovens  and don t worry too much  beason  about things running  into your plans and knocking them over  you know what that wise old omar  had to say about it all   he paused  and then quoted  very slowly  each  word seeming to stand for many things         and fear not lest existence closing your    account  and mine  shall know the like no more     the eternal saki from that bowl has pour d    millions of bubbles like us  and will pour        and  will  pour    he repeated the three words  and then his head  drooped  his hands fell laxly at his sides  it seemed it was not of  beason he had been thinking as he looked fate in the face with that taunt  of the old persian poet     but he looked at him after a moment  came back to him  he saw that the  boy was disappointed  the gloom with which he had come had not lifted  from his face  that would not do  he was not going to fail his student  like that      why  look here  beason   he said in a new tone  all enthusiasm now    maybe you ll shoot a bear  i have a presentiment  beason  that you will   and when you re eighty five and have your great grandchild on your knee   you ll think a great deal more about that bear than you will about the  year you missed here at school  now brace up  hard knocks wake a fellow  up  you ll come back here and do better work for your year of roughing  it  take my word for it  you will      beason had brightened   and you think    he grew a little red   that when  i come back i can have my old place here with you      the man drew in his breath  drew it in rather hard  something had taken  the enthusiasm away      i ll do my little part  beason   he said  exceedingly quietly   to see  that you are not overlooked when you come back      the boy rose to go   i do feel better   he said clumsily  but with  heartiness     he looked around the room   i hate to leave it  i ve had some good times  here  and i m  fond of it   the man was leaning against the wall  he did  not say anything at all     then beason held out his hand   good bye   he said   and  thank you      for a minute there was no reply  nothing save the very cold hand given in  response to beason s  but that was only for the instant  and then the man  in him  those things which made him more than a great scientist  things  more than mind  not even to be comprehended under soul  those fundamental  things which made him a man  rose up and conquered  he straightened up   smiled a little  and then heartily  quite sunnily  came the words   take  a brace  beason  take a good brace  and good luck to you  boy  good  luck      the door had closed  at last he was alone again  dizzy with the strain he  staggered to a chair  for a long time he sat there  many emotions  struggling in his face  he could not see it yet  not quite  it was all  very new  and uncertain  but  way out there in the darkness it seemed  there was perhaps something waiting for him to grasp  he would never give  that other message  but it might be  if he worked hard enough  and never  faltered  he could learn to say to the world which had given him this   say heartily  quite sunnily   good luck to you  good luck            chapter xvii      distant strains of triumph    it worried ernestine when she saw dr  parkman s motor car stopping before  the house early tuesday morning  he had been there the afternoon before   and then again late in the evening  bringing another doctor with him  he  said that they simply came to help keep karl amused  but surely he would  not be coming again this morning if there were not something more serious  than she knew  karl had come home from the university about noon the day  before  saying that his head was bad and he was going to consider himself   all in  for the day  something about him had frightened her  but he  insisted that it only showed what a headache could do to a fellow who was  not accustomed to it  he had remained in his darkened room all day  not  even turning his face from the wall when she came in to do things for  him  that worried her  and even the doctor s assurance that he was not  going to be ill had not sufficed  in fact  she thought dr  parkman  was acting strangely himself      i was out in this part of town and thought i d drop in   he told her  as  she opened the door for him      you re not worried about karl   she demanded     he was hanging up his cap   you see  i don t want him to get up and go  over to the university   he said  after a minute s pause  in which she  thought he had not heard her question   that wouldn t be good for his  eyes       well  doctor  what is it about his eyes  is it just  something that must  run its course       oh  yes   he answered  and she was a little hurt by the short way he  said it  was it not the most natural thing in the world she should want  to know  really  doctors might be a little more satisfactory  she  thought  as she told him he would find karl in his room     she herself went into the library  down in the next block she saw the  postman  and thought she would wait for him  she felt all unnerved this  morning  things were happening which she did not understand  and then  she felt so  left out of things   she wanted to do things for karl  she  would love to hover over him while he was not well  but he seemed to  prefer being let alone  and as for dr  parkman  there was no sense in his  adopting so short and professional a manner with her     but as she stood there by the window  the bright morning sunlight fell  upon her ruby  and she smiled  she loved her ring so  it was so dear of  karl to get it for her  the warm  deep lights in it seemed to symbolise  their love  and it would always be associated with that first night she  had worn it  that beautiful hour when they sat together before the fire   that had been its baptism in love     the postman was at the door now  and she hurried to meet him  she was  much interested in the mail these days  for surely she would hear any  time now regarding her picture in paris     it had come  the topmost letter had a foreign stamp  and she recognised  the writing of laplace     heart beating very fast  she started up to her studio  she wanted to be  up there  all by herself  when she read this letter  as she passed karl s  door she heard dr  parkman telling about having punctured a tire on his  machine the night before  of course then everything really was all right   or he would not have talked about trivial things like that     her fingers fumbled so that she could scarcely open the envelope  and  then she tried to laugh herself out of that  prepare for disappointment   why  what in the world did she expect     as she read the letter her face went very white  her fingers trembled  more and more  then she had to go back and read it sentence by sentence   it was too much to take in all at once     it was not so much that it had been awarded a medal  not so much that a  great london collector  laplace said he was the most discriminating  collector he knew  wanted to buy it  the overwhelming thing was that the  critics of paris treated it as something entitled to their very best  consideration  the medal and the sale might have come by chance  but  something about these clippings he had enclosed seemed to stand for  achievement  they said that  the hidden waterfall   by a young american  artist  was one of the most live and individual things of the exhibition   they mentioned things in her work which were poor  but not one of them  passed her over lightly     she grew very quiet as she sat there thinking about it  the  consciousness of it surged through and through her  but she sat quite  motionless  it seemed too big a thing for mere rejoicing  for what it  meant was that the years had not played her false  it meant the  justification  exaltation  of something her inmost self     and it meant that the future was hers to take  she leaned forward as if  looking into the coming years  eyes shining with aspiration  cheeks  flushed with triumph  she quivered with desire  the desire to express  what she knew was within her     it was while lost to her joy and her dreaming that she heard a step upon  the stairs  she started up  instantly broken from the magic of the  moment  perhaps karl needed her  and then before she reached the door she  knew that it was karl himself  how very strange      oh  karl    not able to contain it a minute   i want to tell you    and  then  startled as he stumbled a little  and going down a few steps to  meet him   but isn t there too much light up here  shouldn t you stay  down in the dark       i don t want to stay down in the dark    he said it with a low intensity  which startled her  and then she laughed      i ve always heard there was nothing so perverse as a sick man  i ll tell  you what s the matter with you  you re lonesome  you re tired of getting  along without me  now aren t you  but we ll go down to the library  and  down there i ll tell you  oh   what  i ll tell you  i thought dr  parkman  was going to stay with you a while    as he did not speak   or i  shouldn t have come away      he had seated himself  and was rubbing his head  as though it pained him   his eyes were hidden  but his face  in this bright light  made her want  to cry  it told so plainly of his suffering  he reached out his hand for  hers   i didn t want him any longer  liebchen    he said it much like a  little child   i want  you       of course you do    tenderly   and i m the one for you to have  but not  up here  the light is too bright up here      she pulled at his hand as if to induce him to rise  but he made no  movement to do so  and he did not seem to have heard what she said    ernestine   he said  in a low voice  there was something not just  natural in karl s voice  a tiredness  a something gone from it   will you  do something for me      she sat down on the arm of his chair  her arm about him with her warm  impulsiveness   why karl  dear   a light kiss upon his hair   you know i  would do anything in the world for you       i want you to show me your pictures    he said it abruptly  shortly   i  want to look at them this morning   all of them       but  but karl   she gasped  rising in her astonishment   not  now        yes  now  you promised  you said you d do anything in the world for me       but not something that will hurt you       it won t hurt me    still abruptly  shortly      but i know better than that  why any one knows that eyes in bad  condition mustn t be used  and looking at pictures  up here in this  bright light  so needless  so crazy    she laughed  though she was  puzzled and worried     he was silent  and something in his bearing went to her heart  his head   his shoulders  his whole being seemed bowed  it was so far from karl s  real self   any other time  dear   she said  very gently   you know i  would love to do it  but some time when you are better able to look at  them       i m just as able to look at them now as i will ever be   he said   slowly   ernestine  please       but karl    her voice quivering   i just can t bear to do a thing that  will do you harm       it won t do me harm  i give you my word of honour it won t make any  serious difference       but dr  parkman said        i give you my word of honour   he repeated  a little sharply      all right  then   she relented  reluctantly  and darkened the room a  little      dear    sitting on a stool beside him   you re perfectly sure this  trouble with your eyes isn t any more serious than you think       yes   he answered  firmly enough  but something in his voice sounded  queer   i m perfectly sure of that       show me your pictures  ernestine   laying his hand upon her hair   i ve  taken a particular notion that i want to see them       but first   carried back to it   i want to tell you something   she  laughed  excitedly   i was coming down to tell you as soon as the doctor  left  oh karl  my picture in paris  i heard from it this morning  and its  success has been  tremendous   she laughed happily over the word and did  not think why it was karl s hand gripped her shoulder in that quick   tight way   shall i read you all about it  dear  and then will you  promise to cheer right up      still that tight grip upon her shoulder  it hurt a little  but she did  not mind  it just showed how much karl cared  the hand was still there  as she read the letter  and then the clippings which told of the  rare quality of her work  predicted the great things she was sure to  do   sometimes it tightened a little  and sometimes it relaxed  and once   with a quick movement he stooped down and turned her ring around  turning  the stone to the inside of her hand     when she had finished he was quite still for a long minute  he was  breathing hard   karl was excited about it too  and then he stooped over  and kissed her forehead  and it startled her to feel that his lips were  very cold      liebchen   he said  his voice trembling a bit  karl did care so  much    i am glad   for a minute he was very still again  and then he  added  seeming to mean a different thing by it   i am very glad       it s gone to my head a little  karl  oh i m perfectly willing to admit  it has  i don t think i should appreciate the gloria victis very much  myself this morning   she laughed  happily     she was too absorbed to notice the quick little drawing in of his breath   or his silence   after all  it would be a sorry thing if i didn t  succeed   she pursued  gayly   for you stand so for success that we  couldn t be so close together  could we  dear  if i were a dismal  failure       you think not   he asked  and she wondered if he had taken a little  cold  his voice sounded that way      oh i don t mean that too literally  but i like the idea of our going  through the same experiences  both succeeding  it seems to me i can  understand you better this morning than i ever did before  i read a  little poem last night  and at the time i liked it so much  it is about  success  or rather about not succeeding  but i m afraid it wouldn t  appeal to me very much just now    again she laughed  happily  and it was  well for the happiness that she was not looking at him then      what was it   he asked  as he saw she was going to turn around to him    say it       part of it was like this          not one of all the purple host   who took the flag to day   can tell the definition   so clear  of victory      as he  defeated  dying    on whose forbidden ear   the distant strains of triumph   break agonized and clear         say that last verse again   he said  his voice thick and low   karl was  so different when he was sick         as he  defeated  dying    on whose forbidden ear   the distant strains of triumph   break agonized and clear         it is beautiful  isn t it   she said  as he did not speak      beautiful  i don t know  i suppose it is  i was thinking that quite  likely it is true       but i didn t suppose you would care about it  karl  i supposed you would  feel about it as you did about the statue       i wonder   he began  slowly  not seeming sure of what he wanted to  say   how much the comprehension  the understanding of things  that the  loss would bring  would make up for the success taken away  i wonder just  what the defeated fellow could work out of that       but dearie   is  it true  why can failure comprehend success any more  than success can comprehend failure       it s different   he said  shortly      how do you know   she asked banteringly   what do you know about it  you  don t even know how to spell the word failure      he started to say something  but stopped  and then he stooped over and  rested his head for a minute upon her hair   tell me about your picture   ernestine   he said  quietly  after that   tell me just what it is       the hidden waterfall  why you know it  karl       yes  but i want to hear you talk about it  i want to hear you tell just  what it means       well  you remember it is a child standing in a beautiful part of the  woods  it is spring time  as it seems best it should be when you are  painting a child in the woods  i tried to make the picture breathe  spring  and you know one of the writers said that the delicious thing  about it was the way you got the smell of the woods   that pleased me   behind the child  visible in the picture  but invisible to the child  is  a waterfall  the most vital thing in the universe to me was to have that  waterfall make a sound  i think it does  or the picture wouldn t mean  anything at all  and then of course the heart of the picture is in the  child s face  the puzzled surprise  the glad wonder  and then deeper than  that the response to something which cannot be understood  it might  have been called  wondering   or even  mystery   but i liked the simpler  title better  and i like that idea of painting  not just nature  but  what nature means to man  i want to get at the response  the thing  awakened  the things given back  don t you see how that translates the  spirit there is between nature and man  stands for the oneness      he nodded  seeming to be thinking   i see   he said at last   i wonder if  you know all that means       why  yes  i think i do  my next picture will get at it in a  um  a more  mature way       tell me about it       i don t know that i can  very well  it s hard to put pictures into  words  i fear it will sound very conventional as i tell it  but of course  it is what one puts into it that makes for individuality  it is in the  woods  too  you know  karl  how i love the woods  and i  know  them  it  is not spring now  but middle summer  no suggestion of fall  but mature  summer  a girl  just about such a girl as i was before you came that day  and changed everything  had gone into the woods with a couple of books   she had been sitting under a tree  reading  but in the picture she is  standing up very straight  leaning against the tree  the books overturned  and forgotten at her feet  drawn into the bigger book  see  it is not  that she has consciously yielded herself  it is not that she is  consciously doing anything  she is listening  oh how she listens and  longs  for what  none of us know  she least of all  perhaps to the far  off call of life and love speaking through the tender spirit of the  woods  oh how i love that girl   and believe in her  and hope for her  in  her eyes are the dreams of centuries  and don t you see that it is the  same idea  the oneness  the openness of nature to the soul open to it       and you are going to make the woods very beautiful   he asked  after a  little thought   more than just the beauty of trees and grass and  colour       yes  the beauty that calls to one      then   he said this a little timidly   might it not be striking to  have your girl  not really seeing it with the eyes at all  have her  eyes  closed  perhaps  but she feeling it  knowing it  in the higher  sense really seeing it  just the same      she thought about that a minute   n  o  karl  i think not  it seems to me  she must be open to it in every way to make it stand for life  in the  sense i want it to       perhaps   he said  his voice drooping a little  and then  abruptly    have you done any of that       oh  just some little sketches       show me the little sketches   he begged   i want to see them all       oh  but karl  they wouldn t convey the idea at all  wait until it is  farther along       no  please show them this morning    softly  persuasively     she was puzzled  and reluctant  but she got them out  and with them other  things to show him  he asked many questions  in the sketches she was  going to develop he would know just how she was going to elaborate them   he asked her to tell just how they would look when worked out   i m a  sick boy home from school   he said   and i must be amused   and then he  looked at her finished pictures  she protested against the intentness  with which he looked at some of them  insisting they were not worth the  strain she could see it was on his eyes   it s queer about finished  pictures   she laughed   they re not half so great and satisfying as the  pictures you are going to do next   it went through her with a sharp pain  to see karl hurting his eyes as she knew he was hurting them  she could  not understand his insistence  it was not like him to be so unreasonable   and he looked so terribly  so worn and ill  if only he would go to bed  and let her take care of him  but he seemed intent on knowing all there  was to know about the pictures  a strange whim for him to cling to this  way  as he looked he wanted her to talk about them  tell just what this  and that meant  insisting upon getting the full significance of it all     he had never before appreciated her firm grasp  her work in these  different stages of evolution gave him a clearer idea of how much she had  worked and studied  how seriously and intelligently she had set out for  the mastery of her craft  he had always known that the poetic impulses  were there  the desire to express  the ideas  the delight in colour  but  he saw now the other things  this was letting him into the workman s side  of her work     he spoke of that  and she laughed   yes  this is what they don t see   this is what they never know  poetic impulses don t paint pictures  karl   that s the incentive  the thing that keeps one at it  but you can t do it  without these tricks of the trade which mean just downright work  i ve  never worked on a picture yet in which i wasn t almost fatally  handicapped by this thing of not knowing enough  the bigger your idea   the more skill  cunning  fairly  you must have to force it into life      she told him at last that they were through  they had even looked at rude  little sketches she had made of places they had cared for in europe   indeed he looked very long at some of those little sketches of places  they had loved      one thing more   he said   you told me once you had some water colour  daubs you did when a little girl  let me look at them  i just want to  see   he laughed   how they compare      and so she got them out  and they looked them over  laughing at them    you ve gone a long way   he said  pushing them aside  as if suddenly  tired     he leaned back in his chair  his hand above his eyes  as she began  gathering up the things   and so here i am   she said  waving her hand to  include the things about her   surrounded by the things i ve done  not a  vast array  and some of it not amounting to much  but it s i  dear  it  reflects me all through these years       i know   he said   that s just it    and at the way he said it she  looked up quickly   you re tired  karl  it s been too much  we ll go down  stairs now  and rest      he watched her as she gathered the things together  it seemed he had  never really known this ernestine before  here was indeed the atmosphere  of work  the joy of working  all the earnestness and enthusiasm of the  real worker  and then  with masterful effort  he roused himself  he had  not yet touched what he had come to know      i have been thinking   he began   a little about the psychology of all  this  you ll think i m developing a wonderful interest in art  but you  see i m laid up and can t do my own work  so i m entitled to some  thoughts about art  now these things you paint grow out of a mental  image  don t they  dear  the things you paint the mind sees first  so  that the mental image is the true one  and then you  approximate  i  should think then that it might help you to  tell  about pictures  for  instance  if in painting a picture you had to tell about it to some one  who did not look at it  wouldn t that make your own mental image more  clear  and so help make it more real to you       why  karl  i never thought of it  but    meditatively   yes  i believe  it would      he turned away that she might not see the gladness in his face   and it  would be interesting  wouldn t it  to see just how good a conception you  could give of the picture through words       yes   she said  interested now   it would be a way of feeling one s own  grip on it       of course   he continued   that couldn t be done except in a case  like  yours and mine  where people were close together       yes   she assented   and that in itself would show that they were close  together      at that he laid a quick hand upon her hair  caressing it      oh  after all  dear    gathering up the last of the sketches   the  greatest thing in the world is to do one s work  isn t it       yes   he said  and his voice was low and tired   unless the greatest  thing in the world is to submit to the inevitable      she looked up quickly   that doesn t sound like you       doesn t it  oh  well    with a little laugh   you know a scientist is  supposed to be capable of a good deal of change in the point of view      he had risen  and was at the door   it s been good of you to do all this   ernestine       why it has been a delight to me  dear  if only it hasn t hurt you  but  it is time now to go down where it is dark       yes   he assented wearily   it is time now to go down where it is dark            chapter xviii      telling ernestine    he had thought to tell her on tuesday  but after their talk  when he took  his last look at her pictures  it had tortured both eyes and heart to do  that  but he knew in the days ahead that he would be unsatisfied with  having passed it by  he could not bring himself then to do it  he could  not keep it from her long now  but she was so happy that day in her  triumph about the picture  he was going to darken all of her days to  come  he would leave her this one more unclouded  but it was hard for him  to go through with it  he longed for her so  he must have her help  he  had asked for the pictures before telling her just because he knew it  would be unbearable for them both  if she did know  it would need to be  done in that casual way or not at all  it was strange how he felt he must  see them  it was his longing to keep close to her  he could not bear the  thought that his blindness might make him to her as something apart from  life  even though the dearest thing of all  he must enter into every  channel of her life     it was wednesday now  and he had told her  all the night before he had  lain awake trying to think of words which would hurt her the least  he  would put it very tenderly to his poor ernestine  he would even pretend  he saw some way ahead  something to do  ernestine could not bear it  unless he did that  it was the one thing which remained for him now  to  make it easy for her     this was firmly fixed in his mind when he told her that morning he wanted  to talk to her about something and asked her to come into the library  he  was sure he had himself well in hand  the words were upon his lips   and then when he said   i want to tell you something  dear  something  that will hurt you very much  i never wanted to hurt you  i can not help  it now    when he had said that  and she  with quick response to the  sorrow in his voice  had knelt beside him  her arms about his neck   something   the feel of her arms  the knowing there was some one now to  help him  swept away the words and his broken hearted cry had been   oh   sweetheart  help me  i m going blind      those first moments took from her something of youth and gladness she  would never regain  first frozen with horror  then clinging to him  wildly  sobbing that it could not be so  that dr  parkman  some one   would do something about it  protesting in a fierce outburst of the love  which rose within her that it did not matter  that she would make it all  up to him  their love make it right  in one moment stricken dumb as  comprehension of it grew upon her  in another wildly defying fate  but  always clinging to him  holding him so close  trying  though frightened  and broken  to stand between him and the awful thing as the mother would  stand between the child and its destroyer  ernestine left with that  hour things never to be claimed again  and when at last she began to  sob  sobbing as he had never heard any one sob before  all his heart was  roused for her  and he patted her head  kissed her hair  whispering    little one  little one  don t  we ll bear it together  some way      during that hour she never loosened her arms about his neck  deep in his  despairing heart there glowed one warm spark  ernestine would cling to  him as she had never done before  god had not gone out of the world then   he had let fate strike a fearful blow  but he had left to the wounded  heart such love as this      dear   she said at last  her cheek against his  her dear  quivering  voice trying so hard to be brave   if you feel like telling me  everything  i would like to know  i will be quiet  i will be good  but i  want to bear every bit of it with you  every bit of it  darling  now  and  always  that is all i ask  that you let me bear it with you      the love  the understanding  the longing to help  which were in her voice  opened that innermost chamber of his heart to her  if she had not won  this victory now  she could never have done so in the days ahead  this  hour made possible the other hours of pouring out his heart to her   taking her into it all  he told her the story of how it happened  the  long  hard story which only covered days  but seemed to extend through  years  he told of those hours of the day and night on the rack of  uncertainty  of trying with the force of mind and soul to banish that  thing which had not claimed him then  but stood there beside him  not  retreating   waiting  he told her of that lecture hour monday morning  when he literally divided himself into two parts  one part of him giving  the lecture  giving it just as well as he had ever done  the other part  battling with the phantom which he would vanquish or surrender to within  an hour  and her only cry was   you should have told me  you should have  told me from the first   and once he answered   no  dear  no  before i  knew i did not want to frighten you  and after  oh  ernestine  believe  me  sweetheart  i would have shielded you forever  no matter at what cost  to myself  if only i could have done it      at last he had finished the story  he had told it all  of sitting there  afraid to look  of looking and seeing and comprehending  oh how he had  comprehended  it was as if his mind too  his mind trained to grasp  things  had turned against him  was stabbing him with its relentless  clearness of vision  he told her of the merciless comprehension with  which he saw the giving up of his work  the changing of his life  the  giving up  the eternal giving up  he told her of how it had seemed to  mean the making over of his soul  for his soul had always cried for  conquest  for victory  for doing things  how would he turn it now to  submission  to surrender  to relinquishment  everything had been tumbling  about him  he said  when that knock came at the door as the call from  life  the intrusion of those everyday things which would not let him  alone  even in an hour like that  and then of the boy with his paltry  trouble which seemed great  the hurts  the final rising up of the  instinct to help  despite it all  then of sitting there alone and seeing  a faint light in the distance  wondering if  in all new and different  ways  he could not keep his place in the world      oh help me to do that  sweetheart  help me to keep right  don t let me  lose out with those other things of life      her arms about his neck  he would never forget how she clung to him   there was a long silence when their souls reached one another as they  had never done before  the quivering of her body  her breath upon his  cheek  they told him all  but after that  the words did come to her   broken words struggling to tell of what her love would do to make it  right  how she would be with him  so close  so unfailing  that the  darkness would never find him alone     his arms about her tightened  thank god  oh yes  a million times thank  god for ernestine     then he felt her start  there came a sound as though she would say  something  but choked it back      yes  dear   he said gently      oh  karl  i shouldn t ask it  it will hurt you  i shouldn t ask       i would rather you did  dear  ask anything  we are holding nothing from  one another now       i just happened to think  i wanted to know  oh karl  it wasn t in your  eye on my birthday  was it  it hadn t happened  wasn t happening  when we  sat there by the fire  happier than we had ever been before      his impulse was to hold that back  why should he put that upon her  too   to hurt her as it had him  shake her faith as it had tried to shake his     but his moment of silence could not be redeemed   karl    her voice was  strangely quiet   it wasn t  was it      he groaned  and she had her answer     she sprang away from him  standing straight   then   she cried  he would  never have dreamed ernestine s voice could have sounded like that   i  hate the world  i despise it  i will not have anything to do with it  it  fooled us  cheated us   made fun of us   i ll despise it  fight it   the  words became incoherent  the sobs grew very wild  she sank to the floor   crouching there  her hands clenched  sobbing   i hate it  oh how i want  to pay it back      he was long in quieting her  but at last she would listen to him      ernestine   he said  his voice almost stern   if you start out like that  you cannot help me  it is to you i look  if you love me  ernestine  help  me not to hate the world  if we hate the world  we have given up   sweetheart    the voice changed on that word   even yet  even yet in a  different way  i want to win  i cannot do it alone  i cannot do it at  all  if you hate the world  you are to be my eyes  ernestine  you are to  see the beautiful things for me  you are to make me love them more than i  ever did before  you are to be the light  don t you see  sweetheart  and  you cannot do it  don t you see you cannot  if your own heart is not  right with the world      she did not answer  but she came back to his arms  her quick breath told  him how hard she was trying       see your statue up there  liebchen  remember how you always liked it   what you said about it that night  oh  ernestine   crushing her to  him   help me to grip tight to my broken sword            chapter xix      into the dark    she was with him as he went then into the dark  she did not fail him in  anything  the hand in his  the little strokes of genius in holding his  mind  and when they went into the deeps where words were not fitted for  utterance she did not fail him in those other things  he knew that as she  clung to him with loving arms  so her spirit reached out to him in the  demand that it be permitted to sustain     through the day and through the night she was with him now  there was no  time when he could not reach out to find her  no bad dream from which he  could not awaken to put his hand upon her and know that she was there   and when  time after time  bitterness rose up to submerge his soul  he  could always finally shake it off by thanking god for ernestine     for a time the pain in his eyes served as a kindly antidote  the light  was going out with so intense a suffering as to mitigate the suffering in  the consciousness of its going  it was the pain in his temples helped him  hold off the pain of giving up his work  it was not a thing conquered  he  knew that the deeper pain was waiting for him out there in the darkness  when the pain of transition should have ceased  leaving only a blank  a  darkness  no other thing to engage for him any part of his mind  there  was blessedness in the temporary alleviation brought by the pain that was  physical  there were many things for him to meet out there  they were  willing to wait  now his fighting powers were so well engaged as to take  something from the reality of a future battlefield     in many ways it was not as he would have imagined it had he known of such  a thing  he would have thought of it as one long mood of despair   inflamed at times by the passion of rebellion  there were  in truth  many  moods  in hours when he was quiet they spoke of the things they had seen  and loved  of italy and the alps they spoke often  struggling for the  words to paint a picture  sometimes she read a little to him  there would  be much of that now  through it all  they seized upon anything which  would sustain each other  once when he saw her faltering he told her  that he thought after awhile he would write a book  he did not call it a  text book  did not speak of it as the kind of work to which a man  sometimes turns when his creative work is done  he had always thought  that when he was sixty or seventy he might write a few books  he would  write them now at forty     and when there came times of its being utterly unbearable  they were  either silent or trivial     bitter questionings filled ernestine s heart in those days  how was she  going to watch him suffer and not hate a universe permitting his  sufferings  how care for a world of beauty he could not see  how watch  his heart break for the work taken from him and keep her belief in an  order of things under which that was enacted  how love a world that had  turned upon him like that  that was what he asked her to do  it seemed to  her  now  impossible     with him  as the bearing of the physical pain grew mechanical and the  other things grew nearer  the worst of it was wondering what he should do  with the days that were ahead  his spirit would not go with his sight   his desire to do was not to be crushed with his ability for doing  what  then of the empty days to come  how smother the passion for his work  and  if he did smother it  what remained  while he lived  how deafen himself  to the call of life  through what channel could he hope to work out the  things that were in him  and how remain himself if constantly denying to  himself the things which were his  it was that tormented him more than  the relinquishing of the specific thing he had believed would crown the  work of his life  his fight now would be a fight for clinging to that in  him which was fundamental  but with what weapon should he fight     many times he failed to bear it in conformity with his ideal of bearing  it  there were hours of not bearing it at all  hours of cursing his fate  and damning the world  then it was her touch upon his hand  her tear upon  his cheek  her broken word which could bring him again into the sphere of  what he desired to be  his desire to help her in bearing it  his  thankfulness in having her   those the factors in his control     there were two weeks of that  weeks in which two frightened  baffled  souls fought for strength to accept and power to readjust  their  failures  the doubts  the rage  they sought to keep from each other   their hard won victories  their fought for courage they gave to the  uttermost  a failure of one was a failure for one  but a victory of one  was a victory for two  it was through that method courage succeeded in  some measure in holding its own against bitter abandonment to despair     his last looks were at her face  it was that he would take with him into  the darkness  as a man setting sail for a far country seeks to the last  the face upon the shore  so his last seeing gaze rested yearningly upon  the dear face that was to pass forever from his vision  and when the end  had come  when hungering eyes turned to the face they could not see  and  he knew with the certainty of encountered reality that he would never  again see the love lights in her eyes  that others would respond to the  smile that was gone from him forever  others read in her face the things  from which he was shut out  when he knew he would never again watch the  laughter creep into her eyes and the firelight play upon her hair  it  came upon him as immeasurably beyond all power to endure  and in that  hour he broke down and in the refuge of her arms gave way to the utter  anguish of his heart  and she  all of her soul roused in the passion to  comfort him  whispered hotly  the fierce tenderness of the defending  mother in her voice      you shall not suffer  you shall not  i will make it up to you  i will  make it right            part two          chapter xx      marriage and paper bags    it was evident that peace did not sit enthroned in georgia s soul  her  movements were not calm and self contained as one by one she removed the  paper bags from her typewriter   so  silly     she sputtered to herself   what were the men in this office  anyway  college freshmen  hanging paper  bags all over her things every time she stepped out of the office  and  just because one of her friends happened to be in the paper bag business   she d like to know  as she pounded out her opening sentence with  vindictiveness  if it wasn t just as good a business as newspaper  reporting     it was not a good day for teasing georgia  she did not like the story she  had been working on that morning   go out to the university   the city  editor had said   and get a good first day of school story  make the  feature of it the reorganisation of dr  hubers  department  and use some  human interest stuff about his old laboratory  the more of that the  better      she hated it  were they never going to let karl alone  was it decent to  put his own cousin on the story  georgia s chin quivered as she wrote  that part about karl s laboratory   if my own mother were killed in the  street   she told herself  trying to blink back the tears   i suppose  they d make  me  handle it because i know more about her than any one  else in the office      resentment grew with the turning of each sentence  they knew that karl  was her cousin  and almost as close to her as her own brother  she was  sure they had seen the tear stains on some of that maudlin copy she had  handed in about him  when she turned in her story she was unable to  contain herself longer      mr  lewis   she said  voice quivering   here is another one of those  outrageous stories about my cousin  dr  hubers  when you ask me to write  the next one  you may consider it an invitation for my resignation   and  then  cheeks very red  she went back to her desk and began getting up  some stuff for her column  just dogs   which they had been running on the  editorial page     when the city editor was passing her desk about half an hour later he  stopped and asked  very respectfully and meekly  georgia was far too  good to lose   miss mccormick  will you see dr  parkman some time before  to morrow  and ask him about this hospital story  you know  miss  mccormick  you re the only reporter in town he ll see       very well   said georgia  with dignity     all summer long the papers had been printing stories about karl  it made  her loathe newspaper work every time she thought about it  to think of  their hacking at him like that  and he so quiet and dignified and brave   a picture printed the sunday before  of karl fumbling his way around  had  made her more furious than she had ever been in all her life     she turned just in time to see a grinning reporter writing on the  bulletin board   miss g  mccormick  human interest story about the inner  life of a paper bag      sometimes it might have brought a smile  usually it would have fired her  to the desired rage  but to day it contributed to her tearfulness   oh  they needn t worry   she murmured  bending her head over a drawer  and  tossing things about furiously   there s no getting married for me  this  office has settled that      the city editor seemed to take special delight in sending her out on  every story which would  give married life a black eye   when the father  left the little children destitute  when the mother ran away with the  other man  or the jealous wife shot the other woman  georgia was always  right on the spot because they said she was so clever at that sort of  thing   oh it makes one just  crazy  to get married   she had said   witheringly  to joe one night     why did he want to marry her  anyway  when she  told  him she didn t want  to  wasn t that enough  was it respectful to treat her refusal as though  it were a subtle kind of joke  various nice boys had wanted at various  times to marry her  and she had always explained to them that it was  impossible  and sent them  more or less cheerfully  on their various  ways  but this man who made paper bags  this jolly  good natured   seemingly easy going fellow  who held that the most important thing in  the world was for her  georgia  to have a good time  only seemed much  amused at the idea of her not having time to marry him  and when she told  him  with just as much conviction as she had ever told any of the others   that he had better begin looking around for some one else  he would  reply   all right  sure   and would straightway ask where she wished to  go for dinner that night or whether she preferred an automobile ride to a  spin in his new motor boat  now what was one to do with a man like that   a man who laughed at refusals and mellowed with each passing snub      telephone  miss mccormick    the boy sang out from the booth  the  opening  hello  was very short  but the voice changed oddly on the  oh   ernestine   her whole face softened  it was another georgia now   why  certainly  i ll get them for you  you know i love to do things for you  down town  but my dear  what in the world do you want with flower seeds  this time of year     oh  i see  planted in the fall  but the flowers  that bloom in the spring  tra la      they chatted for a little while and after georgia had hung up the  receiver she sat there looking straight into the phone  her face as  dreamy as georgia s freckled face well could be   by jinks    she was  saying to herself   it  can  be like that   it was a most opportune time  for the paper bag man to telephone  he wondered why her voice was so  soft  and why there was not the usual plea about being too busy when he  asked her to meet him at the little japanese place for a cup of tea   and  it s positively heroic of joe to drink that tea   she smiled to herself   as she wrestled with her shirt waist sleeves and her jacket     but out on the street she grew stern with herself   now don t go and do  any fool thing   she admonished   don t jump at conclusions  you aren t  ernestine  and he isn t karl  he s joseph tank  of all abominable names   and he makes paper bags  of all ridiculous things  tank s paper bags    she guessed  not   suppose in some rash moment she did marry him  people  would say   what business is your husband in   and she would choke down  her rage and reply   why  why he makes paper bags      he was sitting there waiting for her  smiling  he was awfully good about  waiting for her  and about smiling  it was nice to sit down in this cool   restful place and be looked after  he had a book which she had spoken  about the week before  and he had a little pin  a dear little thing with  a dog s head on it which he had seen in a window and thought should  belong to her  and he was on track of the finest collie in the united  states  after all  he thought it would be better for her to have a collie  than a bulldog  she was losing ground  she was being very nice to him   and she had firmly intended telling him once for all that she could never  marry a man whose name was tank  and who contributed to the atrocities of  fate by making paper bags  and then she had a beautiful thought  perhaps  he would be willing to go away somewhere and live it down  he might go to  boston and go into the book publishing business  surely publishing books  in boston would go a long way toward removing the stigma of having made  paper bags in chicago  and meanwhile  sighing contentedly  and fastening  on her new pin  as long as she was here she might as well forget about  things and enjoy herself           chapter xxi      factory made optimism    the usual congested conditions existed in dr  parkman s waiting room when  georgia arrived a little after five  an attendant who knew her  and who  had great respect for any girl dr  parkman would see on non professional  business  took her into the inner of inners  where  comfortably  installed  sat professor hastings      glad to have you join me   he said   i feel like an imposter  getting in  ahead of these people       oh  i m used to side doors   laughed georgia     they chatted about how it had begun to rain  how easy it was for it to  rain in chicago  and in a few minutes the doctor came in     he nodded to them  almost staggered to a chair  sank into it  and leaning  back  said nothing at all      why  doctor   gasped georgia  after a minute   can t you  take   something  why you re simply all in      he roused up then   i am  a  little fagged  fearful day       well  for heaven s sake get up and take off that wet coat   here    rising to help him   i ve always heard that doctors had  absolutely no sense  sitting around in a wet coat       i wonder   he said  after another minute of resting   why any man ever  takes it into his head he wants to be a doctor       and all day long   she laughed   i ve been wondering why any girl ever  takes it into her head she wants to be a newspaper reporter       speaking of the pleasant features of my business   she went on   i may  as well spring this first as last  here am i  a more or less sensible  young woman  come to ask you  a man whose time is worth  well  let s say  a thousand dollars a second  what you intend doing about those hospital  interns getting drunk last night       my dear miss georgia    brushing out his hand in a characteristic way  which seemed to be sweeping things aside   go back to your paper and say  that for all i care every intern in chicago may get drunk every night in  the week        bully  story       and furthermore  every paper in chicago may go to the devil  and every  hospital may go trailing along for company  oh lord  i m tired      he looked it  it seemed to georgia she had never understood what  tiredness meant before      such a hard day   professor hastings asked      oh  just one of the days when everything goes wrong  rotten  business  anyway  eternally patching things up  i d like to be a  well  a  bridge builder for awhile  and see how it felt to get good stuff to start  with       and now  to round out your day pleasantly   laughed professor hastings    i ve come to tell you about a boy out there at the university who is in  very bad need of patching up       what about him   and it was interesting to see that some of the  tiredness seemed to fall from him as he straightened up to listen     georgia rose to go  but he told her to stay  he might feel more in the  mood for drunken interns by and by     he arranged with professor hastings about the student  and it was when  the older man was about to leave that he asked  a little hesitatingly   about dr  hubers   i have been away all summer   he told the doctor   and  have not seen him yet      georgia was watching dr  parkman  his face just then told many things      you will find him  quite natural   he answered  in a constrained voice      one hardly sees how that can be possible   said the professor sadly      oh  his pleasantness and naturalness will not deceive you much  your  eyes can take in a few things  and then his voice  gives him away a  little  but he won t have anything to say about  the change      he shook his head   i m afraid that s so much the worse       perhaps  but        karl never was one to get much satisfaction out of telling his  troubles   georgia finished for him      hastings   said the doctor  jerkily  and he seemed almost like one  speaking against his will   what do you make out of it  don t you think  it  pretty wasteful       yes  wasteful   he went on  in response to the inquiring look   i mean  just that  there are a lot of people   he spoke passionately now   who  seem to think there is some sort of great design in the world  what in  heaven s name would they say about this  do you see anything high and  fine and harmonious about it      that last with a sneer  and he stopped with an ugly laugh   they make me  tired  those people who have so much to say about the world being so  right and lovely  they might travel with me on my rounds for a day or  two  one day would finish a good deal of this factory made optimism       does dr  hubers feel  as you do   hastings asked  not quite concealing  the anxiety in the question      how in god s name could he feel any other way   though it s hard making  him out    turning to georgia  who nodded understandingly   just when  he s ready to let himself go he ll pull himself together and say it s so  nice to have plenty of time for reading  that ernestine has been reading  a lot of great things to him this summer  and he believes now he is  really going to begin to get an education  but does  that  make you feel  any better about it  god   i was out there the other day  and when i saw  the grey hairs in his head  the lines this summer has put in his face   when i saw he was digging his finger nails down into his hands to keep  himself together while he talked to me about turning his cancer work over  to some other man  i tell you it went just a little beyond my power to  endure  and i turned in then and there and expressed my opinion of a god  who would permit such things to happen  and then what did he do  got a  little white around the lips for a minute  looked for just a second as  though he were going to turn in with me  and then he smiled a little and  said in a quiet  rather humorous way that made me feel about ten years  old   oh  leave god out of it  parkman  i don t think he had much of a  hand in this piece of work  if you must damn something  damn my own  carelessness        he said that  he can see it like that    there was no mistaking the  approval in professor hastings  eager voice      huh    the doctor was feeling too deeply to be conscious of the rudeness  in the scoff   so you figure it out like that  do you  and you get  some satisfaction out of that way of looking at it  the scheme of things  is very fine  but he must pay the penalty of his own oversight   weakness  carelessness  whatever you choose to call it  well  i don t  think i care much about a system that fixes its penalties in that  particular way  when i see men every day who violate every natural law  and don t pay any heavier penalty than an inconvenience  when i see  useless pieces of flesh and bone slapping nature in the face and not  getting more than a mild little slap in return  and then when i see the  biggest  most useful man i have ever known paying as a penalty his life s  work  oh lord  that s rot  i have some hymn singing ancestors myself  and  they left me a tendency to want to believe in something or other  so i  had fine notions about the economy of nature  poetry of science  but this  makes rather a joke of that  too  don t you think   he paused  and  georgia could see the hot beating in his temples and his throat  and then  he added  with a quiet more unanswerable than the passion had been   so  the beautiful thing about having no gods at all is that you re so fixed  you have no gods to lose      the telephone rang then  and there was a sharp fire of questions ending  with   yes  i ll see her before nine to night   he hung up the receiver  and sat there a minute in deep thought  seeming to concentrate his whole  being upon this patient now commanding him  and then he turned to  hastings with something about the boy out at the university  telling him  at the last not to worry about the financial end of it  that he liked to  do things for students who amounted to something     professor hastings was smiling a little as he walked down the corridor   he wondered why dr  parkman cared anything about slaving for so senseless  and unsatisfying a world     he loved the doctor for his inconsistencies           chapter xxii      a blind man s twilight     ready       all ready       then  one  two  three  we re off   a laugh and a scamper and one grand  rush down to the back fence   you go too fast   she laughed  gasping for  breath      and you re not steady  you jerk       but this was a fine straight row  i can steer it just right when you  don t push too hard  now  back      they always had a great deal of fun cutting the grass  ernestine used to  wish the grass had to be cut every day     but karl did not seem to be enjoying it as much as usual to day   i m  going to desert you   he said  after a little while      lazy man       yes  lazy good for nothing man  leaves all the work for his wife      she looked at him sharply  his voice sounded very tired   i ll be in in  just a few minutes  dear   she said     she did not go with him  she knew karl liked to find his own way just as  much as he could  she understood far too well to do any unnecessary   helping      but she stood there and looked after him  watched him with deep pain in  her eyes  he stooped a little  and of course he walked slowly  and  uncertainly  all that happy spring and assurance had gone from his walk     she walked down to the rear of the yard  stood there leaning against the  back fence  she had dropped more than one tear over that back fence     she too had lost something during the summer  struggle had sapped up some  of the wine of youth  her face was thinner  but that was not the vital  difference  the real change lay in the determination with which she had  learned to set her jaw  the defiance with which she held her head  and  the wistfulness  the pleading  with which her eyes seemed to be looking  out into the future  the combination of things about her was a strange  one     she looked to the west  the sun was low  the clouds very beautiful  for  the minute she seemed to relax   beauty always rested her  and then  with  a sharp closing of her eyes  a bitter little shake of her head  she  turned away  she could not look at beautiful things now without the  consciousness that karl could not see them     they always sat together in the library that hour before dinner   our  hour  they had come to call it  she wondered  with a hot rush of tears   if they did not care for it because it marked the close of another day   she turned to the house  kicking the newly cut grass with her foot   walking slowly  she was waiting for something  fighting for it  karl  needed her to night  needed courage and cheer     she came so quietly  or else he was so deep in thought  that he did not  hear her  for a minute she stood there in the library door     he was sitting in his morris chair  his hands upon the arms of it  his  head leaning back  his eyes were closed  one could not tell in that  moment that he was blind  but it was more than the dimness  the blankness  in his eyes  more than scarred eyeballs  made for the change in karl s  face  he and life did not dwell together as they had once  a freedom and  a gladness and a sureness had gone  the loss of those things meant  the loss of something fundamentally karl  and the sadness  and the  longing  and the marks of struggle which the light of courage could not  hide     she choked a little  and he heard her  and held out his hand  with a  smile  it was the smile which came closest to bridging the change  he was  very close to being karl when he smiled at her like that     she sat down on the low seat beside him  as was their fashion   lazy  man    brushing his hand tenderly with her lips   wouldn t help his wife  cut the grass      she wondered  as they sat there in silence  how many lovers had loved  that hour  it seemed mellowed with the dreams it had held from the first  of time  ever since the world was very young  children of love had crept  into the twilight hour and claimed it as their own  perhaps the lovers of  to day love it because unto it has been committed the soul of all love s  yesterdays     she and karl had loved it from the very first  in those days when they  were upon the sea  those supreme days of uncomprehended happiness  they  sat in the twilight then and watched day withdraw and night spread itself  over the waters  they loved the mystery of it  for it was one with the  mystery of their love  they loved it for reasons to be told only in great  silences  knowing unreasoningly  that they were most close together then     and after that they came to love the twilight for the things it  bequeathed them   don t you remember   he would say   we left it just as  the sun was setting  aren t you glad we can remember it so   it was as if  their love could take unto itself most readily that which came to it in  the mystic hour of closing day     and when they returned  during that first year of joy in their work  they  loved the hour of transition as an hour of rest  their day s work was  done  in the evening they would study or read or in some way occupy  themselves  but because they had worked all through the day they could  rest for a short time in the twilight  and they would tell of what they  had done  of what they hoped to do  if there had been discouragements  they would tell of them  and with the telling they would draw away  in  the light of closing day the future s picture was unblurred  they loved  their hour then as true workers love it  it was good to sink with the day  to the half lights of rest and peace     now it was all different  but they clung to their love for it still   through the heart of the day  during those hours which from his early  boyhood had been to him working hours  this removal from life brought to  the man a poignancy of realisation which beat with undiminishing force  against the wall of his endurance  it was when he finished his breakfast  and the day s work would naturally begin that it came home to him the  hardest  they would go into the library  and ernestine would read to  him  how she delved into the whole storehouse of literature for things to  hold him best  and how great her joy when she found something to make the  day pass a little less hard than was the day s wont  he would listen to  her  loving her voice  and trying to bring his mind to what she read  but  all the while his thoughts reaching out to what he would be doing if his  life as worker were not blotted out  the call of his work tormented him  all through the day  and the twilight was the time most bearable because  it was an hour which had never been filled with the things of his work   in that short hour he sometimes  in slight measure found  if not peace   cessation from struggle   this is what i would be doing now   he told  himself  and with that  when the day had not drawn too heavily upon him   he could rest a little  perhaps  in some rare moments  almost forget     but to night the spell of the hour was passing him by  ernestine saw that  in the restless way his hand moved away from hers  the nervous little  cough  the fretted shaking of the head  she understood why it was  the  fall quarter at the university opened that day  it would have marked the  beginning of his new year s work  very quietly she wiped the tears from  her cheek  she tried never to let karl know that they were there     his head had fallen to his hand  and she moved closer to him and laid her  face against the sleeve of his coat  she did not say anything  she did  not touch him  or wind her arm  as she loved to do  about his neck  she  had come to understand so well  and perhaps the greatest triumph of her  love was in knowing when to say nothing at all     at last he raised his head  his voice  like his face  was tensely drawn    ernestine  don t bother to stay  probably you want to be seeing about  dinner  and i  i don t feel like talking      that too she understood  she only laid her hand for the moment upon his  hair  then   call me  dear  if you want me   and she slipped away  and in  a little nook under the stairs sat looking out into their strange future  with wondering  beseeching eyes  seeking passionately better resources  a  more sustaining strength     left alone the man sat very still  his hands holding tight the arm of the  chair  the tide of despair was coming in  was washing over the sands of  resignation  beating against the rocks of courage  many times before it  had come in  but there was something overwhelming in its volume to night   it beat hard against the rocks  was it within its power to loosen and  carry them away  carry them out with itself to be gone for all time     he rose and felt his way to the window  he pressed his hot forehead  against the pane  outside was the dying light of day  but the glare of  noonday  the quiet light of evening  the black of the night  were all one  to him now  was it going to be so with his mind  his spirit  would all  that other light  light of the mind and soul  be gulped into this black  monotone  this nothingness     he had heard of the beautiful spirit of the blind  of the mastery of fate  achieved  the things they were able  in spite of it all  to gain from  life  ernestine had read him some of that  he had been glad to hear it   but it had not moved him much  most of those people had been blind for a  long time  he too  in the course of ten or twenty years  when the best of  his life was gone  would become accustomed to groping his way about   reading from those books  and having other people tell him how things  looked  but so long as he remained himself at all how accustom himself to  doing without his work  in the records and stories of the blind  it  seemed if they had a work it was something which they could continue  but  with him  the work which made his life was gone     over there was the university  it had been a busy day at the  university  old faces and new faces  all the exuberance of a new start   the enthusiasm for a clean slate  students anxious to make some  particular class  how well he knew it all  who was in his laboratory  who  working with his old things  to whom was coming the joy he had thought  would be his  what man of all the world s men would achieve the things he  had believed would crown his own life     some day ernestine would read it to him  he had made her promise to do  that  if it came  he would see it all  just how it had been worked out   and the momentary joy of the revelation would sweep him back into it and  he would forget how completely it was a thing apart from him  and then  ernestine would ask him if he wanted his chair a little higher or lower   or whether she should shut the window  and he would pick up one of his  embossed books and try to read something  and he would know  as he had  never known before  how the great world which did things was going right  on without him     there were a few little petitions he sent out every once in a while   i  want to remain a man  i want to keep my nerve  i don t want to whine  i  don t want to get sorry for myself  for god s sake help me to be a good  fellow  a half way decent sort of chap      and he had not tried in vain  his success  as to exteriors  had been  good  mrs  mccormick said it was indeed surprising how well one could get  along without one s sight     but within himself he had not gone far  ernestine knew something of  that  though he had tried his best with ernestine  and parkman knew  for  parkman had a way of knowing everything     and yet they did not know it all  the waking up in the night and knowing  it would not be any more light in the morning  hearing the clock strike  four or five  and thinking that in a little while he would be getting up  and going to work  only to remember he would never be going to work in  that old way again  the waking in the morning feeling like his old self   strength within him  his mind beseeching him to start in  no man had ever  suffered with the craving for strong drink as he suffered for the work  taken from him     he had  by what grit he could summon  gone along for five months  but  ahead were five years  ten years  thirty years  perhaps  and what of  them  each day was a struggle  the living of each day a triumph  through  thousands of days should it be the same     it was the future which took hold of him then  smothered him  he went  down before the vision of those unlived days  the grim vision of those  relentless  inevitable days  standing there waiting to be lived  it was  desolation  the surrender of a strong man who had tried to the uttermost     whether it was because he upset a chair  whether she heard him groan  or  whether she just knew in that way of hers that it was time for her to be  there  he did not know  but he felt her at the door  and held out  beseeching arms     he crushed her to him very close  he wanted to bring her more close than  she had ever come before  for he needed her as he had not needed her  until this hour   ernestine  ernestine    the sob in his voice was not to  be denied   what am i going to do       karl    after her moment of passionate silence   tell me this  doesn t  it get any better  one bit easier       no    that would have no denying  and then   oh but i m the brute to  talk to you like this  after you ve been   again he swept her into his  arms   what you have been to me this summer      she guided him to a chair and knelt beside him  she held his hand for a  minute as the mother holds the hand of the child in pain  and then she  began  her voice tender  but quietly determined   karl dear  let s be  honest  let s not do so much pretending with each other  for just this  once let s look it right in the face  i want to understand  oh how i want  to  what s the very worst of it  dear  is it  the work       yes    the word leaped out as though let loose from a long bondage    ernestine  no one but a man can quite see that  what  is  a man without  a man s work  what is there for him to do but sit around in namby pamby  fashion and be fussed over and coddled and cheered up  lord   he threw  away her hands and turned his face from her   i d rather be dead      her utter silence recalled him to a sense of how she must be hurt  could  he have looked into her eyes just then he would never have ceased to  regret those words     there was contrition in his face as he turned back  he reached out for  her hands  those faithful  loving hands he had thrust away  for just a  minute she did not give them  but that was only for the minute  so quick  was she to forgive  so eager to understand      forget that  sweetheart  quick  i didn t know what i was saying  why   liebchen  it s only you makes it bearable at all  if i did not have you i  should  choose the other way       karl    in an instant clinging to him wildly   you hadn t thought  you  couldn t think        oh  sweetheart  you ve misunderstood  now  dearie  don t  don t make me  feel i ve made you cry  all i meant  ernestine  was that without you it  would be so utterly unbearable      he stroked her hair until she was quiet   why  liebchen  do you think  anything under heaven could be so bad that i should want to leave you       i should hope i had not failed  quite that completely   she whispered  brokenly      failed    you   come up here a little closer and i ll try to tell you  just how far you ve come from having failed      at first he could tell her best in the passionate kiss  the gentle  stroking of her face  the tenderness with which his hands rested upon her  eyes  and then words added a little   everything  liebchen  everything of  joy and comfort and beauty and light  light  sweetheart  everything of  light and hope and consolation that comes to me now is through you   you ve done more than i would have believed in human power  you have  actually made me forget  and can you fancy how supreme a thing it is to  make a man forget that he is blind  you ve put the beautiful things  before me in their most beautiful way  do you suppose that alone  or with  any one else  i could see any beauty in anything  you ve made me laugh   how did you ever do that  you wonderful little ernestine  and   sweetheart  you ve helped me with my self respect  you ve saved me in a  thousand little ways from the humiliations of being blind  why you  actually must have some idea of what it is like yourself       i have  karl  i have imagined and thought about it and tried to  well   just trained myself  until i believe i do know something of what it is  like       you love me   he murmured  carried with that from despair to exultation      but if you could only know how  much        i do know  i do know  dear  i wish that all the world  i d hate to have  them know  for it s just ours  but for the sake of faltering faith they  ought to know what you ve been to me this summer       then  karl    this after one of their precious silences   i want to ask  you something  it is hard to say it just right  but i ll try  you know  that i love you  that we have one of those supreme loves which come at  rare times  perhaps for the sake of what you call faltering faith  but   karl  this will sound hard  but after all  doesn t it fail  fail of being  supreme  doesn t it fail if it is not  satisfying  i don t mean that it  should make up to one for such a thing as being blind  but if in spite of  love like ours life seems unbearable to you without your work  why then   dear  doesn t it fail      he was long in answering  and then he only said  slowly   i see  i see  how you have reasoned it out  i wonder if i can make you understand       ernestine    the old enthusiasm had kindled in his face with the  summoning of the thoughts   no painter or sculptor ever loved his work  more than i loved mine  and i had that same kind of joy in it  that  delight in it as a beautiful thing to achieve  that may seem strange to  you  but the working out of something i was able to do brought me the  same delight the working out of a picture brings to you  dear  it was my  very soul  and so  instead of there being two forces in my life after i  had you  it was just the one big thing  you made me bigger and because i  was bigger i wanted to do bigger things  don t you see that      she held his hand a little more closely in response  he knew that she  understood      don t think i have given up  why of course i haven t  i will adjust  myself in a little time  do what there is for me to do  i am going to see  immediately about a secretary  a stenographer  no  ernestine  i don t  want you to do that  it s merely routine work  and i want you to do your  own work  one of us must do the work it was intended we should  i could  have gone on with some lecture work at the university  but i  this year i  couldn t quite do that  i ll be more used to handling myself by next  year  have myself better in hand in every way  i couldn t quite stand the  smell from the laboratory just now  this year i shall work on those  books i ve told you about  just class room books  i never could write  anything that would be literature  i m not built for that  but these  things will be useful  i ve felt the need of something of the sort in my  own classes  i ll always make a living  ernestine  don t you ever worry  about that  and the world won t know  why should we let it know we re not  satisfied  but i can t hide from you that it is the other  the creative  work  the  oh  i tell you  ernestine  the fellows up there in the far  north don t have all the fun  it may be great to push one s way through  icebergs  but i know something that is greater than that  they say there  is a joy in standing where no man ever stood before  and i can see that   for i too have stood where no man ever stood before  but i m ahead of  them  mine s the greater joy  for i knew that my territory was worth  something  that the world would follow where i had led    the old force   fire  joyous enthusiasm had bounded into his voice  but it died away  and  it was with a settling to sadness he said   you see  little girl  if  there was a wonderful picture you had conceived  your masterpiece   something you had reason to feel would stand as one of the world s great  pictures  if you had begun on it  were in the heat of it  and then had to  give it up  it would not quite satisfy you  would it  dear  to settle  down and write some textbooks on art       karl  it s i who have been blind  i tried so hard to understand  but  i  oh  karl  can t we do something  can t we  do  something about it       i was selfish to tell you  but it is good to have you understand      but she had not let go that idea of something being done   karl    couldn t  you go on with it  isn t there some way  can t we  find  a  way      he shook his head   i have thought of it by the hour  gone over every  side of it  but work like that takes a man s whole being  it takes more  than mere eyes and hands  more than just mind  you must have the spirit  right for it  all things must work together  it s not the sort of work to  do under a handicap  god knows i d start in if i could see my way  but  neither the world nor myself would have anything to gain  some one would  have to be eyes for me  and so much more than eyes  it s all in how  things look  dear  their appearance tells the story  an assistant could  tell me what  he  saw  but he could not bring to me what would be  conveyed if i saw it myself  all that was individual in my work would be  gone  minds do not work together like that  i should be too much in the  dark   he concluded  sadly     for a long time her head was on his shoulder  she was giving him of that  silent sympathy which came with an eternal freshness from her heart      we ll manage pretty well   he went on  in a lighter tone which did not  quite deceive her   our life is not going to be one long spell of moping   it s time now for the year s work to begin  you must get at your  pictures  and i ll get at the books  oh  i ll get interested in them   all right  and oh  liebchen   with a tenderness which swept all else  aside   i have  you             chapter xxiii      her vision    some of the university people came over that night to see karl  ernestine  was glad of that  for she had been dreading the evening  their talk of  the afternoon had made it more clear and more hard than it had ever been  before     her mothering instinct had been supreme that summer  it had dominated her  so completely as to blur slightly the clearness of her intellectual  vision  to be doing things for him  making him as comfortable as  possible  to find occupation for him as one does for the convalescent  to  hover about him  showering him with manifestations of her love and  woman s protectiveness  it had stirred the mother in her  and in the  depths of her sorrow there had been a sublime joy     now she could not see her way ahead  it was her constant doing things to   make it up to him  had made the summer bearable at all  with the  clearing of her vision her sustaining power seemed taken from her      and how has it gone with you this summer   professor hastings asked   holding both of her hands for a minute in fatherly fashion as she met him  in the hall     he scarcely heard her reply  for the thought came to him   if he could  only see her now      it was her pride and her wistfulness  her courage and her appeal  the  union of defiance and tenderness which held one strangely in the face of  ernestine  she was as the figure of love standing there wounded but  unvanquished before the blows of fate      professor hastings has come to see you  karl   she said  as they entered  the library  and as he rose she laid her hand very gently upon his arm  a  touch which seemed more like an unconscious little movement of affection  than an assistance      good for hastings   said karl  with genuine heartiness      and have a good many thought waves from me come to you this summer   he  asked  shaking karl s hand with a warmth which conveyed the things he  left unsaid      yes  they ve come   karl replied   oh  we knew our friends were with  us    a little hastily   but we ve had a pretty good summer  haven t we   ernestine   turning his face to her      in many ways it has been a delightful summer    her voice now had that  blending of defiance and appeal  and as she looked at her husband and  smiled it flashed through professor hastings  mind   he knew she did  that       you see    after they were seated   i was really very uneducated  isn t  it surprising  hastings  how much some of us don t know  now what do you  know about the history of art  could you pass a sophomore examination in  it  well  i couldn t until ernestine began coaching me up this summer   now i m quite fit to appear before women s clubs as a lecturer on art   literature  too  i m getting on with  i m getting acquainted with all the  swedes and the irishmen and the poles who ever put pen to paper       karl   she protested   swedes and irishmen and poles       isn t that what they are   he demanded  innocently      well they re not exactly a lot of immigrants       yes they are  immigrants into the domain of my  shall i say  intellectuality      they laughed a little  and there was a moment s pause   tell me about  school   he said  abruptly  his voice all changed     professor hastings felt the censorship of ernestine s eyes upon him as he  talked  they travelled with a frightened eagerness from the face of the  man who spoke to him who listened  he could see them deepen as they  touched dangerous ground  and he wondered how she could go on living with  that intensity of feeling      beason is back   he said  in telling of the returnings and the changes      beason    dr  hubers  voice rang out charged with a significance the  older man could not understand   you say beason is back    the voice then  was as if something had broken      yes  it was unexpected  he had thought he would be west this year  but  things turned out better than he had expected       yes  he told me  in april  that he would be west this year   as he sank  back  his face in repose  professor hastings saw something of what the  summer had done     ernestine s eyes were upon him  a little reproachful  and beseeching  but  before he could think of anything redeeming to say two other university  men had been admitted     it was hard at first  dr  hubers did not rouse himself to more than the  merest conventionality  and all the rest of it was left to his wife  who   however  rose to the situation with a superb graciousness  finally they  touched a topic which roused karl  his mind reached out to it with his  old eagerness and virility  and they were soon in the heat of one of  those discussions which wage when men of active mind and kindred interest  are brought together     ernestine sat for a little time listening to them  grateful for the  relaxation of the tension  more grateful still for this touch of karl s  old time self  but following upon that the very consciousness that they  saw the real karl so seldom now brought added pain  what would the future  hold  what could it hold  must he not go farther and farther from this  real self as he adjusted himself more and more fully to the new order of  things     watching him then  as he talked and listened  she could appreciate anew  what karl s eyes had meant to his personality  it almost broke her heart  to see him lean forward and look in that half eager  half fretted way  toward the man who was speaking  as though his blindness were a barrier  between their minds  a barrier he instinctively tried to beat down     she wanted to get away  and she felt they would get along better now  without her  so she left them  laughingly  to their cigars and their  discussion     she wandered about the house listlessly  mechanically doing a few things  here and there  and then  still aimlessly  she went up to her studio  she  sat down on the floor  leaning her head against the couch  just then she  looked like a very tired  disappointed child     and it was with something of a child s simplicity she saw things  then  was it right to treat karl that way  karl who was so great and  good  could do such big things  was it fair or right that karl should be  unhappy  karl who did so much for other people  and who had all this  sweetness and tenderness with the greatness     what could she do for karl  she loved him enough to lay down her life for  him  then was there not some way she could use her life to make things  better for him     and so she sat there  her thoughts brooding over him  too tired for  anything but very simple thinking  too worn for passion  but filled with  the sadness of a grieving child  it was after she had been looking  straight at it for a long time that she realised she was looking at a  picture on her easel     dimly  uncaringly  she knew what the picture was  but she was thinking  only of karl  it was a long time before her mind really followed her eyes  to the picture     it was a sketch of a woman s face  she remembered what a splendid model  she had had for it  and then suddenly her mind went full upon it  her  whole bearing changed  she leaned forward with a passionate intentness     unsatisfied longing  disappointed motherhood  deep  deep things stirred  only to be denied  yes  the model had been a good one  but it was from  her own soul the life things in that face had come     it brought them all back now  all those things she had put into it  a  great wave of passion and yearning swept through her   new questionings   sorrow touched with resentment  longing mingled with defiance  why could  not this have gone right with them  what it would have meant to karl in  these days   sustained  comforted  kept strong     the pain of those first days was translated by the deeper understanding  of these  her eyes were very deep  about her mouth an infinite yearning  as she asked some of those questions for which god had no answer     but there was something about the picture she did not like  she looked at  it with a growing dissatisfaction  and then she saw what it was  the  woman was sinking to melancholy  she bowed under the hand of fate  she  did not know why  this night of all others  she should resent that  what  did she want  what could she expect     she stirred restlessly under the dissatisfaction  it seemed too much  fate s triumph to leave it like this  not this surrender  but a little of  the spartan  a touch of sternness  a little defiance in the hunger  an  understanding  that was it   a submission in which there was the dignity  of understanding  ah  here it was   a knowing that thousands had endured  and must endure  but as an echo from the stoics   well      the idea fascinated her  swept through her with a strange  wild  passion  she scarcely knew what she was doing  when  after a long  time of looking at the picture  she began getting out her things  her  face had wholly changed  she too had now the understanding  stern   all comprehending   well    for fate     she could work  that was the thing remained  she would not bow down under  it and submit  she would work  she would erect something to stand for  their love  something so great  so universal and eternal that it would  make up for all taken away  she would crystallise their lives into  something so big and supreme that karl himself  feeling  understanding  that which he could not see  would come at the end into all the  satisfaction of the victor  could she do greater things for him than  that     she glowed under the idea  it filled  thrilled  intoxicated her  and she  could do it  as she saw that a few master strokes were visualising her  idea she came into greater consciousness of her power than she had ever  had before     it all flowed into big new impetus for her work  a year before she had  wanted to work because she was so happy  now with a fierce passion she  turned to her work as the thing to make it right for their lives  out of  all this she would rise to so great an understanding  so supreme a power  that they too could hurl their defiant   well    at the fate which had  believed them conquered  in the glow and the passion and the exaltation  of it she felt that nothing in the world  no trick of fate  no onslaught  of god or man  could keep her from the work that was hers  she had a  vision of hosts of men  all powers of fate  marching against her  and  she  unfaltering  serene  confident  just doing her work  it was one of  the perfect moments of the divine intoxication     it was in the very glow of it that the strange thing happened  the lights  from her ruby  caught in a shaft of light  blurred her vision for an  instant  and in that same instant  as if borne with the lights of the  stone  there penetrated her glowing  exuberant mood  quick  piercing   like an arrow shot in with strong  true hand   he loves his work just  like this  you know now  you understand      her mood fell away like a pricked bubble  the divine glow  that  passionate throbbing of conscious power  made way for the comprehension  of that thing shot in upon her like a shaft    he loves his work just  like this  you know now  you understand      she had been standing  and she sank to a chair  like all great changes it  sapped up strength  the blood had cooled too suddenly  and she was weak  and trembling  but  oh  how she understood  he himself did not understand  it as she understood it now     pushing upon him  dominating him  clamouring  crowding for outlet when  outlet had been closed  gathering  growing  and unable to find its valve  of escape  why it would crowd upon him  kill him  beat it down  but it  was the deathless in him  with human strength put out a fire that was  divine     she covered her face with her hands to shut it out  but she could not  shut it out  it was there  a thing to be faced  not evaded  a thing which  would grow  not draw away  and she loved him so  in this moment of  perfect understanding  this divine camaraderie of the soul  knowing that  they were touched with the same touch  drew from a common fount  she felt  within her a love for him  an understanding  which all of the centuries  behind her  the eternity out of which she had come  had gone to make     and then  grim  stern  she put her intellect upon it  she went over  everything he had said that afternoon  each thought of it opened up new  channels  and she followed them all to their uttermost  and in that  getting of it in hand there was more than insight  knowledge  conviction   there was a complete sensing of the truth  a comprehending of things just  without the pale of reason     her face pale  her eyes looking into that far distance  she sat there for  more than an hour  oblivious for the first time since his blindness to  the thought that karl might be needing her  lost to all conventional  instincts as hostess  hard and fast the thoughts beat upon her  and then  at last in the wake of those thoughts  out beyond  there was born a great  light  it staggered her at first  it seemed a light too great for human  mind to bear  but time passed  and the light burned on  steady  fixed   not to pass away  and in that momentous hour which words are quite  powerless to record  something was buried  and something born           chapter xxiv      love challenges fate    the doctor hung up the receiver slowly and with meditation  and when he  turned from the telephone his thoughts did not leave the channel to which  it had directed them  what was it mrs  hubers wanted  why was she coming  to the office at four that afternoon  something in her voice made him  wonder     he had offered to go out  but she preferred coming to the office   evidently then she wished to see him alone  and she had specified that  she come when he could give her the most time  then there was something  to talk over  he had asked for karl  and she answered  cheerfully  that  he was well   and you   he pursued  and she had laughed with that  an  underlying significance in that laugh perplexed him as he recalled it   and had answered buoyantly   i  oh  splendid      it did not leave his mind all day  he thought about it a great deal as he  drove his car from place to place  it even came to him in the operating  room  and it was not usual for anything to intrude there     he reached the office a few minutes ahead of the hour  but she was  waiting for him  she rose as she saw him at the door and took an eager  step forward  her cheeks were flushed  her eyes very bright  and her  smile  as she held out her hand  had that same quality as her voice of  the morning     she was so far removed from usual things that she resorted to no  conventional pleasantries after they had entered the doctor s inner  office  and she waited for him to attend to a few little things before  giving her his attention  he knew by the way her eyes followed him about  that she was eager to begin  and while there was a little timidity about  her it seemed just a timidity of manner  of things exterior  while back  of that he felt the force of her poise     he had never seen her so beautiful  she was wearing a brown velvet suit   a golden brown like some of the glints in her hair and some of the lights  in her eyes  her eyes  too  held that something which puzzled him  it was  a windy day  and her hair was a little disarranged  which made her look  very young  and her veil was thrown back from her face just right to make  a frame for it  why could not all women manage those big veils the way  some women did  he wondered     he sat down in the chair before his desk  and swung it around facing her   then he waited for her to speak     that little timidity was upon her for the second  but she broke through  it  seeming to shake it off with a little shake of her head   dr   parkman   she said  her voice was low and well controlled   i have come  to you because i want you to help me      he liked that  very few people came out with the truth at the start that  way      i wonder if you know   she went on  looking at him with a very sweet  seriousness   that karl is very unhappy      his face showed that that was unexpected   why  yes   he assented   i  know that his heart has not been as philosophical as some of his words   but   gently   what can you expect      she did not answer that  but pondered something a minute   dr  parkman    she began abruptly   just why do you think it is karl cannot go on with  his work  i do not mean his lectures  but his own work in the laboratory   the research      again he showed that she was surprising him   why surely you understand  that  it is self evident  is it not  he cannot do his laboratory work  because he has lost his eyes       eyes  yes  but the eye is only an instrument  he has not lost his  brain   the flush in her cheeks deepened  her eyes met his in challenge   her voice on that had been very firm     he was quick to read beyond the words   you are asking  intending to ask   why he could not go on  working through some assistant       i want to know just what is your idea of why he cannot  all the things  of mind and temperament  things which make him karl  are there as before   are we not letting a very little thing hold us back    there was much  repression now  as though she must hold herself in check  and wait      i ve thought about it too   he exclaimed   heaven knows i ve tried to  see it that way  but my conclusion has always been like karl s  the  handicap would be too great       why   she asked calmly      why  why  because   he replied  almost impatiently  and then laughed a  little at his woman s reason      i ll tell you why    her eyes deepening   i ll tell you the secret of  your conclusion  you concluded he could not go on with his work just  because no assistant could be in close enough touch with karl to make  clear the things he saw      he thought a minute  then   that s about it   he answered briefly      you concluded that two men s brains could not work together in close  enough harmony for one man s eyes to fit the other man s brain       you put it very clearly   he assented     she paused  as though to be very sure of herself here   then  doctor   looking a little farther into it  one sees something else  if there were  some one close enough to karl to bring to his brain  through some other  medium than eyes  the things the eyes would naturally carry  if there  were some one close enough to make things just as plain as though  karl were seeing them himself  then   her voice gathered in  intensity   despite the loss of his eyes  he could go right on with his  work       um  well  yes  if such an impossible thing were possible       but it  is  possible  oh if i can only make you see this now  doctor    don t  you see it   i  am closer to him than any one in the world   i   am the one to take up his work      he pushed back his chair and sat staring at her speechlessly      dr  parkman   she began  and it seemed now that he had never known her  at all before   most of the biggest things ever proposed in this world  have sounded very ridiculous to the people who first heard of them  the  unprecedented has usually been called the impossible  now i ask you to do  just one thing  don t hold my idea at arm s length as an impossibility   look it straight in the face without prejudice  who would do more for  karl than any one else on earth  who is closer to him than any one else  in the world  who can make him see without seeing   yet  know without  knowing  dr  parkman    voice eager  eyes very tender   is there any  question in your mind as to who can come closest to karl       but  but    he gasped      i know   she hastened   much to talk over  so many things to overcome   but won t you be very fair to me and look at it first as a whole  the men  in karl s laboratory know more about science than i do  but they do not  know as much about karl  they have the science and i have the spirit  i  can get the science but they could never get the spirit  after all  isn t  there some meaning in that old phrase  a labour of love   doctor   her  smile made it so much clearer than her words   did you ever hear of  knowledge and skill working a miracle  do you know anything save love  which can do the impossible      he did not speak at once  he did not find it easy to answer words like  that   but  my dear mrs  hubers   he finally began   you are simply  assuming        yes    and the tenderness leaped suddenly to passion and the passion  intensified to sternness   i am simply assuming that it  can  be  done  and through obstacle and argument  from now until the end of my  life  i am going on assuming that very thing  and furthermore  dr   parkman    relaxing a little and smiling at him under standingly   just  as soon as the light has fully dawned upon you   you  are going to  begin assuming that  and you are the very man  oh  i know  to keep on  assuming it in the face of all the obstacles which the university of  chicago  yes  and all creation  may succeed in piling up  there is one  thing on which you and i are going to stand very firmly together  that  thing    with the deep quiet of finality   is that karl shall go on with  his work      dr  parkman had never been handled that way before  perhaps it was its  newness which fascinated him  at any rate he seemed unable to say the  things he felt he should be saying      dr  parkman  the only weak people in this world are the people who sit  down and say that things are impossible  the only big people are the  people who stand up and declare in the face of whatsoever comes that  nothing is impossible  for karl there is some excuse  the shock has been  too great  his blindness has shut him in  but you and i are out in the  light of day  doctor  and i say that you and i have been weaklings long  enough      he had never been called a weakling before  he had never thought to be  called a weakling  but the strangeness of that was less strange than  something in her eyes  her voice  her spirit  which seemed drawing him  on      karl has lost his eyes  has he lost his brain  any of those things which  make him karl  all that has been taken away is the channel of  communication  i am not presuming to be his brain  all i ask is to carry  things to the brain  why  doctor   i m ashamed   mortified   that we  hadn t thought of it before       but  how   he finally asked  weakly enough      i will go into karl s laboratory and learn how to work  all that part of  it i want you to arrange for me  after all  i have a good foundation  i  think i told you about my father  and how hard he tried to make a  scientist of me  and it was queer about my laboratory work  it was always  easy for me  i could  see  it  all right  enough my father s child for  that  but you see my working enthusiasm and ambition were given to other  things  now i ll make things within me join forces  for i  will  love the  work now  because of what it can do for karl  i need to be trained how to  work  how to observe  and above all else learn to tell exactly what i  see  i shall strive to become a perfectly constructed instrument  that s  all  and i  will  be better than the usual laboratory assistant  for not  having any ideas of my own i will not intrude my individuality upon  karl  to blur his vision  i shall not try to deduce  and mislead him with  my wrong conclusions  i shall simply  see   a man who knew more about it  might not be able to separate what he saw from what he thought  and that  would be standing between karl and the facts      he was looking at her strangely   and your own work  what would be  happening to it  if you were to do  this       i have given my own work up   she said  and she said it so simply that  it might have seemed a very simply matter      you can t do that   he met her  sharply      yes    slowly   i can  i love it  but i love karl more  if i have my  work he cannot have his  and karl has been deprived of his eyes  he is  giving up the sunlight  the stars  the face he loves  many things  i  thought it all out last night  and the very simple justice of it is that  karl is the one to have his work      she was dwelling upon it   a wonderful tenderness lighting her face  for  the minute she had forgotten him     then suddenly she came sharply back to the practical  brought herself  ruthlessly back to it  as if fearing it was her practicality he would  question   besides  karl s work is the more important  nobody is going to  die for a water colour or an oil painting  people are dying every day for  the things karl can give  but  doctor    far too feminine not to press  the advantage   if i can do  that   don t you think you can afford to  break through your conservatism and  you  will   doctor  won t you      but dr  parkman had wheeled his chair about so that she could not see his  face  his eyes had grown a little dim      you see  doctor    gently    what i am going to give to it  not only the  things any one else could give  but all my love for karl  and added to  that all those things within myself which have heretofore been poured  into my own work  i  can  paint  doctor  you and i know that  and i think  you know something of how i love it  something inside of me has always  been given to it  a great big something for which there is no name  now i  am going to just force all that into a new channel  and don t you see how  much there will be to give  and in practical ways too i can make my own  work count  i know how to use my hands  and there isn t a laboratory  assistant in the whole university of chicago knows as much about colour  as i do    she smiled like a pleased child     he looked at her then  a long look  he had forgotten the moisture in his  eyes   he did not mind  and it was many years since any one had seen upon  dr  parkman s face the look which ernestine saw there now      isn t it strange  doctor   she went on  after a pause   how we think we  understand  and then suddenly awake to find we have not been  understanding at all  karl and i had a long talk yesterday  and in that  talk he seemed able to let me right into it all  all summer long i did my  best  but i see now i had not been understanding  and understanding as i  do now  caring as i care  do you think i can sit quietly by and see karl  make himself over to fit this miserable situation  do you think i am  going to help him adjust himself to giving up the great thing in him   no  he is not going to accept it  i tell you karl is to be karl  he is to  do karl s work  and find karl s place  why i tell you  dr  parkman  i  will not  have  it any other way      it was a passionate tyranny of the spirit over which caution of mind  seemed unable to prevail  his reason warned him  i cannot see how this  and this and that are to be done  but the soul in her voice seemed  drawing him to a light out beyond the darkness      doctor    her eyes glowing with a tender pride   think of it  think of  karl doing his work in spite of his blindness  won t it stand as one of  the greatest things in the whole history of science      he nodded  the light of enthusiasm growing more steady in his own eye      but i have not finished telling you  after our talk yesterday it seemed  to me i could not go on at all  i didn t know what to do  in the evening  i was up in my studio     she paused  striving to formulate it    no  i  see i can t tell it  but suddenly things came to me  and  doctor  i  understand it now better than karl understands it himself      he felt the things which she did not say  indeed through it all it was  the unspoken drew him most irresistibly      i ll not try to tell you how it all worked itself out  but i saw things  very clearly then  and all the facts and all the reason and all the logic  in the world could not make me believe i did not see the truth  my idea  of taking it up myself  of my being the one to bring karl back to his  work  seemed to come to me like some great divine light  i suppose   she  concluded  simply   that it was what you would call a moment of  inspiration      she leaned her head back as though very tired  but smiling a little  he  did not speak  he had too much the understanding heart to intrude upon  the things shining from her face      i could do good work  doctor  i ve always felt it  and i have done just  enough to justify me in knowing it  i don t believe any one ever loved  his work more than i love mine  and last night when i saw things so  clearly i saw how the longing for it would come to me  oh  i know  don t  think i do not know  but something will sustain me  something will keep  my courage high  and that something is the look there will be on karl s  face when i tell him what i have done  you see we will not tell karl at  first  we will keep it a great secret  he will know i am working hard   but will think it is my own work  if we told him now he would say it was  impossible  his blindness  the helplessness that goes with it  has taken  away some of his confidence  and he would say it could not be done  but  what will he say    she laughed  almost gleefully   when he finds i have  gone ahead and made myself ready for him  when  you  tell him i can do  it  and the laboratory men tell him so  he will try it then  just out of  gratitude to me  oh  it will not go very well at first  it is going to  take practice  days and weeks and months of it  to learn how to work  together  but  little by little  he will gain confidence in himself and  in me  he will begin getting back his grip  enthusiasm  all the things of  the old time karl  and then some day when we have had a little success  about something he will burst forth   by jove  ernestine  i believe we   can  make it go    and that   she concluded  softly   will be worth it  all to me      again a silence which sank deeper than words  a silence which sealed  their compact     she came from it with the vigorously practical   now  dr   parkman    sitting up very straight  with an assertive little  gesture   you go out to that university and fire their souls  wake them  up  make them  see  it  and when do you think i can begin      that turned them to actual issues  he spoke freely of difficulties  and  they discussed them together calmly  her enthusiasm was not builded on  dreams alone  it was not of that volatile stuff which must perish in  detail and difficulty  she was ready to meet it all  to ponder and plan   and where he had been carried by her enthusiasm he was held by her  resourcefulness      are august dignitaries of reason and judgment likely to rise up and make  it very unpleasant for you after i ve gone   she asked him  laughingly   when she had risen to go      very likely to   he laughed      tell them it s not their affair  tell them to do what they re told and  not ask too many questions       i ll try to put them in their proper place   he assured her     he watched her as she stood there buttoning her glove  slight  almost  frail  scarcely one s idea of a  masterful woman   it struck him then as  strange that she had not so much as asked for pledge of his allegiance   what was it about her       she was holding out her hand  something in her eyes lighted and glorified  her whole face   thank you  doctor   she said  very low     for a long time he sat motionless before his desk  he was thinking of  many things   nothing in which to believe   he murmured at last  looking  about the room still warm with the spirit she had left   nothing in which  to believe  when there is love such as this in the world            chapter xxv      dr  parkman s way    the next morning dr  parkman turned his automobile in the direction of  the university of chicago  there was a very grim look on his face as he  sent the car  with the hand of an expert  through the crowded streets  he  had his do or die expression  and the way he was letting the machine out  would not indicate a shrinking back from what lay before him  he rather  chuckled once  that is  it began in a chuckle  and ended with the  semblance of a grunt  and when he finally swung the car down the midway   he was saying to himself   glad of it  i ve been wanting for a long time  to tell that lane what i thought of him      inquiries over the telephone had developed the fact that through some  shifting about  dr  george lane was temporary head of the department  it  was to dr  george lane then that dr  parkman must go with the matter in  hand this morning  that had seemed bad at first  for lane was one man out  there he couldn t get on with and did not want to  they always clashed   upon their last meeting lane had said   really now  dr  parkman  don t  you feel that a broader culture is the real need of the medical  profession   and parkman had retorted   shouldn t wonder  but has it ever  struck you  dr  lane  that a little more horse sense is the real need of  the university professor   he declared  grimly  as he finally drew his  car to a snorting stop at the university that he would have to try some  other method than  firing his soul   as ernestine had bade him do   in  the first place   he figured it out   he has no soul  and if he had  i  wouldn t be the one to fire it with anything but rage   but the doctor  was not worrying much about results  he thought he had a little  ammunition in reserve which assured the outcome  and which would enable  him  at the same time  to  let loose on lane   should the latter show a  tendency to become too important     the erudite lane was a neatly built little fellow  very spick and span   first america and then england had done their best  or worst  by him   just as every hair on his head was properly brushed  so dr  parkman felt  quite sure that every idea within the head was properly beaten down with  a pair of intellectual military brushes  one of which he had acquired to  the west  and the other to the east of the atlantic   i suppose he s a  scholar   mused the doctor  as he surveyed the back of the dignitary s  head while waiting   but what in god s name would he do if he were ever  to be hit with an original idea       ah  yes  dr  parkman  we so seldom see you very busy men out here  we  always appreciate it when you busy men look in upon us      now the tone did not appeal to dr  parkman  and with one of his quick  decisions he bade tact take itself to the four winds  leaving him alone  with his reserve guns      i always appreciate it   he began abruptly  not attempting to deny that  he was a busy man   when people take as little of my time as possible  i  will try to do unto others as i would that others do unto me      by the merest lifting of his eyebrows  lane signified that he would make  no attempt at detaining the doctor longer than he wished to stay  he  awaited punctiliously the other man s pleasure  silently emphasising that  the interview was not of his bringing about   thinks i m a boor and a  brute   mused parkman      what i wanted to see you about   he began   relates to dr  hubers       ah  yes  poor hubers  a remarkable man  in many ways  it is one of those  things which make one  very sad  we wanted him to go on with his  lectures  but he did not seem to feel quite equal to it       huh    that might mean a variety of things  the tone of patronage  infuriated karl s friend   jealous  sore  glad karl s out of it   he was  interpreting it     then he delivered this very calmly   well  the fact of the matter is   that among all medical men  and in that part of the scientific world  which i may call the active part  the only part of any real value  karl  hubers is regarded so far above every other man who ever set foot in this  university that all the rest of the place is looked upon as something  which surrounds him  over in europe  they say  chicago   university of  chicago  oh  yes  yes indeed  i remember now  that s where hubers is        the professor   as dr  parkman frequently insisted on calling him   showed himself capable of a rush of red blood to the face  and of a very  human engulfing of emotion in a hurried cough   ah  i see you are a warm  friend  dr  parkman   quickly regaining his impenetrable superiority  and  smiling tolerantly   but looking at it quite dispassionately  putting  aside sympathy and all personal feeling  i have sometimes felt that dr   hubers  in spite of his  i may say gifts  in some directions  is a little  lacking in that broad culture  that finer quality of universal  scholarship which should dominate the ideal university man of to day      dr  parkman was smiling in a knowing way to himself   i see what you  mean  professor  though i would put it a little differently  i wouldn t  call him in the least lacking in broad culture  but he is rather lacking  in pedantry  in limitations  in intellectual snobbery  in university  folderols  and of course a man who is actually doing something in the  world  who stands for real achievement  has a little less time to look  after the fine quality of universal scholarship      perhaps lane would have been either more or less than human  had he not  retorted to that   but as to this great achievement  it has never been  forthcoming  has it      the doctor had a little nervous affection of his face  the corner of one  eye and one corner of his mouth sometimes twitched a little  people who  knew him well were apt to grow nervous themselves when they made that  observation  but as no one who knew him chanced to be present  the storm  broke all unannounced      for which   he snarled out   every cheap skate of a university professor  who never did anything himself but paddle other men s canoes  for which  every human phonograph and intellectual parrot sends out thanks from his  two by four soul  but among men who are men  among physicians who have  cause to know his worth  among scientists big enough to get out of their  own shadows  and  thank god  among the people who haven t been fossilised  by clammy universities out of all sense of human values  among them  i  say  karl hubers is appreciated for what he was close to doing when this  damnable fate stepped in and stopped him      the man of broad culture  very white as to the face  rose to his fullest  height  it should not be held against him that his fullest height failed  in reaching the other man s shoulder   if there is nothing further   he  choked out   perhaps we may consider the interview concluded       no   retorted parkman serenely   the interview has just begun  it s your  business  isn t it  to listen to matters relating to this department       it is  but as i am accustomed to meeting men of some        manners   supplied the doctor pleasantly   as i am accustomed to men of  a somewhat different type    he picked the phrase punctiliously   manifestly a conservative  even in war   i was naturally unprepared for  the nature of your remarks       oh well  the unexpected must be rather agreeable when one leads so cut  and dried a life  but what i want to see you about   he went on  quite as  though he had dropped the most pleasant thing in the world   is just  this  i want you to give the use of dr  hubers  laboratory  his equipment  and at least one of his assistants  to dr  hubers  wife  that she may get  in shape to work with him as his assistant  and enable him to carry on  his work and do those things  which  as you correctly state  are still  unachieved      now the delivering of that pleased dr  parkman very much  he scarcely  attempted to conceal his righteous pride      really  now   gasped the head of the department  after a minute of  speechless staring   really  now  dr  parkman  you astonish me     that s  the truth  if he ever spoke it   thought the doctor grimly    dr  hubers   wife  i understand you to say    and he of erudition was equal to a  covert sneer   just what has she to do with it  please       she has everything to do with it  in the first place  she is rather  interested in dr  hubers  then she s a remarkable woman  needs to  freshen up on some things  needs quite a little coaching  in fact  but in  my judgment the best way for hubers to go on with his work  you didn t  think for a moment he was out of it  did you   is for his wife to get in  shape to work with him  that can be arranged all right   he concluded  pleasantly     then dr  george lane spoke with the authority in him vested   it  certainly can not   he said  with an icy decisiveness      but why not   pursued parkman  innocently      oh  now  don t misunderstand me  professor  i didn t for a minute expect  that you were to give any of your valuable time to mrs  hubers  hastings  is the fellow i d like her turned over to  he s a friend of mine  and  he s in sympathy  you know  with dr  hubers  work  all you ll have to do  is to tell hastings to do it   explained the doctor  expansively     the head of the department quite gleamed with the pride of authority as  he pronounced   which you may be very certain i shall not do       no   said parkman  leaning over the desk a little and looking at him    you say  no       i do   replied the man in authority  with brevity  emphasis and  finality     dr  parkman leaned back in his chair and seemed to be in deep thought    then the popular idea is all wrong  isn t it       i am at a loss to know to what popular idea you refer   said the  professor  with a suitable indifference      oh merely to the popular idea that this place amounts to something  that  it has let go of a little mediaevalism  and is more than a crude  cheap  pattern  funny what ideas people get  isn t it  now there are people who  think the university here puts a value on individuality  that it would  actually bend a rule or two to fit an individual case  in fact that it  likes initiative  encourages originality  wouldn t in the least mind  having a few actual achievements to its credit       at the same time   goaded from his icy calm   it does not propose to  make itself ridiculous       and doing a rather unconventional thing  in order to bring about a very  great thing  would be making itself ridiculous  would it       i fail to see how anything so preposterous could bring about good  results   said the man in authority  introducing into that a note of  dismissal      do you   replied parkman  not yet dismissed   well  if you will pardon a  little more plain speaking  i will say that this is something i know a  good deal more about than you do       we have made other arrangements for the laboratory   and the professor  picked up a paper from his desk and looked it over  nice subtilties  evidently being lost      so  going to give it to some fellow who will devote himself  after the  fashion of university men  to verifying other men s conclusions      then dr  parkman rose   well   he said   you ve had your chance  you had  a chance to do something which would give this place an excuse for  existing  i m sorry you weren t big enough to take it      i fear medical men may feel some little prejudice about this   he  remarked  easily  not in the least as though dealing in heavy ammunition    hubers commands the medical men  you know  they care more for him than  for all the rest of the fellows out here put together  about that medical  school of yours   he said  meditatively   that you re pushing so hard  just now   to whom shall i tender my resignation as chairman of the  committee i m on  and  at the same time  i ll just be released from the  lectures i was to give in the winter quarter  i m entirely too busy to  spend my time on a place that doesn t care for anything but dead men s  bones  lewis and richmond will probably want to pull out too  of course    he went on  seemingly to himself   a thing like this will unfortunately  be noised about  and all doctors will be a little sore about your not  caring to stand by hubers  but i suppose i had better see the president  about all that  he gets home next week  and  come to think of it  i m  pretty close to a couple of members of the board  i operated on both  lessing and tyler  both of those fellows have a notion they owe their  lives to me  that makes people feel rather close to one  you know  but  then  of course  you don t know  why should you  and  dear me  there s  that rich old patient of mine  burley  now isn t it strange    turning  genially to lane  as if merely interesting him in a philosophical  proposition   how one thing leads to another  i fear burley may not be so  interested in making that gift to the new medical building  if he knows  i ve cut loose from the place  the president will feel rather sore  about that  too   you know how the president is about such things  but  then    shrugging his shoulders indifferently   he needn t feel sore at  me      dr  george lane was swallowing very hard  though learned  he was not  dull  word by word he had drunk in the bitter truth that this big  dark   gruff  ill mannered man was not to be put down with impunity  call it  bullying  any hard name you would  there was no evading the fact that it  was power in sledge hammer strokes   the professor  was just wise enough  to see that there lay before him the unpleasant task of retraction      ah  of course  doctor   he began  striving for nonchalance   do not take  this as too final  you see anything so unusual as this will have to come  before the committee  you did not present it to me  ah  very fully  but  the more i consider it  the more i am disposed to think it is a thing  we  may care to undertake  i  will present it       oh  don t bother about that   said the doctor pleasantly   i wouldn t  worry the committee about it  if i were you  i can get a down town  laboratory all right  i simply thought i would give the university a  chance at the thing  it doesn t matter   he concluded  opening the door      well now  i ll tell you  doctor   said lane  and part of his face was  white  and part of it was red   while you re out here  you would  better go up and see hastings  i m sure i can say  speaking for the  committee  that we will be very glad to have mrs  hubers here       i fired his soul all right   thought the doctor  grimly  as he walked up  to find hastings   those little two by fours            chapter xxvi      old fashioned love    karl s new secretary was what karl himself called  one of those  philosophical ducks    that is   he explained to ernestine   he is one of  those fellows who has been graduated from science into philosophy       but wouldn t you get on better with one of the scientific students who  hadn t been graduated yet   she laughed      oh  no  no  i don t mind having a graduate  ross can do the work all  right  i m lucky to get him  there aren t many of them who are  stenographers  and then he can give me most of his time  he s finishing  up for his ph d       and was he really a student of science in the beginning       well  after a fashion  the kind that is graduated into philosophy       karl   she laughed   despite your proud boast to the contrary  you re  bigoted  it s the bigotry of science       no  it s having science patronised by these fellows who don t know  anything about it  if they d once roll up their sleeves and do some  actual work they d give up that idea of being so easily graduated  but  they want to get where they ll not have to work  philosophy s a lazy  man s job       there you go again  a clear case of the scientific arrogance       no  they amuse me  that s all   i had a great deal of science in my  undergraduate work   mr  ross said   but i feel now that i want to go  into the larger field of philosophy        karl   she laughed  a little amused and a little indignant   did he  actually say that to you       he actually did  and with the pleasantest  most off hand air  it was on  the tip of my tongue to reply   fortunately  science never loses anything  in these people she graduates so easily into philosophy       i wonder what they think   he went on   when we turn them upside down  two or three times a century  it doesn t seem to worry them any   give me  some eggs and some milk and some sugar and i ll make a nice pudding    they say  that s about what goes into a pudding  isn t it  and then they  take the stuff in very thankless fashion  and when their pudding is done   they say   isn t it pathetic the way some people spend their lives  producing nothing but eggs and milk and sugar   and the worst of it is  that half the time they spoil our good stuff by putting it together  wrong       such a waste of good eggs and milk and sugar   she laughed      but fortunately it is a superior kind of eggs and milk and sugar that  can t be hurt by being thrown together wrong  the pudding is bad  but the  good stuff in it is indestructible  and as we don t have to sit down to  their table  why should we worry over their failures       why  indeed  but then  i don t agree that all puddings are bad       no  not all of them  but it rubs me the wrong way to see bad cooks take  such liberties with their materials       because good eggs and milk and sugar aren t so easy to produce   she  agreed      some of us have paid a pretty good price for them   he said     that turned them to the things always close to them  and they were silent  for a time  it was saturday evening  and on monday ernestine would begin  her new work  dr  parkman had arranged it for her  she did not know how   but it had been done  and professor hastings  who would have her in  charge  was eager to give all possible help  that day  while karl was  busy  she had been reading a book dr  parkman had given her  he would  keep her supplied with the best things for her to read  he said   selecting that which was vital  so that she would not waste time  blundering through karl s library at random  dr  parkman was being so  splendid about it all  he was a man to give himself to a thing without  reservations  if he helped at all he made his help count to the  uttermost  she felt him back of her as a force which would not fail  and  she would show him his confidence was not misplaced  his support not  given to a vain cause  resolution strengthened within her as the way was  cleared  unconsciously she caught karl s hand and held it tight in both  of hers      you know  liebchen   he said  caressing her hand in response   i ve done  considerable thinking of late  perhaps a fellow thinks more about things  when he is not right in them  and it seemed to me to day  when i was  thinking over these things suggested by ross  that the reason most people  don t get on better with their work is just because they don t care for  it enough  you have to love a thing to do much with it  take it in any  kind of scientific work  the work is hard  there is detail  drudgery  and  discouragement  you re going to lose heart and grip unless you have that  enthusiasm for the thing as a whole  you must see it big  and have  that  well  call it fanaticism  if you want to  a willingness to give  yourself up to it  at any rate  the reason these fellows want to get into  the  bigger field of philosophy  is because they ve never known anything  about the bigger field of science      she loved that fire in his voice  that rare  fine light which at times  like this shone from his face  in such moments  he seemed a man set  apart  as one divinely appointed  it filled her heart with a warm  glad  rush to think it was she would bring him back to his own  it was she  would reseat karl on his throne  and what awaited him then  might not his  possibilities be greater than ever before  would not determination rise  in him with new tremendousness  and would not hope  after its rebirth in  despair  soar to undreamed of heights  would not the meditation of these  days  the new understanding rising from relinquishment and suffering   bring him back to his work a scientist who was also philosopher     she believed that that would be true  that the things his blindness  taught him to see would more than atone for the things shut away  and  would not she herself come to love the work just because of what it meant  to karl  care for it because of what it could do for him  loving it first  because he loved it  would not she come to love it for itself     a quiver of pain had drawn the beautiful light from his face   tell me  about your work  dear   he said abruptly   you haven t said much about it  of late      she turned away her face  she was always forgetting that he could not see  her face      you know you must get to work  sweetheart   he went on as she did not  answer   i am expecting great things of my little girl       i hope you will not be disappointed   she answered  very low      of course i ll not be  if you just get to work  now when are you going  to begin       i m going to begin monday   replied ernestine      good  painting some great picture      she hesitated   i hope it will be a great picture       tell me about it       i can tell you better  dear  when it is a little farther along       you love your work  ernestine  you have the real  true  fundamental love  for it  i always loved to see your face light up when you spoke of your  work  is your face lighted up now   he asked  a little whimsically  but  earnestly     she laughed  but the laugh caught in her throat      will you tell me about your picture as it progresses  dear  don t be  afraid to talk to me of your work  ernestine  things will be less hard  for me  if i think you are happy  and it will be good to know there is to  be some great thing come of our love  dear  i want something to stand for  it  something beautiful and great       there will be   she said passionately   there is going to be       i know   he said gently   i am sure of it      he stroked her face lovingly then  he loved so to do that      will you mind much  karl   she began  a little timidly   if i am away  from you some this year       away from me   he asked  startled   why  what do you mean  ernestine       oh  not that i am going away   she hastened   but  as i say  i am going  to begin my work on monday  and part of the time i shall be working  away  from home       you mean in some studio      her face grew troubled  she frowned a little  bit her lip  but after a  second s hesitation  answered   yes       found some fellow to study with      and again she answered yes      well now look here  liebchen  have i been such a brute that you thought  i wouldn t want you to set foot out of the house  i didn t suppose there  was anyone here you d have much to gain from  but if there is  so much  the better  i want you to go right ahead and do your best  don t you know  that      but there was a note of forced cheer in it  it would be hard for karl to  feel she was not in the house  when he had come to depend on her for so  many things  she could not tell him why she was willing to be away from  him  it hurt her to think he might feel she did not understand     a little later georgia and her mother and georgia s mr  tank came over to  see them  during the summer ernestine and karl had been bestowing an  approving interest on georgia and joseph tank  karl liked him  he said  the fellow laughed as though there was no reason why he shouldn t   he  doesn t know everything   he told ernestine   but knows too much to seem  to know what he doesn t      georgia had been disposed to be apologetic about mr  tank s paper bags   and karl had retorted   great scott  georgia  is there anything the world  needs much worse than paper bags      to night mr  tank was all enthusiasm about a ball game he had attended  that afternoon  he gave karl the story of the game in the picturesque  fashion of a man more eager to express what he wishes to say than to  guard the purity of his english   oh  it was hot stuff  clear through    he concluded   bully good game       it is sometimes almost impossible for me to tell what georgia and mr   tank are talking about   sighed mrs  mccormick   they use so many words  which are not in the dictionary  now when people confine themselves to  words which are in the dictionary  i am always able to ascertain their  meaning       i m long for saying a thing the way i can get it said   laughed tank    and i m long for this new spelling  i never could get next to the old  system  and now if they push this deal through  i can pat myself on the  back and say   good for you  old boy  you were just waiting for them to  start in right   it would be such a good one on the teachers who bumped  my head against the wall because i didn t begin pneumonia with a p and  every other minute run in an i or an e i had sense enough to know had no  business there at all  oh  i m long for taking a fall out of the old  spelling book       i do hope  karl   admonished mrs  mccormick   that you will use your  influence with scholars to see that the dictionary is let alone  it is  certainly a very profane and presumptuous thing to think of changing a  dictionary    turning to ernestine for approval      when i was a child   observed georgia   i had a sublime and  unquestioning faith in two things   the bible and the dictionary  the  bible was written by god and the dictionary by noah webster  and both  were to remain intact to the end of time  but the university of chicago  is re writing the bible  and  most any one who feels like it can take a  hand at the dictionary  so what is there left for a poor girl to believe  in       believe in the american dollar   said tank cheerfully   that s the  solidest thing i ve ever been up against      mrs  mccormick left them to call upon a friend who lived next door  karl  and mr  tank turned to frenzied finance  and georgia and ernestine  wandered away by themselves  ernestine surmised that georgia wanted to  talk to her      how goes it at  the mail    she asked      oh  so so   said georgia fretfully   newspaper work is a thankless job       why  georgia  i thought you loved it so       oh  yes   yes  in a way  i do  but it s thankless  and you never get  anywhere  you break your neck one day  and then there s nothing to do the  next  but start in and break it again  you re never any better to day for  yesterday s killing  now with you  when you paint a good picture  it  stays painted       why don t you get married   asked ernestine  innocently      married  pooh  that would be a nice thing       indeed it would  if you care for the man      georgia was fidgeting  it was plain she wanted to talk about marriage  if  she could do so without seeming to be vitally interested in the subject      i mean it  georgia   ernestine went on   if you care for him  marry  him       care for whom   georgia demanded  and then coloured and laughed at the  folly of her evasion   well  the fact of the matter is   she finally  blurted out   i don t know whether i do or not  now  in a way  i do  that  is  i want him to care for me  and i shouldn t like it if he sailed away  to the philippine islands and never showed up again  but at the same  time  well  i don t think even  you  could get up much sentiment about  paper bags  and besides   tempestuously   the name tank s preposterous      ernestine laughed   what are those terms the lawyers are so fond  of  immaterial  irrelevant  and something else  georgia  once when i was  a little girl and went to visit my grandmother  i had a stubborn fit and  wouldn t eat any dinner because the dining room table had such ugly legs   and the dinner  georgia  was good      it was georgia who laughed then   but ernestine   with a swift turn to  seriousness   you re not a fair sample  you and karl are  exceptional   you see you have so  much   intellectual companionship  sympathetic  ideas  kindred tastes  don t you see what a fool i d make of myself in  judging the thing by you    she ended with a little gulp which might have  been a laugh or might have been something else     ernestine was giving some affectionate rubs to her brass coffee pot  when  she raised her head it was to look at georgia strangely  she continued to  look  and the strangeness about her intensified   shall i tell you  something  georgia    her voice low and queer   something i  know   you  wouldn t be willing to fight  till you dropped for sympathetic ideas  you  wouldn t be willing to lay down your life for intellectual companionship   you wouldn t be willing to go barefoot and hungry and friendless for  kindred tastes  don t for one minute believe you would  the only thing  for which you d be willing to let the whole world slip away from you is  an old fashioned  out of date thing called love  just the primitive   fundamental love there is between a man and a woman  if you haven t it   georgia  hold back  if you have    a wonderful smile of understanding  glowed through a rush of tears   oh  georgia  if you  have             chapter xxvii      learning to be karl s eyes    she wondered many times in the next few months why she had put it in that  very simple  self evident way     for there are things harder than to go barefoot and hungry and  friendless  those are the primitive things  to be met with one s  endowment of primitive courage  elemental strength  but poise of spirit  can not be wrested from elemental courage  to carry one s carefully  wrapped up burden with the nonchalance of the day  nature forgot to make  endowment for that  it is something then to be worked out wholly by one s  self     persecution she could have endured like a spartan  but it was almost  unendurable to be tolerated  she was sure it would have been easier if  only they had been rude to her  to be openly jeered at would fire her  soul  but there was so little in their manner either to kindle enthusiasm  or stir aggressiveness  she began to think that the most trying thing in  the world was to have people polite to one     the very first week was the worst of all  no one knew what to do with  her  as this was her own idea  an idea no one else pretended to  understand  it was expected she make some suggestions for the proper  disposition of herself  but poor ernestine did not know enough about it  to make disposition of herself  she could only smile with a courageous  serenity  and ask that she be shown how to help about things  and so mr   willard  who was in charge of karl s laboratory  and who was karl without  karl s genius  turned her over to mr  beason  his assistant  beason would  show her how to  help      her sense of humour helped her there  it was amusing that one who was  learning to  help  should be such an encumbrance  and there were many  amusing things about mr  beason  he was afraid of her because she was a  woman  for like reason disapproving of her presence in the laboratory   and yet there was an unconscious deference  the same kind of veneration  he would have paid karl s old coat  or his pipe     john beason had never been shaken by a genuine emotion until the day he  read that dr  karl hubers had lost his eyesight and must give up his  work  in the horror  the rage and the grief which swept over him then   beason rose to the heights of a human being  never to be quite without  humanship again  when he came back that fall  professor hastings was  quick to sense the change     beason was given a place in dr  hubers  old laboratory  as one of mr   willard s assistants  that first morning  after he had been in there  about an hour  he came out to professor hastings  who chanced to be  alone      i don t know whether i want to stay in there or not   the boy jerked  out      he told him that dr  hubers would like to have him there   you know he  liked you   he said simply     beason sat a long time pondering   well  they ll never have another man  like him   he said at last  savagely  and choking a little     after the first few weeks his attitude toward ernestine took on a  complexity an analysis of which would have greatly astounded mr  beason  himself  he did a great deal of pondering as to whether it would really  be possible for dr  hubers to go on with his work  it seemed to him it  would not be  but a few things mrs  hubers had said in a very simple way  had opened up a great deal of speculation as to what was possible and  what was not  and the thing which made him grow so quickly into an  unconscious respect for her was her assumption that the most important  thing in the world was that dr  hubers should go on with his work  now  that looked as though she had some sense  beason admitted  of course the  ridiculous part was thinking  she  was the one to bring it about  when  anybody would know it would have to be some one  well  some one like  himself  but then it was just like a woman to think she could do anything  she took it into her head to do  of course she would very soon find out  that she couldn t  but if she proved some one else could  why then she  wouldn t be so bad  after all     ernestine was quick to see that the way to enlist mr  beason was to talk  to him about karl  they were alone in the laboratory for an hour each  morning  and during that period she always managed to say something about  dr  hubers to leave beason closer to her at the end of the hour than he  had been at the beginning  there were more ways than one of winning a  scientific victory  she concluded  half humorously  but with a touch of  sadness  she was beginning to see that it was a battle which demanded  tact and diplomacy quite as much as brains and skill  she must not only  furnish enthusiasm for herself  she must inspire all associated with her  if she were to gain from them what they had to give     it was after she had one day spoken with unusual freedom of the suffering  which surged beneath karl s calm acceptance of the inevitable that beason  took his first firm stand in her behalf      well now  of course   he conceded  after a long time of turning it over  in his mind   you really don t have to  know  much  do you  the great  thing for you to learn is to tell exactly how results look  it isn t as  if you had to reason and think    that was beason s supreme rise to  graciousness      why  you have the idea exactly  mr  beason   she replied  admiringly   and beason grasped that he had manifested rare insight      well now    doubtfully   i suppose you might practice on me  practice is  what you need  i haven t looked at any of those things over there  see if  you can give me an idea of what they are      she did her best  blundering freely  and thinking with an inward smile  that she had not counted on anything so difficult as translating things  to beason     then he took the tube from her hand and explained how she had failed to  get the significant things  and how valueless she would be unless she  made the determining points stand out  he was very blunt and  unflattering  but she was grateful to him from the bottom of her heart    you see you do have to have some brains after all   he concluded with a  sigh     but after that he frequently devoted his entire hour to helping her  he  had come to accept her as one of his duties  and beason was not one to  neglect his appointed task  day by day she gained a great deal from the  uncompromising mr  beason     in fact  after those first uncertain weeks  she gained a great deal from  every one  gradually it began to systematise itself  and ernestine s good  sense  her earnestness  which was fairly devotion  her respect for every  one s knowledge and gratitude for all help  to say nothing of her eyes  and smile and voice  slowly penetrated even the conservatism of science     dr  parkman did not neglect her  he came out often and spent an hour in  the laboratory  bringing things for her to work with  perhaps the doctor  saw that quite as much as his help  she needed the prestige his attention  would give  it was no small thing to have the great dr  parkman giving  her his time   upon my soul   mr  willard said one day  after the doctor  had been there a long time and had seemed very much in earnest   i don t  believe parkman s the man to spend his time on a wild goose chase       it doesn t seem so  does it   said professor hastings ingenuously      why  think what that man s time is worth   continued mr  willard   growing more and more impressed      i don t know any one else out here who would get much of it   professor  hastings ventured      well  she is a remarkable woman   willard said then  insistently     and professor hastings  understanding many things about human  beings  said he was really coming to feel that way himself     ernestine was alone in the laboratory one bright morning in december  mr   beason had just gone away after assuring her anew that she had a very  great deal to learn  perhaps it was funny  but one was not always in the  mood for humorous things  sometimes one felt more like putting one s head  down on the table and having a good cry  her hands were not quite steady   as she went about the work beason had patronisingly left for her to do   and out of the mists which blinded her there came a picture of her own  quiet studio at home  where she had worked with her own things  things  with which she was supreme  she saw herself at her easel  working in that  quick  sure way of hers  no one to tell her some one else could do it a  great deal better  and that it was extremely doubtful whether she could  ever do anything at all  a longing to be back there doing the things she  knew she could do  a longing to have again that sure sense of her work as  good  swept over her then  she was accustomed to a sense of mastery  it  was that made some of these things so hard  it was not easy to make over  one s soul  even when it was love called one on  as she went steadily  ahead with her task  working out painstakingly the correction beason had  made  she wondered whether there were as many tears back of other smiles  as there had often been back of hers     but she had been able to smile   that was something for which to give  thanks  not even karl himself would ever know what she had gone through   but what she had gone through was of small consequence could she but push  her way on to what she was confident awaited her  there was sustaining  power in that thought  her hands did not tremble now  her eyes were  clear  she worked on steadily and firmly     one thing which had unnerved her was that karl had seemed to hate to have  her go away that morning  he had followed her out into the hall   working  so hard  liebchen   he said  and was it not wistfully  perhaps he had not  felt like work himself and had wanted her to stay at home with him  it  hurt cruelly to think karl might not understand her willingness to be  away from him so much     his presence was always with her in the laboratory  the days brought a  very clear picture of karl at work there  a new understanding of his  adjustment to his work  firmer comprehension of his love for it  often a  sense of the terribleness and wrongness of his disaster would rush over  her  crowding her heart with the old rebellion and bitterness  again and  again she lived through the hour karl had spent there alone  facing the  truth  and then a horror of those things with which she worked  those  awful things which had destroyed karl s eyes  would take hold of her as a  physical fear  a repulsion  almost impossible to fight     she was constantly brought to see the difference between him and these  other men  every hour she spent there brought deeper appreciation of  karl s greatness  clearer sense of it  and when their kindly patronage  sometimes passed from the amusing to the insufferable  she would think  how karl  master of them all  took her so unreservedly into his mind and  heart  cherishing her ideas and opinions as quite the most vital things  in all the world  and sometimes that would help her to smile  and not  infrequently it made her long to hurl a test tube at the self satisfied  head of mr  beason  but always  in the end  it caused her to set her  whole being with new persistence  more passionate stubbornness  in this  determination to achieve     it was while she was still alone that professor hastings came in with a  note he had just received for her   it s from dr  parkman   she said as  she tore it open hastily     she read a little of it and then sat down  he thought for a moment that  she was going to cry      dr  parkman wants me to come down to one of his operations this  afternoon    she looked up at him appealingly   i  i never went to  anything like that   she added  with a tremulous laugh      what does he say about it   he asked  anxiously      merely  merely that it will be a good cancer operation  and that i had  better begin on that part of the work  he says he would be willing to do  that  but he thinks it will help me to be able to make some of the  observations for dr  hubers myself  i  well  it sometimes makes me sick  to see things i don t like    laughing a little  and plainly unnerved      oh  no   he assured her   it will not be that bad   but he added   uneasily   dr  parkman seems anxious for you to come       no  not particularly anxious  he simply tells me to be there at two  o clock       i suppose then you d better go   he laughed   you won t mind much  you  may to day  but you ll become accustomed to it very soon  and it is  important  some one else might do it  but it will help your own  understanding of the subject  make your equipment that much better  it s  a great thing for you to have dr  parkman s help  and he is so pleased  with your progress  he told me the other day that he thought it  absolutely phenomenal the way you were getting on       did he   she asked eagerly  for she had learned to seize upon all which  would buoy her up      we all think so   he replied earnestly   even mr  willard  who  as you  may have observed  is not an enthusiast  said the other day that you were  becoming really useful      she brightened  and then laughed  she had never supposed she would be  inordinately pleased to have a man like mr  willard say she was really  useful      while mr  beason went so far as to assert that you had a general  intelligence not unlike that of a man      she laughed heartily at that   well  i m afraid they won t think i have  the nerve or sense of a man when i get in the operating room this  afternoon   she said with a wry little face      well  remember what it s all for   he said  in that simple way of his  which went so far because it was so direct   and remember that we are all  believing in you      in response to that she went back to her work with new resolution     it was a little before two when her lagging footsteps brought her in  sight of the hospital   why  i act as though i were going to my own  execution   she told herself scornfully  ever since receiving the note   she had been trying not to think about what was before her  but it was  here now  a fact to be faced  conquering an impulse to turn about and  beat a hasty retreat  she advanced with a brisk and business like air she  was sure would deceive the most knowing of hospital attendants     they seemed to know about her in the office  and took her up to one of  the rooms adjoining the operating room  the hospital was a very large  place  and there were a great many odours she did not like  she hated  herself for being so silly about things  through the open door she saw  many faces  white faces  thin faces  faces drawn with pain  faces robbed  of hope  faces fretful  and faces indifferent  and she caught sight of  one girl whose very happy eyes looked out from a face which bore the  record of much pain  a story easy to read  she had been very ill  but now  she was getting well  and how calm and well ordered a place it was    strange how they could keep so unruffled a surface over so turbulent a  sea     a nurse upstairs said that dr  parkman had told her to look after mrs   hubers  she dressed her in a white gown and talked to her pleasantly  about operations in general  ernestine was glad that this very rational  being did not know how hard she was struggling to keep her teeth from  chattering     in a minute  dr  parkman himself came in  he  too  in white gown  ready  for the operation  he looked so strange  to her nervous vision   supernatural  a being from other worlds  holding the destiny of this one  in those strong  supple  incisive fingers   i don t suppose you ll enjoy  this much   he said   but you d better get used to them  karl may need  you to do some of this for him  and you wouldn t like it not to be able  to       no  indeed   she replied  heartily  very heartily   i m so glad to  come      he looked at her in his keen  deep seeing way  she had an uncomfortable  sense that he had a distinct impulse toward a smile      hughes  one of our young doctors  will point out a few things to you as  we go along  and i ll go over it with you afterwards      then they went into the operating room     she fought hard against the smell of ether  and managed to hold herself  quite firm against it  but there was a ghastliness in the whole thing  which frightened her     the patient was lying there on the operating table  covered with sheets   looking as if dead  it was a woman who was to be operated on  and  ernestine could not overcome the idea that it was a dreadful thing for  her to be there alone  surrounded by strange people who were acting in so  unconcerned a manner  they did not seem to be thinking in the least of  what life and death meant to this woman  one young doctor was showing  something to another  and they laughed right out loud  the woman whose  life was at stake was not impressing them any more than  not any more  than that terrible looking little instrument which the nurse handed to  dr  parkman     her dizzy vision got dr  parkman s face as he leaned over his patient   she had never seen such a look of concentration  he did not know anything  in the world then save the thing he was doing  and the concentration was  enveloped in so tremendous a coolness  but her own face must have warned  the nurse who was looking after her  for she whispered   suppose you come  over here by the window until they have started  there is no need for you  to watch while they are making the incision      so she stood there with her back to them  looking out at a little park  across from the hospital  down there  men and women were moving about  quite as usual  one girl was laughing very heartily about something   strange that people should be laughing      now you might come over here   said the nurse  as pleasantly and easily  as though saying   wouldn t you like a cup of tea      she tried then with all her might to take it as the rest of them were  taking it  but they were operating on the stomach  and her first glimpse  caused an almost uncontrollable sinking in the knees  her ears began to  pound  but by listening very hard she could hear what dr  hughes was  saying  he was saying something about its being a very nice case  and she  wondered if the woman were married  and if she had any children  and then  she knew how irrelevant and unprofessional that was  dr  hughes was  telling her to look at something  and she did look  and she saw dr   parkman s hands  only it seemed they were not human hands at all   but some infallible instrument  an instrument with an unconquerable  soul   and then everything was dancing before her eyes  her ears were  pounding harder and harder  her knees sinking  everything swaying  some  one had hold of her  and some one else  a great many miles away was  saying   take her out      when she opened her eyes  she was lying on a couch in an anteroom  the  nurse bending over her  the attendant smiled pleasantly  no more agitated  than before   too bad   she said   a good many of us take it like that at  first      but ernestine was not to be comforted  it meant too much to her  the  tears were running down her face  but suddenly she brushed them angrily  aside  and sat up   i m going back   she said resolutely      oh  but you mustn t   protested the nurse    not today  it really  wouldn t do  and anyway they must be almost through  dr  parkman works so  rapidly      it was a very disheartened ernestine who sat there then alone   what will  dr  parkman think of me   she bewailed to herself   he will never want to  have anything more to do with me  he will be so disgusted that he will  let me alone now  and how am i to get along without him  oh   why  am i  such a fool      the whole day had been hard  she was tired out when she came  and this  was too much  so she just lay back on the couch and cried  it was so that  dr  parkman found her when he came briskly in at the close of the  operation      why  what s the matter   he demanded   heard some bad news        bad   news   she choked out   no  i haven t heard any bad news  except  that i m an utterly worthless  weak minded fool       and where did you hear that   he pursued      oh  doctor  i m so ashamed  but if you ll only give me another chance   if you ll just not give me up for a little while yet       give you up  now what kind of reviving fluid did miss lewis produce for  you  what in the world are you talking about  do you think you re any  grand exception in not seeing your first operation through  hum  ask some  of these nurses around here  some of the doctors too  only they won t  tell the truth  my first day in the dissecting room was a day of about  thirty minutes  so you see you have plenty of company in your  weak mindedness      she brightened then to the extent of looking willing to be comforted    but it s humiliating  doctor  to think you re going to accomplish some  big thing and then be absolutely overcome by a little incidental thing  that doesn t happen to appeal to your senses  it s awful to have your  senses get ahead of your soul like that   she laughed      hum    dr  parkman had a  hum  all his own   there s nothing unique in  that experience  either  the spirit is willing  but the stomach is  weak  to put it in exact terms  as a matter of fact  that s what life is  made up of  having great purposes overthrown by minor inconveniences   many a man can get hold of a great idea  but very few of them can stick  by it through the things that make them uncomfortable  that s the reason  most dreamers fail  they re not willing to come down out of the clouds  and get to work at things that turn their stomachs       well  i m not like that   she flashed back at him      you  i know you re not  some ancestor of yours gave you a big bump of  stubbornness  for which you should look back to him with gratitude   stubborn people aren t easily put out of the race  now i ll tell you why  i wanted you to come down here   he went on  more seriously   i want you  to see the thing just as it is  i want you to get the conception of it as  a whole  i don t want you to become short sighted  some people look so  much through the microscope that they forget how to look any other way   that s the difference between karl and some of those fellows you re  associated with now  that willard and lane and young beason are the  scientific kind  too abominably scientific to forge ahead  don t lose  sight of what you are doing  all these things you are doing now are  simply a means to an end  you are to be one of the instruments  employed  as you put it yourself one day  but make yourself such a  highly organised  responsive instrument that you re fairly alive with the  idea yourself  see  that s where your real value will come in  you  know    it was dr  parkman now who breathed the enthusiasm which draws  one to a light out beyond obstacle and difficulty   i m beginning to see  the thing more and more as actual fact  i caught the idea from the first   and then it seemed it simply had to be done because it was such a great  thing to do  but i m getting it more and more now just as a practical   matter of fact thing  and it isn t so far away   not so very  you see   after all  mrs  hubers  you don t have to do it all  it would be stupid  to set a race horse at a job that could be just as well accomplished by a  plug  any well trained man can do certain things for karl  but it s the  touch of the artist  the things that make it real  it s making the blind  man see  doing the impossible   that s your work  why  i can fairly see  the whole thing   he went on   karl and you and some good assistant   he ll get both points of view then  he can t miss anything  the other  fellow can give him certain technicalities you might miss  and then  you ll turn in and bring it to his vision  a clear statement of facts  could never make a blind man see  and then it will be your business to  keep the spirit right  that s the real point  after all  why  i can see  it just as clearly as i could see that work to be done in there      pointing to the operating room     it was another ernestine now  she rose to it as the warrior to the  trumpet call  he knew that the right word had been said      now i don t think it will hurt you to see some of these operations   he  went on  in more business like way   not only to help with observations  for karl  but  well  just to see it for yourself  nothing will make this  quite so real and vital to you as to see it actually breaking down human  organisms  destroying life  i want you to get an eye for the thing as a  whole   see it as it is now  see the need of making it some other way   you must have more than a desire to help karl  you must have an  enthusiasm for the thing itself  you ll get so then that when you see an  operation like this you won t see just some broken down  diseased tissue  that makes you feel weak kneed  but you ll see something to get in and  fight  oh  it s a battle  so get your fighting blood up  remember that  you ll have to have enough for two  you know  what you must do for karl  is not only give him back the weapons with which to fight  but you must  rouse his soldier s blood   see what i mean      it was a joy to watch the response  he could see weariness and  discouragement slipping from her as she spoke     he was thinking to himself that she was superb  but aloud he said   this  is a good specimen in here  if you ll just come into the next room i d  like to go over it with you  i think i can make a few things clear      she was radiant then  happy that he had so soon forgotten her first  failure  appreciating his assumption that she was ready even now to go on  with the fight      she will carry it through   thought dr  parkman  as he finally left the  hospital   and  by the good lord  i believe that karl hubers is going to  get back in the game and win  nasty blow to the woman haters   he mused   as he looked in upon an office full of waiting patients    a very nasty  blow            chapter xxviii      with broken sword    he wished that ernestine would come home  he had let ross go at four  and  it was lonesome there alone  in spite of the fact that she was away so  much  ernestine was almost always there when he wanted her most  that was  just one of the wonderful things about ernestine  something must have  detained her to day     he reached over on the table for his copy of  faust   it had become his  habit to pick it up when he did not care to sit face to face with his own  thoughts  it seemed to hold some word for everything in life  its  universality made it a good friend     it was becoming easier to read with his fingers  but he had never come  into the old joy in reading that there had been in the days when he could   see  it  and it seemed to him that there was an unnecessary clumsiness  about the whole thing  he had worked out a little idea of his own for  which he was going to have a model made  he believed it might help  some  at any rate he had enjoyed working it out   if a fellow feels like  inventing  he simply must invent something  whether it amounts to  anything or not   he had explained to ernestine     he did not read consecutively to night  but just a line here and there   getting a little of wit  a little of philosophy  a dash or two of  sarcasm  an occasional gleam of sentiment  he liked to take it that way  at times like this  it seemed if not one thing  then surely another  must  keep him from the things into which it would be so easy to slip to night      restless activity proves the man    several times his fingers went over  that  and his responsive face told that to his mind it brought a poignant  meaning  and to his heart an understanding and a sadness  he closed the  book  and sat there thinking  he seemed very self contained  quiet   poised  but the understanding eye would have known that he was thinking  deep thoughts  facing hard truths     once at a horse race he had seen a horse which had just been lamed tied  near the track  it heard the ringing of the gong  heard the music of the  other horses  feet  heard  saw  smelled  sensed in every way the race  that was going on  a weakness in one foot could not kill the spirit of a  race horse  tied there beside the track  watching others struggling for  the race  he had wondered about that horse  then  had been sure from the  quivering of its nostrils  the pawing of its foot  the passionate  trembling of its whole superb body that it suffered  thinking back to it  to night he had good reason to know that he had been right that day     it was queer about life  in some ways so incomprehensively great and  superb  and yet so easy to be overthrown  great purposes seemed very  great  but was a thing really great when it was so easily undermined  was  there not a dizzying instability about it all     he smiled a little as he lighted his pipe  he seemed to be doing a great  deal of speculating these days  what if he too were to be graduated into  the bigger field of philosophy  but he shook his head  still smiling a  little  if he ever entered the bigger field of philosophy he was sure he  would not be carried there in other men s elevators  that he would not  arrive in the jaunty  well groomed state of ross and his sort  no  if he  ever found the bigger field of philosophy  it would be after he had  scaled slippery crags and forded great rivers  after he had pushed his  way through brambles and across sharp stones  after he had many times  lost his footing  and had many times stopped to rest  believing he could  go no farther  it was after some such quest that he might perhaps find  his way up into the bigger field of philosophy  but he would not find  ross there  ross and his fellows were down in a nice little garden that  had been fixed up for them  that was it  the garden of philosophy   a  garden made by man  in which there were little artificial lakes and  shrubbery set out in attractive designs  a very nice garden indeed  where  the sun shone and where it was true pretty flowers would grow  but ah   one did not feel the wind upon one s face down in that sheltered garden  as he believed one would feel it up there on the lonely heights to which  one had climbed alone  and the garden of philosophy  he was smiling at  his fancy  but it interested him  was electric lighted  while up there on  the big wide sweep  one came very close to the stars     what was philosophy  anyway  with ross it seemed a matter of speaking the  vocabulary of philosophers  it was so  he knew  with many men  and yet   as to the thing itself  it was not a mere learning a system of thought   acquiring the easy use of a peculiar kind of words  it was not fair   after all  to judge a thing by the people least fitted to understand it   perhaps philosophy was conquering life  perhaps it was learning to take  life in good part  making up one s mind to write good text books if it  seemed certain the writing of text books were to be one s part  perhaps  it was just holding one s place  the mere thing of holding one s place  seemed a bigger thing now than it once had  he wondered  he was wondering  about many things these days  and perhaps he had already scaled a crag or  two  for he was able sometimes  in spite of the deep sadness of his face   to smile a little in his wonderings     ernestine was her sweetest self when she came in a little later   i m  glad you were late   he said  after her affectionate protestations  regarding her shortcomings   you haven t been this nice for a long time      she threw aside her hat and coat and took her favourite place on the low  seat beside him   don t you remember  liebchen  how it was over there in  europe  after you d treated me badly  you were always so nice  that i  used to be quite tempted to make you be horrid       i never was horrid to you   she protested      you re never horrid any more   he said  and  strangely enough  he said  it sadly      well  do you  want  me to be       yes  i wish you d turn in once in a while and call me an old brute  and  say you wished you d never seen me  and didn t know how in heaven s name  you were going to go on living with me       karl   she gasped   are you going  crazy        no  at least i hope not  but you re just nice to me all the time   because  because i m blind  i don t like it  i wish you d  swear  at me  sometimes       well  in the first place   laughing  but serious too   it had come so  heatedly   it isn t my way to swear at any one  i never did swear at you   why should i begin now       oh  swear was figurative language   he laughed      and of all things for a man to harrow up his soul about  not liking it  because his wife is never horrid to him       it s not as crazy as it sounds  are you and i a couple of plaster  saints  well  hardly  then why don t we have any quarrels  it s just  because you re sorry for me  i ll not have you being sorry for me   he  concluded  almost angrily     but when she kissed him  he could not resist a smile   you don t know  much  do you  karl  don t you know that we don t quarrel about little  things  because we ve had so many big things on hand  we don t swear at  each other  because        because we have so many other things to swear at   he finished for her      that s it  all our fighting emotion is being used up       oh  you re such a genius for making things seem right  now looking at it  that way  i m quite reconciled to your being nice to me  still i want you  to promise that if you ever feel like swearing  you will       i promise   she responded solemnly      don t do things  or not do things  because you re sorry for me   ernestine       we are  sorry for  people who are unequal to things  i m sorry with you   not for you  karl       ernestine    with an affectionate little laugh   is there  anything  you  don t understand       you might play a little for me   he said after a silence   play that  thing that ends in a question       of liszt s       yes  the one that leaves you wondering      at first she had resented bitterly her not being able to play more  satisfyingly  if only music were her work  it seemed an almost malicious  touch that fate  in taking away karl s own work  had also shut him out  from hers  resentment at that had made it hard for her to play for him at  all  at first  but she had overcome that  and had been able to make music  mean much to them both  they loved especially the music which seemed to  translate for them things within their own hearts     but to night when ernestine had left him pondering a minute the question  he said liszt always left with him  she turned  eagerly it seemed  to  lighter things  she played a little nevin  played it with a lightness   gladsomeness  he had never felt in her touch before  he said nevin helped  him to see things  that he could see leaves moving on their branches   could see the shadows falling on the hillsides where the cattle were  grazing  as he listened to nevin  but it did not bring the pictures  to night  it opened up new fears      ernestine   he said abruptly   come here       are you ever frightened  ernestine   he asked of her  still in that  abrupt  strange manner      frightened  about what       frightened about having to live all your life with me      for a moment she did not answer  then  her voice quiet with the quiet  that would hold back anger   karl  do you think you are treating me very  kindly to night  saying these strange things i cannot understand       but  ernestine  look here  you re young  beautiful  love life  doesn t  it ever occur to you that you re not getting enough fun out of things       karl    and there was a quivering in the voice now   do you think i have  been thinking lately about  getting fun out of things        no  but that s just it  you  ought  to be thinking about it   ernestine   think  of it  how are you going to go on forever loving a  blind man      for answer  she knelt down beside him  her arms about his neck  her cheek  against his      yes  i know  in that way  but in the old way of the first days  i was so  different then  how  can  you love me now  the way you did then  what do  i do now but sit in a chair and try to be patient  look at a man like  parkman  that s life  ernestine   drawing her close  a sob in his  voice   liebchen    can  you      she longed to tell him then  it would mean so much to tell him now   karl  was so troubled to night  but the time was not ripe yet  she must not  spoil it all  and so instead she talked to him of how real power  comprehended more than activity  how depth of understanding  great things  of the soul  were more masterful than those outer forces men called   life   ernestine seldom failed in being convincing when she felt things  as she now felt this      you always have the right word   he said at last   you can always get  ahead of the little blue devils       oh  karl   she murmured  very low  her heart too full to resist  this   some day i can show you better what i expect of life       of course   he mused  after a silence   you have your work       yes   replied ernestine  and something in her voice puzzled him   i have  my work      he would have been startled could he have seen her face just then  for  ernestine was so happy to night  she had come away from the hospital with  a song in her heart  a song of resolution and of triumph  she had never  foreseen the future so clearly  the time had never seemed so close at  hand  it had never been this real before  just in front of her as she sat  there beside karl was the gloria victis  that statue for which he had  cared so little at first  but which in these later days she often found  him dwelling upon with his hands in lingering touch of appreciation  to  her the statue had come to hold many meanings  she looked at it now with  shining eyes  karl had held so tight to the broken sword  how splendid  then that he should win the fight despite it all     and she felt she had never risen so completely to the idea of karl s  greatness as she did to day  what was there in the afternoon had meant so  much to her  was it actually seeing things as they were  or was it the  things dr  parkman had said to point the way anew  there was to night a  new tide of appreciation  a larger understanding  more passionate  response to this thought of karl as greatest of them all  looking at  his face as he sat there in deep thought  she saw the marks of his  greatness upon it just as plainly as she saw those other marks of his  suffering   this man stop work  such as he out of the race     she remembered the letters they had received when the news of his  blindness had gone out  she had wept over them many times  but it seemed  she had never grasped their significance before  they were from men of  science  from doctors  from students  and from many plain people unknown  outside their small communities  who wrote to say they were sorry  they  had seen about him once or twice in the magazines  they said  or perhaps  their own doctor at home had told them of him  and they were so  interested because their wife or husband or mother had died of cancer   and they knew what an awful thing it was  it should have been some one  whom the world needed less than it needed him  these plain people said     her eyes filled with a rush of tears  this was her karl  he with whom all  the world grieved  she recalled the editorials in the scientific papers   telling of the things he had done  the things it had been believed by  them all he would achieve  this was her karl   this man whose withdrawal  from active participation had been told of by great scientists everywhere  as a world wide calamity  how quiet and unassuming and simple he had been  about it all  he whose stepping out had been felt around the world     and  now  some day before long she would come to him with   karl  i have  found a new way of fighting with broken swords  take a good grip on the  sword  a good strong grip  and let us turn back to the fight      she turned to him with that quick passionateness he loved in her so well    i love you   she said  and though she had said it many times in other  days  it had never sounded just like that before           chapter xxix      unpainted masterpieces    georgia was to be married  it was the week before christmas  and on the  last day of the year she would become mrs  joseph tank  she had told joe  that if they were to be married at all they might as well get it over  with this year  and still there was no need of being married any earlier  in the year than was necessary  she assured him that she married him  simply because she was tired of having paper bags waved before her eyes  everywhere she went  and she thought if she were once officially  associated with him people would not flaunt his idiosyncrasies at her  that way  and then ernestine approved of getting married  and ernestine s  ideas were usually good  to all of which joe responded that she certainly  had a splendid head to figure it out that way  joe said that to his mind  reasons for doing things weren t very important anyhow  it was doing them  that counted     yesterday had been her last day on the paper  she had felt queer about  that thing of taking her last assignment  though it was hard to reach  just the proper state  for the last story related to pork packers  and  pork packing is not a setting favourable to sentimental regrets  it was  just like the newspaper business not even to allow one a little  sentimental harrowing over one s exodus from it  but the time for gentle  melancholy came later on  when she was sorting her things at her desk  just before leaving  and was wondering what girl would have that old  desk  if they cared to risk another girl  and whether the other poor girl  would slave through the years she should have been frivolous  only to  have some man step in at the end and induce her to surrender the things  she had gained through sacrifice and toil  as she wrote a final letter on  her typewriter  she did hate letting the old machine go  georgia did  considerable philosophising about the irony of working for things only to  the end of giving them up  she had waded through snowdrifts and been  drenched in pouring rains  she had been frozen with the cold and  prostrated with the heat  she had been blown about by chicago wind until  it was strange there was any of her left in one piece  she had had front  doors  yes  and back doors too  slammed in her face  she had been the  butt of the alleged wit of menials and hirelings  she had been patronised  by vapid women as the poor girl who must make her living some way  she  had been roasted by  but never mind  she had had a beat or two  and now  she was to wind it all up by marrying joseph tank  who had made a great  deal of money out of the manufacture of paper bags  this from her  who  had always believed she would end her days in new york  or perhaps write  a realistic novel exposing some mighty evil      ah  well  it s all in the day s work    she had been saying that to  herself as she covered her typewriter  and then  just as she was fearing  that her exit would be a maudlin one  joe called up to say that he did  not think it would be too cold for the machine  and why not spin out  somewhere on the north shore for a good dinner  now that had been nice of  joe  for it tided her over the good byes     to day she was engaged in the pre nuptial rite of destroying her past   indulging in the letter destroying ceremonial which seems always to  attend the eve of matrimony  it was so that ernestine found her when she  stopped on her way from the university that afternoon     mrs  mccormick was sewing yards upon yards of lace on something when  ernestine came in   she s right in there   she said  referring to georgia  in a sepulchral tone which might fittingly have been employed for   the  remains have been laid out in the front room      georgia herself  though not sepulchral  was subdued   my  but i m glad  you ve come   she said  brushing aside several hundred letters that  ernestine might have a place to sit down   i m having the most terrible  twinge of conscience       why  what about      georgia pointed to the clock   think of my not being at the office  i  ought to be hanging around now for an afternoon assignment       you ll get over that   ernestine assured her  cheerfully      oh  i suppose so  one gets over everything  even being alive  meanwhile   behold me    with a great sweep of her arms   surrounded by my blighting  past       that one looks like freddie allen s writing   said ernestine  giving an  envelope at her foot a little shove      it is   said georgia  with feeling   yes  it is  poor freddie  he was  such a nice boy       i suppose he s nice still   observed ernestine      oh  i suppose so  i m sure i don t know  he s way back there in the dim  past       well  do you want him up here in the sunny present   ernestine inquired   much entertained      no  oh no  if i had wanted him i would have had him   with which  reversion to the normal georgia they laughed understandingly     she shook herself free of the dust of her past then  piled up the pillows  and settled herself on the bed   but we had some good times back there in  the dim past  didn t we  ernestine       some of them were good times   replied ernestine  a little soberly      of course our college life would have been happier if we had been able  to pull down that sophomore flag  i ve always thought jack stewart might  have done a little better with that  but as long as we kept jim jones  away from every party in his junior year  perhaps we should be  satisfied   georgia sighed heavily   and it is a joy to think back to  your telling the dean he didn t have the courage of his convictions when  he let them fire stone for heresy  oh there are a good many things to be  thankful for  you always had lots of nerve when it came to a show down   you looked so lady like  and yet you really weren t at all       well  i don t know whether i like that or not       i mean not so lady like that it interfered with anything you wanted to  do  you d speak up in the pleasantest  most agreeable voice and say the  most dreadful things  i ll never forget the day you told  prof  moore in  class that you had always had a peculiar aversion to the pilgrim  fathers       i always did   ernestine said fervently      then one day when we had spent an hour trying to tell what shakespeare  meant by some line you said you thought quite likely he put it in just  because there had to be another line  and  prof  jennings conditioned you  on the whole year s work  remember       i have reason to   laughed ernestine      the funny part of it was that you never seemed to think you were saying  anything startling  like the day you contended in ethics that you thought  frequently it was better to be pleasant than truthful  kitty janeway was  so shocked at that  i wonder if kitty janeway is any happier with her  second husband than she was with her first       i m sure i don t know   said ernestine in a rather far away voice      i ll send all the girls cards   said georgia  and again she sighed  heavily   the cards are going to look very nice   she added  a little  more hopefully      ernestine    after a little pause      yes       you and i are hanging right over the ragged edge of thirty       horrors   georgia  is this your idea of furnishing pleasant  entertainment for a guest       but i was just thinking how many things have happened to us since we  were twenty two       i was thinking of that a minute ago myself       to you  especially  now  i never supposed when we were in college that  you were going to marry karl hubers       no   laughed ernestine   neither did i       i mean i never associated you two with one another  and now i can t  think of you separately  and then your father and mother  and then karl  losing  heavens  but i m cheerful  now  isn t it just like me   she  demanded  angrily   to act like a fool just because i m going to be  married  if i keep on i ll find myself weeping because socrates is dead   and i never do weep  either  i tell you that joe tank s a terrible man    she laughed  brushing away some tears      i don t think you re going to have much to weep about  georgia  i know  you re going to be happy       well  if i m not it won t be joe s fault  unless it is his fault on  account of its  not  being his fault  what i mean is that good natured  people are sometimes aggravating       oh he ll not always be good natured   she reassured her     ernestine said then that she must go  and was standing at the door when  georgia burst forth   oh ernestine  i m so glad i remembered  you really  must go down to the art institute and see those pictures by that  norwegian artist  i shouldn t dream of pronouncing his name  they go away  this week  and it would be awful for you to miss them      a wistfulness  fairly pain  revealed itself for an instant in ernestine s  face  and then  as if coming into consciousness of the look   i know    she said briefly   i read about them  i ve been  thinking about it  i did  see some of them in europe  but of course i should love to see them  again       i wish you would  my dear  perhaps   a little fearfully   they d  make you feel like getting to work yourself  ernestine    gathering  courage   it s awful for you to let your work go this way  every one  says so  i was talking to ryan the other day  you know who he is  he  asked all about you  and if you were doing anything now  and when i told  him i was afraid not he fairly flew into a rage  said that was just the  way  the people who might be great didn t seem to have sense enough to  care to be      that brought the quick colour   perhaps mr  ryan does not understand  everything in life   she said  coolly      now  ernestine  he was lovely about you  would he have shown any feeling  at all if he didn t care a great deal for your work  does any one fly  into a rage at  my  not painting  he said you were  one  american woman  who was an artist instead of  a woman who paints   it seems he saw the  salon picture  oh  he said beautiful things about you      ernestine did not answer  she was standing there very quietly  her hand  on the knob   now  ernestine   georgia went on  after the manner of one  bound to have it out   i ve tried all winter to cultivate repression  i  don t know what it is you are trying to do over there in the laboratory   you asked me to do two things  not to ask you about it  and not to  mention it to karl  i haven t done either  but i want to tell you right  now if you have any idea of giving up your own work i think it s time for  your friends to inquire into your mental workings  the very fact you  don t want karl to know about it shows you know very well  he  won t  think it s right  anything that relates to his work can be done by people  who do that kind of work a great deal better than you can  really   ernestine  the thing is positively fanatical  and anyway    this with the  air of delivering the overpowering   i don t think it is at all nice the  way you are taking other men into your confidence and deceiving karl      she met that with a little laugh   dear me  what laudable sentiment  i ve  always heard there was no one half so proper as the girl about to be  married  never mind  georgia    a little more seriously  a little as if  it would not be hard to cry   karl will forgive me  some day       but  ernestine  i want you to work  can t you see how awful it is for  you not to  express yourself       i am going to express myself   she answered  lightly enough  but after  she had gone georgia wondered just what she had meant by that     she decided  when she came out of the apartment building  that she would  take a little walk  it was just cold enough to be exhilarating  and she  felt the need of something bracing  she was wishing as she walked along  very fast  responding to the keen  good air  that karl were with her now   karl did not exercise enough  and when he did yield to her supplications  and go for a walk with her he did not seem to enjoy it as she wished he  might   after a while  liebchen   he would say   i ll be more accustomed  to things after a while  and meanwhile there s plenty of fresh air right  here in our back yard    but it isn t just getting the fresh air   she  would protest   it s enjoying it while you re getting it     wait till  spring comes   he would sometimes answer   i m going to get out more  then      when she saw she was near one of the stations of the illinois central she  stopped  a little confused  could it be she had meant all the time to  come here  looking to the south  she saw that at the next station  not  three blocks away  the train which would take her to the city in ten  minutes was just arriving  the art institute was only two blocks from the  van buren street station   those facts associated themselves quickly in  her mind  she looked at her watch  not quite three  karl had said he  would be busy with mr  ross until five  she stood there in hesitation   she had seen no pictures since  oh it was too long ago to remember  what  harm could it do her  and anyway  this with something of the uprising of  the truant child  it was christmas time  every one else was taking a  vacation  why  but here it was all swept into the imperative  consciousness that she had no time to lose  and she was at the ticket  window before she was quite sure that she had made up her mind     it was all so strange then  exhilaration mounted high for a little while   but there followed a very tense excitement  she tried to laugh at  herself  contend that she was coming for enjoyment  relaxation  that it  was absurd to go to pieces this way  but things long suppressed called  for their own  and the man to whom she gave her admission fee wondered  for a long time after she had passed him just what it was about her  seemed so strange     how good it was  how good to be back among her own kind of things  in the  laboratory every one knew more than she did  there she was repressed   humble even  gratefully accepting the crumbs of knowledge falling from  their tables  it was good to feel for a little while that she was some  place where she knew a great deal about things  she wished mr  willard or  mr  beason would happen along that she might give them some insight into  the colossalness of their ignorance     she turned down the corridor leading to the room where she would find the  special exhibit  she stopped before many of the pictures  reverting to  that joy of the spirit in dominance  there was exultation  almost  rapture  in this quick  firm rush of understanding  deep joy in just  knowing the good from the bad     but when she reached the pictures she had come to see it was different   she walked to the middle of the room  and in one slow sweep of glance   punctuated with long pauses  took them in  and she responded to them with  a warm  glad rush of tears     they fell upon her artist s soul as the very lovely rain upon the thirsty  meadow  they drew her to them as the mother the homesick child  and like  the homesick child  back at last after weary days  she knew only that she  had come home  in this first overflowing moment there was no thought of  colour  brush work  this or that triumphant audacity  it was a coming to  her own  a home coming of the spirit  the heart s passionate  thankfulness  the heart s response     a few minutes of reverent pause  a high delight  deep response  and  then  the inevitable  clear as a bell upon the midnight air was that call  from soul to kindred soul  assurance and longing and demand possessed her  beyond all power to stay  the work she stood before now called to her as  naturally and inevitably as the bird to its mate  as undeniably as the  sea to the river  as potently as spring calls upon earth for its own  as  autumn calls to summer for harvest time     it frightened her  it seemed something within her over which she had no  control  it surged through her as far beyond all reason as the tides of  the sea are beyond the hand of man  it was procreative power demanding  fulfillment as the child ready for birth demands that it be born     she was conscious of some one s having come into the room  that her face  might not be seen she turned away and sat down before one of the  pictures  she was quivering so passionately that it seemed almost  impossible to hold herself within command     the girl who had come in was moving restlessly from one picture to  another  at last she walked over and sat down on the seat by ernestine      i think i like this one best   she said  abruptly  nodding to the  picture before them     ernestine nodded in reply  she was not sure what would happen were she to  speak  the girl she supposed to be one of the students there      i would give anything in the world  just anything in the world  if i  could do it too      at the passion of that she turned quickly and looked at the girl  in  spite of the real feeling of her tone a fretful look was predominant in  her face      do you  work hard   she asked  merely to relieve the pause      work  yes  but mere work won t do it  i can t do anything like  this    it was in bitterness she said it      very few can  you know   murmured ernestine      yes  but i want to  i don t care anything about life  i don t care  anything about anything  if i can t paint      it struck her immediately as so entirely wrong  she looked at the girl   and then again at the pictures  all the great things they conveyed were  passing her by  she missed the essence of it  the greatness of the work  merely moved her to anger because she was not great herself  it was an  attitude to close the soul      but you should care for life   she said  in her very gentle way   do the  best you can with your own work  but work like this should  above  everything else  make you care for life      the girl moved impatiently   you don t understand  i guess you are not an  artist   and she rose and went away     ernestine smiled a trifle  but the strange little interview had opened up  a long vista  the girl represented  in extreme measure  but  fundamentally  the professional attitude  most artists saw work in  relation to themselves  pictures were either better or worse than they  could do  they came to the great things like these  seeking something   usually some mechanical device  to take away to their own work  she could  see so plainly now the shallowness of that     her own mood had changed   broken  perhaps it was the consciousness that  she too had been seeing it in relation to herself  or it may have been  but natural reaction  the big uprising was dying down  the heat of the  passion had passed  it was all different now  and in the wake of her  brimming moment there came the calm that follows storm  the sadness of  spirit which attends the re enthronement of reason  but also the  understanding  far seeingness  which is the aftermath of great passion  like that     there had come to her  as she sat there beside the girl  a throbbing  determination to do both things  the thought had come before  but always  to be banished  it came now with new insistence just because anything  else seemed so impossible  there had never come  even to the outermost  edge of her consciousness  the thought of giving up the work she was  going to do for karl  her hardest hour had never even suggested the  possibility of surrender  her love had seen its way  her life had been  consecrated  but now  when it seemed no longer within her power to deny  the work for which she had been ordained  it seemed that to fulfill both  things was the one thing possible  but in this after moment of unblurred  understanding she saw she could do both things only by taking from the  things she gave to karl  it would mean giving her soul to the one  and  what she had left to the other  and she knew that she could never do what  she meant to do for karl unless she gave everything within herself to  that cause  the chief aim of her struggle in the laboratory had not been  to acquire knowledge and usefulness  that she could do  she knew  her  real aim had been to give to karl s work the things she had always given  to her own  with a divided soul she could do no more for him than any  other assistant  she was seeking to give him herself  oh no  it was  simple enough  she had no thought of offering karl an empty vessel     her mind saw it all  her will never wavered  but the bruised  conquered  spirit quivered under the pain  a long time she sat there  and as the  hour went by a strange thing happened  the pictures were healing the  spirit which they had torn  as they had first moved her to the frenzy  for achievement  had then left her with the pain of relinquishment   they were bringing her now something of the balm of peace  how big they  were   first passion  then pain  then understanding  now strength     ernestine came in that hour to see a great truth  it was something she  worked out for herself  something taught her by life and her own heart   and that is why it reached her soul as it could never have done had she  but read it in books  she came to see that the greatest thing in life was  to be in harmony with the soul of the world  she came into the  understanding that to do that  one need not of necessity paint great  pictures  one need not stand for any specific achievement  one need only  so work out one s life that one made for harmony and not for discord  the  greatest thing pictures could do was to draw men into this world harmony   these pictures were great because they reached the soul  and she came to  see  and this is what few do see  that the soul which is reached is not  less great than the soul which has spoken  she too could have been one of  the souls to speak  she accepted that in the simplicity with which we  receive the indisputable  but it was good to think that she would not  have failed utterly in fulfilling herself  if at the end  no matter  through what  she made for harmony  and not for discord     she grew so quiet then  the quiet of deep understanding  a long time  she sat before a picture of light out beyond some trees  oh what a  world  with the light coming through the trees like that  and men to see  it  and make it seen  she wished karl might see these pictures  she  looked at them with a new intentness   she would tell karl all about  them  he would be so glad she had come     she rose to go  once more she looked around at the pictures  and to her  eyes there came a dimness  and to her spirit a deep and tender yearning   there would be joy in having done such work as this  but there were other  things  to work out one s life as bravely and well as one knew how  to do  what seemed best  to be faithful and unfailing to those who were nearest  one  to be willing to lay down one s life for one s love   perhaps when  the end of the world was reached  and all things translated in terms of  universal things  to have done that would itself mean the painting of a  masterpiece  perhaps the god of things as they are would see the  unpainted pictures           chapter xxx      eyes for two     this day smells as though it had been made in the country   karl said   leaning from the dining room window which ernestine had thrown wide open  as she rose from the breakfast table      yes  and looks that way   she responded  leaning out herself  and taking  a long draught of the spring      let s take a walk   he said abruptly      except when you asked me to marry you  you never proposed a more  delightful thing   she responded with gayer laugh than he had heard for a  long time      suppose we walk down through the park and take a look at the lake   he  suggested      i call that a genuine inspiration    losing no time in getting karl s  things and her own     nothing could have pleased her more than this  it seemed beginning the  spring right      i can fancy we are in europe   he said  after they had gone a little  way  and she laughed understandingly   this seemed closer to the spirit  of the old days than they had come for a long time     her guiding hand was on his arm  but more as if she liked to have it  there  than as though necessary   your little finger could pilot me  through hades  he said  lovingly  gratefully  as a light touch told him of  a step to go down  and again she laughed  it was very easy to laugh this  morning     the winter  full of hard things for them both  had gone now  and spring   as is spring s way  held promise  in the laboratory they no longer  treated ernestine with mere courteous interest  that day in december when  she went down to dr  parkman s operation had marked a change  since then  there had been a light ahead  a light which shed its rays down the path  she must go     what did it matter if she were a little stupid about this or that  if mr   beason was unconsciously rude or mr  willard consciously polite  for she   knew  now  and did anything matter save the final things  with her own  feeling of its not mattering their attitude had seemed to change  she  became more as one with them  she was quick to get that difference    you re arriving on the high speed   dr  parkman had assured her when he  visited the laboratory a few days before     so she knew why she was happy  for added to all that was it not a  glorious and propitious thing that karl felt like taking a walk  did it  not argue a new interest in life  a new determination not to be shut off  from it  and karl  why did he too seem to feel that the spring held new  and better things  was it just the call of spring  or did karl sense the  good things ahead  could it be that her soul  unable to contain itself  longer  had whispered to his that new days were coming      why  even a fellow on his way to the penitentiary for life would have to  get some enjoyment out of this morning   he said  after they had stood  still for a minute to listen to the song of a bird  and had caught the  sweetness of a flowering tree      and oh  karl   she laughed  joyously   you re  not  on your way to the  penitentiary for life       no   he said  and he seemed to be speaking to something within himself  rather than to her    i m  not       they had reached jackson park  and sat down for a little rest before they  should wend their way on to the lake   oh  ernestine   he said  taking it  in in long breaths  feeling the dew upon his face  and hearing the murmur  of many living things     tell  me about it  dear  i want to see it too       karl  every tree looks as though it were just as glad as we are  can t  you feel that the trees feel just as we do about things  the leaves  haven t all come out yet  some of them are holding themselves within  themselves in a coy little way they have  although intending all the time  to come out just as fast as ever they can  and it s that glorious   unspoiled green  the kind nature uses to make painters feel foolish  oh   nature s having much fun with the painters this morning  right over  there    pointing with his finger   is such a beautiful tree  i like it  because all of its branches did not go in the way they were expected to  go  several of them were very perverse children  who mother trunk thought  at one time were going to ruin her life  but you know lives aren t so  easily ruined after all   now you go right up there at an angle of  twenty two degrees   she said to her eldest child   not at all   said the  firstborn   i intend to lean right over here at whatsoever angle will  best express my individuality   and though the mother grieved for a long  time she knows now  karl  how foolish we are  but listen  you hear that  bird who is trying to get all of his soul into his throat at once  he s   way up there on the top branch  higher than everything else  and so  pleased and proud that he is  and he s singing to a little blue cloud  straight above him  and i tell you i never saw such blue  such blue  within blue  its outside dress is a very filmy blue  but that s made over  an under dress of deeper blue  and there s just a little part in it where  you can see right into the heart  and that s a blue so deep and rich it  makes you want to cry  and oh  karl  the heart itself has opened a little  now  and you can get a suggestion  just a very indefinite suggestion  but  then all inner things are indefinite  that inside the heart of the cloud  is its soul  and you are permitted one fleeting glimpse to tell you that  the soul of the cloud is such a blue as never was dreamed of on land or  on sea       i can see that cloud   he said    and the bird looking up at it  and the  tree whose eldest child was so perverse and so  individual       and  karl   she went on  in joyous eagerness   can t you see how the  earth heaved a sigh right here a couple of hundred centuries ago  now   don t  tell me the park commissioners made them   and that when it  settled back from its sigh it never was quite the same again  it was  a sigh of content  for the little slopes are so gentle  gentle little  hills are sighs of content  and bigger ones are determinations  and  mountains  what are mountains  karl       mountains are revolutionary instincts   he said  smiling at her  fancifulness  ernestine was always fanciful when she was happy      yes  that s it  sometimes i like the stormy upheavals which change the  whole face of the earth  but this morning it s nice to have just the  little sighs of content  and  dear  now turn around and look this way   you can t really see the lake at all  but you can tell by looking down  that way that it is there       how can you tell  liebchen   he asked  just to hear her talk      oh  i don t know  how  you can  it s not scientific knowledge  it s  the  other kind  the trees know that the lake is there       let s walk down to the lake   he said   i want to feel it on my face   and oh  liebchen  it s good to have you tell about things like this      as they walked she told him of all she saw  the people they met  and what  she was sure the people were thinking about  once she laughed aloud  and  when he asked what she was laughing at  she said   oh  that chap we just  passed was amusing  his eyes were saying   my allowance is all gone and i  haven t a red sou  but isn t it a bully day        there s no reason why i should be shut out from the world  ernestine    he said vigorously   when you have eyes for two       why  that s just what i think   she said  quickly  her voice low  and  her heart beating fast     the shadows upon the grass  the nursemaids and the babies  the boys and  girls playing tennis  or just strolling around happy to be alive  she  could make karl see them all  and as they came in sight of the lake she  began telling him how it looked in the distance  how it seemed at first  just a cloud dropped down from the sky  but how  upon coming nearer  it  was not the stuff that clouds are made of  but a live thing  a great live  thing pulsing with joy in the morning sunshine  she told him how some of  it was blue and some of it was green  while some of it was blue wedded to  green  and some of it too elusive to have anything to do with the  spectrum   and  dearie  it is flirting with the sunlight  flirting  shamefully  i m almost ashamed for the lake  only it s so happy in its  flirtation that perhaps it is not bothered with moral consciousness  but  it seems to want the sunlight to catch it  and then it seems to want to  get away  and sometimes a sunbeam gets a little wave that stayed too long  and kisses it right here in open day  and isn t it awful  but isn t it  nice      in so many ways she told how the lake seemed to her  how it seemed to her  eyes and how it seemed to her heart and how it seemed to her soul  how it  looked  what it said  what it meant  what the clouds thought of it  and  what the sunlight thought of it  what the wind thought of it  what the  dear babies on the shore thought of it  and what it thought of itself   she could not have talked that way to any one else  but it was so easy  for her heart to talk to karl s heart  one pair of eyes could do just as  well as two when hearts were tuned like this     and then  when she did not feel like talking any more  they stood there  and learned many things from the voice of the lake itself   ernestine    he said  when they turned from it at last   it seems to me i never saw  lake michigan quite so well before            chapter xxxi      science and super science     insubordinate children who play off from school in the morning must work  in the afternoon   karl said at luncheon  and they went to their work  that afternoon with freshened spirit     when the mccormicks gave up their flat at christmas time  beason had come  to live with the hubers  ernestine prided herself upon some cleverness in  having rented two rooms without karl s suspecting it was a matter of  renting the rooms  when he engaged ross as his secretary in the fall she  said it would be more convenient for them all for mr  ross to have his  room there  they had an extra room  so why not  she did not put it the  other way  that she felt the house more expensive than they should have  now  of course karl would make money in his books  that had been settled  in advance  but things had changed for them  and ernestine felt the need  of caution  then as to beason  she said there was that little room he  could have  and it would do the boy good to be there   you like john    she said to karl   and as he has not yet been graduated into philosophy   he may be more companionable than mr  ross   and karl said by all means  to have beason if it wouldn t bother her to have him around     she was glad of that for more reasons than a reduced rent  beason had  become a great help to ernestine  after he came there to live they fitted  up some things for her in her studio  and she managed to get in a number  of extra hours when karl thought she was busy with her pictures     in her glow of spirit this afternoon  that walk in the park had meant so  much as holding promise for the future  ernestine was even willing to  admit  looking back upon it  that the winter had not been nearly so bad  as one would suppose  mr  beason and mr  ross were both  in their  differing ways  alert and interesting  and there had been some good  wrangles around the evening fire  other people had found them out  and  they had drawn to them an interesting group of friends  so the days had  flowed steadily on  a brave struggle to meet life in good part  keep that  good fellowship of the spirit     one of the hardest things of all had been deceiving karl  her reason  justified it  but it hurt her heart  they had been able to do it   however  better than she would have believed possible  mr  ross was with  him most of the time when she was not  and had frequently been forced to  intercept some caller who was close to an innocent remark about mrs   hubers being over at the university  several times karl had caught the  odour of the laboratory about her  and she had been forced to explain it  as the odour of the studio  and more than once  in the midst of a  discussion  her interest had beguiled her into some surprisingly  intelligent remark  and she had been obliged to invent laughing reasons  for knowing anything about it  it hurt her deeply to take advantage of  karl s blindness in keeping things from him  even though the motive was  all love for karl  and determination to help  she would be so glad when  all that was over  and she thought as she worked along very hard that  afternoon that perhaps it would not be many days now until karl should  know     that would be for dr  parkman to say  so many vital things seemed left to  dr  parkman   did you ever think   she said  turning to mr  beason  who  was busy at the table beside her   what the doctor really counts for in  this world       yes  in a way   said beason  adjusting his microscope   but then i never  was sick much       well  i didn t mean just taking one s pulse   she laughed   it seems to  me they mean more than prescriptions  for one thing  i think it s rather  amusing the way they all practice christian science       why  what do you mean   he demanded  aroused now  and shocked      oh  i ve come to the conclusion that a modern  first class doctor is a  christian scientist who preserves his sanity   she paused  laughing a  little at beason s bewildered face  and at the thought of how little her  formula would be appreciated in either camp   i ve noticed it down at dr   parkman s office   she went on   it s quite a study to listen to him at  the telephone  he will wrangle around all sorts of corners to get  patients to admit something is in better shape than it was yesterday  and  though they called up to say they were worse  they end in admitting they  are much better  he just forces them into saying something is better  and  then he says  triumphantly   oh  that s fine    and the patient rings off  immensely cheered up       that s a kind of trickery  though   said beason      pretty good kind of trickery  if it helps people get well       well i shouldn t care to be a practicing physician   beason declared    just for that reason  that sort of business would be very distasteful to  me      ernestine was about to say something  and then relegated it to the things  better left unsaid  but she permitted herself a wise little smile      i don t think it s such an awfully high grade of work   he went on   in  a way it is  of course  but there s so much repetition and routine  so  much that doesn t count scientifically at all  doesn t count for anything  but the patient       but what is science for   she demanded  aggravated now   has medical  science any value save in its relation to human beings       oh yes  i know  in the end   he admitted vaguely      all this laboratory work is simply to throw more power into the hands of  the general practitioner  it s to give him more light  it s just because  his work  is  so important that this work has any reason for being  dr   hubers saw it that way   she concluded  with the air of delivering the  unanswerable      but even that wasn t just what i meant   she went on  after they had  worked silently for a few minutes   what i was thinking about was the  superdoctor      beason simply stared      no  not entirely crazy   she laughed   for instance  what can a man do  for nervous indigestion without infusing a little hope  think of what  doctors know  not only about people s bodies  but about their lives   cause and effect overlap  don t they  half the time a run down body means  a broken spirit  or a twisted life  how can you set part of a thing right  when the whole of it s wrong  how  can  a doctor be just a doctor  if  he s a good one      but nothing  super  could be expected of beason  his very blank face  recalled her to the absurdity of getting out of focus with one s  audience     she herself felt it strongly  it seemed to her that dr  parkman s real  gift was his endowment in intuition  when all was going well she heard  nothing from him  but let things begin to drag  and the doctor appeared   rich in resources  he seemed to have in reserve a wide variety of  stimulants     he looked in upon them often  whenever in their neighbourhood he stopped   and though frequently he could not so much as take time to sit down   the day always went a little better for his coming   if the end of the  world were upon us  dr  parkman could avert the calamity for a day or  two  couldn t he  karl   ernestine had laughed after one of his visits     this proved to be one of the days of his stopping in  and he arrived just  as karl was dictating a few final sentences to mr  ross  while they were  finishing  he said he was not in a hurry today  he took a keen look at  karl s face  his colour was not good  the doctor thought  in fact several  things were not to his liking   too many hard times with himself   he  summed it up    droopy  needs a bracer  needs to get back in the  harness  that s the only medicine for him      he had been thinking about that very seriously of late  ernestine was at  least in position now to show the possibilities of the situation  and  working with karl would do more for her in a month than working along  this way would do in five  why not  no matter how long they waited it was  going to be hard at first  the deep lines in karl s face furnished the  strongest argument against further waiting      what have we here   he asked  picking up one of the embossed books lying  open on the table near karl      i presume that s my bible   karl replied      has it come to this   the doctor asked dryly      didn t we ever tell you the story of my bible       no  you never did  i never suspected you had one       oh yes  the bible was the first book of this sort i had  it was sent to  me by some home missionary society  some woman s organization        fools   broke in parkman      they saw in the paper about my eyes and so they said to themselves   now  here is a good chance to convert one of those ungodly scientists   so  they sent the bible along with a nice little note saying that now i  would have time to read it  and perhaps all of this was the hand of  god leading me  you can construct the rest  well   he paused with a  laugh   ernestine was mad       i should hope so   growled parkman      she was so divinely angry that in having fun with her i overlooked being  enraged myself  oh  if i could only give you any idea of how incensed she  was  i think she intended notifying the chicago police  really i don t  know to what lengths she would have gone had it not been for my  restraining influence  and then she constructed a letter  it was a  masterpiece  i can tell you that  she compared me to them  greatly to  their disadvantage  she spoke of the various kinds of religious  manifestation  again greatly to their disadvantage       did she send it   laughed the doctor      no  i persuaded her that well intentioned people should receive the same  kindly tolerance we extend to the mentally defective  the writing of the  letter in itself half way contented her  it was such a splendid  expression of her emotions  poor old girl   he added musingly   she was  feeling pretty sore about things just then       but the sequel is the queer part   he went on   i began to read their  bible  and i like it  it s part of the irony of fate that i haven t  gotten from it the things they intended i should  but i tell you part of  this old testament is immense reading  you know  parkman  i suppose we re  prejudiced ourselves  we don t see the bible as it is itself  we see it  in relation to a lot of people who surround it  and because we don t care  for some of them we think we shouldn t care for it  whereas the thing in  itself   he concluded cheerfully   is just what we d like       and how go your own books   dr  parkman asked him     karl shrugged one shoulder in a nervous little way he had acquired    oh  so  so  pretty fair  i guess   his face settled into a gloom then   but almost immediately he roused himself from it to say  in a voice more  cheerful than spontaneous   they ll be finished in a couple of weeks  i m  both glad and sorry  don t know just what i ll go at then      again he seemed to settle into the gloom which the doctor could see was  ever there waiting to receive him  but again he roused himself almost  immediately  was it this way with the man all the time  a continuous  fight against surrendering   but i m mighty thankful i ve had the books    he said   they ve pulled me through the winter  and they ve enabled me to  make a living  lord  but a man would hate not to make a living   he  concluded  straightening up a trifle  more like the karl of old     the sheer pathos of it had never come home to the doctor as it did with  that  a man who should have stood upon the very mountain peaks of fame  now proudly claiming that he was able to make a living  but if it brought  home the pathos of the situation it also brought new sense of the manhood  of karl hubers  it was great  parkman told himself  great  a man who felt  within himself all the forces which make for greatness could force  himself into the place of the average man  and thank the lord that he was  able to make a living      here s a little scheme i ve worked out   karl said  and opening one of  the drawers of the library table  pulled out the model for the idea he  had worked out for reading and writing in braille     it was the first dr  parkman had heard of it  he wanted to know all about  it  and karl explained how it had seemed to him as soon as he learned how  the blind read and wrote that the thing could be simplified and vastly  improved  so he had worked this out  he explained its points of  difference  and wanted to know what parkman thought of it      why  man   exclaimed the doctor   it strikes me you ve revolutionized  the whole business  but  why  karl  nobody ever thought of this before       the usual speech   laughed karl      but in this case it seems so confoundedly true       well i believe it will help some  and i ll be glad of that   he added  simply   oh i have some more schemes  if i ve got to be blind i m going  to make blindness a better business       our old friend the devil didn t do so well then after all   said dr   parkman quietly   he closed up one channel  but he didn t figure on your  burrowing another      karl laughed   oh this won t worry him much  it came so easily i can t  think it amounts to a great deal  but as long as i was used to scheming  things out it  amused me  exercised a few cells that were in pretty bad  need of a job  and i have other ideas   he repeated     parkman asked what karl intended to do with his model  offering some  suggestions  the doctor was more than interested and pleased  he  was deeply stirred   why  confound the fellow   he was saying to  himself    they  can t  knock him out  they knock him down in one place   and he bobs up in another   the ideas of this brain were as difficult to  suppress as certain other things in nature  dam up one place  they find  another     they smoked their cigars and talked intermittently then  they were close  enough together to be silent when they chose  and all the while the  undercurrent of dr  parkman s thought flowed steadily on     he was thinking that after all there were better things to do with fate  than damn it  if ever a man would seem justified in spending his soul in  the damning of fate  that man  it seemed to him  was the friend beside  him  and while he had done some of it  perhaps a great deal more than any  one knew  it had not been his master passion  his master passion had been  to press on  press on to be knew not what  there was the glory of it  it  was easy enough to work toward a goal sighted ahead  but it took a karl  hubers to work on through the darkness     and ah  there was a good time coming  the doctor s sombre face relaxed to  a smile  his own life seemed almost worth living now just because he had  been able to take a hand  yes  and play a few good cards  in this little  game  those things karl had shown him today made it seem there was all  the finer joy in bringing him back to the things which were his own  he  had been thrust from out the gates  but he had not sat whimpering outside  the wall  he had gone on and sought to find a place in that outer world  in which he found himself  and now he should come back to his own through  gates of glory     karl asked him about ernestine then  how was she looking  was she  thin  pale  her face felt pale to him  he said  he had urged her to work   because he knew she would be happier so  but parkman must see to it she  did not overwork  had he seen the picture on which she was working so  hard  he asked that wistfully  and the doctor s face was soft  and a  gentleness crept into his voice as he said he believed he was to see the  great picture very soon now  and then  after a silence  karl said   softly  very tenderly   bless her gamey little heart            chapter xxxii      the doctor has his way    it was in response to the doctor s telephone message that ernestine went  down to his office one afternoon a few days later  dr  parkman had been  detained at the hospital  they told her  but would be there very soon   and so she sat down in the waiting room  which was already well filled   were there always people there waiting for him  and did they not  sometimes grow impatient and want to find a doctor who would not keep  them waiting so long     the woman sitting near her looked friendly  and so she asked   don t you  get very tired waiting for dr  parkman       oh  yes   sighed the woman   very tired       then why don t you go to some doctor who would attend to you more  quickly   she pursued  moved chiefly by the desire to see what would  happen     the woman stared  grew red  and replied frigidly   because i do not wish  to      all the other patients were staring at ernestine  too   why don t you do  that yourself   asked a large woman with a sick looking small boy      i guess if there was anything much the matter with you  you d be willing  to wait   said a pale woman with a weary voice     and then a man  she was sure that man was a victim of cancer  said  loftily   a doctor you never have to wait for isn t the doctor you want       the only thing seems queer to me   said a meek looking woman  taking  advantage of the outbreak   is that he don t look at your tongue  down in  indiana  where i come from  they always look at your tongue  there s a  lot of questions he don t ask   she ventured  looking around for either  assent or information      he asks all there s any need of   the first woman assured her   i guess   you  aren t very sick   turning  witheringly  to ernestine     and then they went back to their waiting  those who had rocking chairs  rocking  those who had magazines reading  or turning leaves at least   some just sitting there and looking into space  it must take away all  sense of freedom to feel that people like this  sick people for whom  everything was hard  were always waiting for one     she would tell the doctor how she had been well nigh mobbed by loyal  patients  they were like a great family  she knew well enough they did  considerable grumbling  but her remark put her without the fold  and from  her as an alien  criticism was not to be brooked  by the glare with which  the first woman still regarded her she was sure she was suspected of  being an agent sent there by some inferior doctor to try and get dr   parkman s patients away from him     ernestine was tired  and she believed she would have to admit that she  was nervous  she had been working harder  she supposed  than she should   but the further she went the more she saw to do  and something from  within was eternally pushing her on     as she waited  her mind turned to the stories that office must hold   how much of anxiety and suffering and sorrow and tragedy  and occasional  joy  it must know  the mothers who brought children whom others had  declared incurable  how tense these moments of waiting must be for them   the husband and wife who came together to find out whether she would have  to have the operation  how many of the crucial moments of life were lived  in such places as this  the power in these doctors vested  the power of  their voice  their slightest glance  in holding men from the brink of  despair  who could know the human heart better than they  they did not  meet the every day men and women well groomed with restraints and  pretence  for it was an hour when the soul was stripped bare that the  doctor looked in upon it  men were various things to various people  but  to the doctor they came very close to being themselves  too much was at  stake to dissemble here  when phantoms of fear and death took shape in  the shadows one sought the doctor  and told the truth     she had a fancy which moved her then  she saw the men like dr  parkman  fighting darkness down in the valley  while from the mountain peak  adjacent men like karl turned on  as with mighty search lights  more  and  ever more  of the light  and what were the search lights for if not to be  turned down into the valley      what time did you go to bed last night   he demanded  after they had  shaken hands in the inner office      why  did you see the light   she faltered   she had made a promise  against late hours      the light  no  but i see your face now  and that s enough  was it  two  or worse       just a mere trifle worse  and truly  doctor  i didn t mean to  but don t  you know it s hard to stop when you feel just right for a thing  why  one  can t always do things at the proper time   she expostulated      no  and one can t always keep an abused nervous system from going to  pieces either  did you ever stop to think of that       but you ll look after the nervous system   she replied ingenuously      now that s where a lot of you make the mistake  i can t do anything at  all without the cooperation of common sense       well i m intending to be real good from this on   she laughed   but it  is so important that i know everything      he laughed then too   a very destructive notion       tell me   he said  when he had settled himself in his chair in the  particular way of settling himself when he intended having a talk with  her   have you been rewarded in all this by any pleasure in it  whatsoever  i don t mean   he made clear  anticipating her   just the  pleasure of doing something for karl  but has your work given you any  enthusiasm for the thing in itself       doctor  it has  and that was something i was afraid of  but you should  have heard me talking to mr  ross the other day when he made one of his  patronising remarks about mere science  i believe that when you work hard  at almost anything you develop some enthusiasm for it       um  a rather doubtful compliment for science       it was rather beasonish   she laughed   but you see in the beginning my  face was turned the other way      he gave her one of those concentrated glances then   and how about that   never feel any more like heading the other way      she smiled  and the smile seemed to be covering a great deal   oh  sometimes the perverse side of me feels like turning the other way  there  are many sides to us  aren t there  but never mind about that   she  hastened   that is just something between me and myself  i can suppress  all insurrections      there was a pause  she leaned back in the big chair and was resting   he had seen from the first that she was very tired   no desire to back  out    he threw that out a little doubtfully     she sat up straight  she looked  first angry  and then as if she were  going to cry   doctor  tell me  am i  that  unconvincing  hasn t the  winter        this winter   he interrupted gently   has proved that you knew what you  were talking about when you came to me last fall  could i say more than  that  i only asked the question   he explained   because this is the last  chance for retreat      and then he told her  watching the changing expressions of her responsive  face  but at the last there was a timidity  a sort of frightened  fluttering      but doctor  am i ready   can  i really do it  there is so much i don t  know       the consciousness of which is excellent proof of your progress  my idea  is this  in any case it is going to be hard at the first  you might go on  another year  and of course be in better shape  but i don t know just  what karl would be doing in that year  he s in need of a big rousing up   and as for you  after working the year with him  you ll be a long way  ahead of where you would be alone  so it argues itself that way from both  standpoints  i made up my mind when i was out the other day that karl  needs just what this is going to give       you think he looks badly   she flew at that  relinquishing all else    you think karl s not well       i didn t mean that  but he needs the hope  the enthusiasm  activity   this is going to give       hasn t he been splendid this winter   she asked softly  those very deep  warm lights in her eyes   did you ever see anything like it  doctor       i thought i knew something about courage   he replied shortly   but karl  makes me think i didn t       i don t believe there are many men could turn from big things to smaller  ones  and grow bigger instead of smaller   she said  with a very tender  pride      they say scientists are narrow and bull headed  wonder what they would  say to this  and there s another thing to remember  we have seen the  results of the victories  only karl hubers knows of the fights       i know of some of them   said ernestine  simply      yes   he corrected himself   you  and before we quite deify karl we must  reckon with you  he could not have done it without you       he would not have tried   she said  and the man turned away  that look  was not his to see     when she recalled herself it was with a sense of not having been kind   why did she say things like that to dr  parkman after karl had told  her     and you  doctor   she said in rather timid reparation   i wonder  if you know what you have done for us both       oh  i haven t counted for much   he said almost curtly   it would have  worked itself out without me   but even as he spoke he was wishing with  all his heart that there was some way of showing her what they had meant  to him  he did not do it  for a soul which has been long apart grows  fearful of sending itself out  fearful of making itself absurd     they talked it all out then  going at practical things in a very  matter of fact way   and now   said the doctor   i have a suggestion  it  is more than a suggestion  it is a request  a little more than a request   even  a        command   she smiled at him      you know   he began   how it is with the athletes  sometimes they become  overtrained  which is the worst thing could happen to them  a good  trainer never puts overtrained men in the game  now  my dear enthusiastic  friend    she was looking at him in that intent way of hers   i ve  noticed two or three times that you ve about jumped out of your chair at  some meaningless noise in the other room  your eyes tell the story   oh  there are various ways of reading it  you re a little overtrained  before  you tell karl the great secret i want you to go away by yourself for a  couple of weeks and rest       you mean that i should leave karl   she demanded      i do  i want you to have change  rest  and for that matter a little  lonesomeness won t be a bad thing  you ll be in just the right mood then  to put it all to him when you come back  he ll be in just the right mood  to take it       oh  but  doctor  you don t understand  i can t leave karl  there are  things i do for him no one else could do  why you must remember he s  blind   she concluded  passionately     she was not easy to win  but he stated his case  and one by one met her  arguments  yes  karl would be lonely  but when she came back he would be  so glad to see her that he would be a much better subject for enthusiasm  than he was now  she also would be in better mood   if you tell him now    he said   and he makes some objections  says it can t be done  ten to  one  as you are now  you will begin to cry  a nice termination for your  whole winter s work  you must go to him just as you came to me in the  beginning  overwhelm him  take him whether or no  and you re not right  for that now  it s just because i m bound this thing shall go through   that i insist you do as i say       couldn t karl go with me   she asked  quite humbly  her eyes pleading  eloquently     he showed her  kindly  but very decisively  that that would not make the  point at all  there followed then but a few final protestations  where  would karl think she was  what in the world would he think of her  going  away and leaving him like that  who would look after him  what if he  needed some help he didn t get  suppose he grew so lonesome and depressed  he just couldn t stand it     on all of which points he somewhat banteringly reassured her  other men  had been lonesome now and then  and it had not quite killed them  beason  and ross were in the house  and there was a good maid  who adored dr   hubers   as to where he thinks you are  i ll tell him half the truth   that you are a little nervous and i have prescribed change and rest      but she would not agree to that   karl would worry   she said   we ll  tell him instead that i have to go to new york to see about my picture   it will be easier for karl if he thinks it is about my work      he yielded to her judgment in that  and agreed to the further compromise  that if she found she could not possibly stay away two weeks she might  come back in one     it was the change  the going away  the getting lonesome the doctor wanted  most of all  he wanted to lift her clear up to her highest self that she  might have all that was hers to give when she told her story to karl      and of course  doctor   she asked anxiously   when the time comes you  will talk to him too  tell him you feel i can do it       trust me for that   he said briefly      but where is it i am to go   she laughed  as she was ready to leave     he told her then of a place in michigan  an old nurse of his had married  and was living there  and he frequently sent patients to her as boarders    i have written to her and she wants you to come   he said      well  upon my word  before i so much as said i would go       why certainly   he answered  looking a trifle surprised   for three  days  perhaps five  i want you to sleep  you ll find you re very  tired  once you let go  then you can walk in the woods  i think it s  going to be warm enough for browsing around  and you can think of karl    he said with a touch of humour  and a touch of something else   and of  all this is going to mean  i ve thought a great many times of what you  said about the statue  there s something mighty stirring in that idea of  unconquerableness       there is   she responded      a great thing  you know  is worth making a few sacrifices for  you ve  made some pretty big ones for this  now make this one more  haven t you  been laying claim to great faith in my judgment       oh yes  as a matter of judgment  only        very well then  be lonesome  if you must be lonesome  i hope you will  be  it s part of the treatment  and then you ll come back and in your  first bursts of delight tell karl just what you ve done  when he says  it s impossible  you ll just laugh  you ll get him to try and then the  day is yours      out on the street she stopped half a dozen times in the first block   thinking she would go back and tell dr  parkman she couldn t possibly  leave karl   why  he s a terrible man   she mused  half humorously  half  tearfully   sending wives away from husbands like this  wanting people  to be lonesome  just because he thinks it s good for them  i ll not do  it  i ll go back and tell him i  won t    but she did not go back  she  felt dr  parkman might look unpleasant if a patient came back to say   i  won t     no one would ever get up courage enough for that   she  concluded mournfully   so i ll just have to go            chapter xxxiii      love s own hour    it was sunday  and ernestine was going away next morning  she had told  karl the day before  it alarmed him at first  for he telephoned dr   parkman  asking him to come out  when the doctor arrived he demanded the  truth as to ernestine  had anything happened  was she not well  he was so  relieved at the doctor s assurance that ernestine was perfectly well  and  was going away because of her work  that he accepted the situation more  easily than she had anticipated   perhaps it will do me good  liebchen    he told her   i fear i m getting to be a selfish brute  taking everything  for granted and not appreciating you half enough      but that afternoon it was ernestine herself who was forced to fight hard  for cheerfulness  she did not want to go away  she was curiously  depressed about it  and resentful  more than once she was on the point of  telephoning to dr  parkman that she could not leave karl     georgia and joe and mrs  mccormick came in about five and georgia s  spirit seemed to blow through the house like a strong  full current of  bracing air  she and joe had returned from california the night before   and there were many things to tell about their trip  mrs  mccormick said  it was indeed curious how some people always had so many more adventures  than other people had  she wondered why it was she never met any of these  amusing persons georgia was always telling about     their visit did ernestine much good  it was impossible to feel blue or  have silly forebodings in the presence of so much naturalness and cheer  as always emanated from georgia  those hearty laughs had cleared the  atmosphere for her      look here  liebchen   said karl  emerging from a brown study   we must  fix up a code       a code  dear       for your writing to me  you see ross will have to read the letters  and  how can you say in every other line you love me  with that duffer reading  it out loud       oh  karl  how stupid of me not to learn writing the other way  you see  it never occurred to me i would be away from you  couldn t i take that  manual  and make it out from that       well  you might  but we ll do both  it will be fun to have a code  now   when you say   i am a trifle tired   you mean   oh  sweetheart  i am so  lonesome for you that i am never going away again        but won t mr  ross think it strange if i say in each letter that i am a  trifle tired       what do we care what he thinks  they re not his letters  are they  and  when you say   new york seems most attractive    you mean   oh  dearest   i never dreamed i loved you so much  i am finding out in a thousand new  ways how much i care  and never  never  shall we be separated again        and when i say   i send you my love   it will be perfectly proper for  mr  ross to read that  i mean   dear love  i send you a thousand kisses   and i would give the world for one minute now in your arms       and so they arranged it   revising  enlarging  going over it a great many  times to have it all certain  there was such a tender kind of fun in it   as to the other side of it  karl of course could write to her on his  typewriter     it was a beautiful evening they had sitting there before the fire  she  saw pictures for him  and he even saw some pictures for her   he said a  blind man could see certain pictures no one else could possibly see  they  spoke of how they had never been separated since their marriage  of how  strange it would seem to be apart  but always of how beautiful to be  together again  there was such a sweetness  tenderness  in the sadness  which hung about their parting  they made the most of their pain  as is  the way of lovers  for it drew them together in a new way  and each kiss   each smallest caress  had a new and tender significance      you ll be back in time for your birthday  ernestine       oh  yes  i m only going to stay a week       i thought you said  perhaps two       did i  well i ve decided one will be enough       ernestine  what have you been painting  tell me  dear  that s one thing  i m a little disappointed in  i do so want to keep close to your work       well  karl   after a silence   that picture i have been working on this  winter is hard to tell about because it is in a field all new to me  it  is a picture which emphasises  or tries to  what love means to the  world   a picture which is the outgrowth of our love  i am not sure that  it is good in all its technical features  but i believe there is  atmosphere in it  poetic feeling  and  back of that  thought  and soul   and truth  i think there is harmony and richness of colour  some people  will say it is very daring  and no one will call it conventional  but i  am hoping    ernestine s voice was so low and full of feeling he could  scarcely get the words   that it is going to be a very great picture  the  greatest i have ever done  some of it has been hard for me  dear  in  truth i have been much discouraged at times  but great things are not  lightly achieved  karl  and if this is anything at all  it is one of the  great things  as to the subject  detail  i am going to ask you to wait  until i come back  i have been keeping it for you as a little surprise   perhaps it will help some of your lonely hours  dear   her voice  quivered   to think about the beautiful surprise  and if it seems strange  sometimes that i could bring myself to go away from you  will you not  bear in mind  karl dear  that i am doing it simply that the great  surprise may be made perfect for you  it is a whim of mine to keep this a  great secret  in the end i know you will forgive the secrecy  and when i  come back   her voice was stronger  fuller now   i am going to make you  see it just as plainly as you ever saw anything in all your life       you must  i couldn t bear it to be shut out from your work       you are not going to be shut out from my work    she said it with an  intensity almost stern      i want your life to be happy  ernestine   he said  after a time  and the  words seemed to have a new meaning spoken out of this mood of very deep  tenderness   i don t want it to be darkened  i want my love to make you  happy  in spite of it all       it does   she breathed    it does       but i want you to be  as you used to be  i haven t been fair in letting  this make such a difference with us       karl  how can you talk like that  when you have been so  splendid       but you see i don t want to be splendid   he said whimsically   i d  rather be a brute than be splendid  and i want you to love me always as  you did at first  just because you couldn t help yourself       i can not help myself now   she laughed   i am just as helpless as i  ever was      and then a long and very precious silence  she was filled with many  things too deep for utterance  even had she been free to speak  she  thought of her birthday night a year before  their happiness then  all  that had come to them since  all that love had meant  the great things it  was to do for them  she looked at karl s face  his fine  strong face  which seemed the very soul of the mellow fire light  how would that dear  face look when she told him what she had done  convinced him that great  things were before him now  would it not be that his determination not to  fail her would stir fires which  even in his most triumphant days  had  slumbered     but from exultation in all that  she passed to the heart s pain in  leaving him  she moved a little closer  took his hand and rested it  lovingly against her cheek  she had never been away from karl  tears came  at the thought of it now     and he must have been thinking of what ernestine had meant to him  in the last year  for of a sudden he stooped down and with his old  abandonment  with all the fullness of the first passion and the tender  understanding of these later days  gathered her into his arms   oh   ernestine   he whispered  breathing into her name all that was in his  heart    ernestine             chapter xxxiv      almost dawn    she found that in the beginning at least it was as dr  parkman had said   it was good to sleep  it was good to go to bed at night with the sense of  nothing to do in the morning  good to wake at the usual time only to feel  she might go back to that comfortable  beautiful sleep  for ernestine was  indeed very tired  since that day when the great idea had come to her  there had been no time when she was free from the sense of all that lay  before her  but now she could rest     strangely enough she did not worry greatly about karl  her first waking  thoughts were of him  but fuller consciousness always brought the feeling  that it was all right with karl  he was missing her  of course  but she  was going back to him very soon and bring him the things he had believed  shut away forever   bring him the light   that was the way she had come  to think of it  the deliciousness of her rest was in the sense of its  being right she should take it  she could best serve karl by resting  until she was her strongest self     her room was so quiet and restful  the bed so comfortable  and mrs   rolfe  dr  parkman s old nurse  so good to her  it was soothing to be  told to close her pretty eyes and go to sleep  sustaining to be met  with   now here is something for our little lady to eat   after many days  of responsibility it was good to be  mothered  a little     but after the first revel in sleep had passed she did a great deal of  languid  undisturbed thinking  she seemed detached from her life  and it  passed before her  not poignantly  but merely as something to look upon   quietly muse about  soon she would step back into it  but now she was  resting from it  simply viewing it as an interesting thing which kept  passing before her     from the very first it came before her  from those days when she was a  little girl at home  and she found much quiet entertainment in trying to  connect herself of those days with herself of the now   am i all one    she would want to know  and in thinking that over would quite likely fall  asleep again     she thought a great deal about her father and mother  they were more real  to her than they had been for a long time  but it was hard to connect the  ernestine of that home with the ernestine who belonged to karl  there was  georgia  to be sure  who extended clear through  dear georgia  how well  she had looked sunday in that beautiful black gown  she remembered such a  funny thing  and such a dear thing  georgia had done once  they had  become chums as freshmen and when they were sophomores georgia came to  their house to live  and one night she inadvertently said something  which started one of those terrible arguments  and ended in the saying  of so many bitter things that ernestine could not bear it  especially  before georgia  and as soon as she could she left the table and went  up to her room  she did not cry  her mother cried so much that it seemed  enough for the family  but she sat there very still looking straight  ahead  denying herself even the luxury of tears  and then  just when  that atmosphere of unhappiness and bitterness seemed pressing down  upon her  crushing her  there had come a wild shriek from  georgia   ernestine  ernestine  get your things quick  let s go to the  fire      that was not to be resisted even by a nineteen year old girl  she  remembered tumbling into her things  running two blocks  and then  gasping   where is it   and georgia replied  gasping too   don t  know  small boys  said so   and then after running all over town they  found there was no fire at all  and that had so overcome them with  laughter that she forgot all about those other things which would have  given her so miserable an evening  she had had just a little suspicion  then  and now she had a firm conviction  that georgia never heard small  boys say anything about fire that night  bless georgia s big heart  she  loved her for just such things as inventing fires for unhappy people to  go to     as she lay there resting  away from the current of her life  she thought  a great deal about a little grave over in france  such a very  very small  grave which represented a life which had really never come into the world  at all  she could fancy her baby here with her now  patting her face   pulling her hair  so warm and dear and sweet  her arms ached for that  little child which had been hers only in anticipation  and what it would  have meant to karl   the laughter of a very small voice  the cuddling of  a very small head     deep thoughts came then  and deeper yearnings  and  when mrs  rolfe came in at one of those times she was startled at the  look in the deep brown eyes of her patient  a look which seemed to be  asking for something which no one could give  and when ernestine smiled  at her  as she always did  the woman could scarcely keep back the  answering   never mind  dearie  never you mind      and through all of her thoughts there was karl  his greatness  his work   his love  she would be so happy when she did not have to keep things back  from karl  it seemed it would be the happiest moment of her life when she  could throw her soul wide open to him with   there is never going to be  another thing kept back from you   she could not bear the thought of  karl s believing she was in new york  but soon there would be no more of  that  and karl himself would tell her she had done it because she cared  so much     and most beautiful of all things to think about was the hour when she  would tell him  how would he look  what would he say     on the fifth morning she awakened feeling quite different  those  birds   what were they singing about  she got up and raised the curtain   and then drew in a long breath of delight  for it was a radiant spring  morning  breathing gladness and joy and all beautiful things  oh how  beautiful off there in the trees   the trees which were just coming back  to life after their long sleep  she too had been asleep  but it was time  now to wake up and be glad     she felt very much awake and alive this morning   oh  how those birds  were singing  she laughed in sheer happiness  and began to sing too  she  would dress and go out of doors  to remain in her room one hour longer  would be unbearable bondage  for all the world was awake and glad  she  could scarcely wait to get out there among the birds and trees     she had never felt so alive  so well tuned to life  so passionately eager  for its every manifestation as when  after a hurried breakfast  she  started up the beautiful green hill to the trees where all the birds were  singing  the soft breath of the spring enfolding her  her spirit lifting  itself up to meet the caress of the spirit of spring  she walked with  long  swinging step  smiling to herself  humming a glad little air  now  and then tossing her head just to get the breath of spring upon her face  in some new way  mrs  rolfe watched her from the kitchen door  smiling     on the hill top she stopped  standing straight  breathing deep  revelling  in the song of the birds  they were fairly intoxicated with joy at  this morning  listening to the soft murmur of the spring beneath it  all  happy  oh so happy  as she looked off to the far distances  the long  winter had gone  and now the spring had come again  the dear spring she  had always loved     it was with her too almost an intoxication  the throwing off of gloom   the taking on of joy  on such a morning nature calls unto her chosen  and  they hear her call  and are glad  as she stood there on her hill top her  spirit lifted itself up in lyric utterance  her whole being responded to  the songs of the returning birds     how well dr  parkman had planned it  she would go back now and tell karl  what a great thing it was to be alive  how the spirit was everything  and  could conquer all else  it seemed very easy now  it was all a matter of  getting the spirit right   how good of dr  parkman to think it out like  this     but there was something a little wrong  she stopped for a minute   pondering  now she knew  karl   why could he not be here too  all in an  instant she saw it so clearly that she laughed aloud  she was rested  now  ready to tell him  and  this  the place  she would send for him  mr   ross  or perhaps the doctor himself  would come with him  and here where  it was all so beautiful  where the call of the spring reached them and  made them glad  she would tell him  and then  his spirit strong as hers  was now strong  he would respond to it  be made ready for the fight     how simple and how splendid  how stupid not to have thought of this  before  and then again she laughed  it would be fun to improve on dr   parkman s idea  that was all very well  but this a thousand times better   karl s spirit too needed lifting up   what could do it as this  it was  true he could not see it with his eyes  but there were so many other ways  of being part of it  the singing of the birds  the scent of the budding  trees  the rich breath of spring upon one s face  and even the vision  should not be lost to him  she would make him see it  she would make him  see the sunlight upon the trees  the roll of that farther hillside  one  did not need to try to forget the park commissioners here   and then she  would say to him   see  karl  even as i can make you see the trees and  that little brook there in the hollow  just as plainly as i can make you  see the sky and the hill come together off there  so plainly will i make  you see the things in the laboratory which belong with your work   she  would prove to him by the picture she drew of these green fields in  spring time that she could make plain to him all he must see  how  glorious to prove it to him by the spring time     and then  both of them uplifted  gladdened  both of them believing it  could be done  loving each other more than they had ever done before   newly assured of the power of love  they would go back and with firm  faith and deep joy begin the work which lay before them     she turned to walk back to the house  she would send a telegram  to dr  parkman that karl must come  perhaps he could be here  to night   to morrow  surely  dear karl  who needed a vacation more than  he  who needed the rejuvenation of the spring as karl needed it     she had walked but a little way when she stopped  someone was coming  toward her  walking fast  had the sun grown a little dim  or was  something passing before her eyes  the world seemed to darken  she looked  again at mrs  rolfe  coming toward her  how strange that she shivered   was it a little chilly up here on the hill top where a minute before it  had been so soft and warm  she wanted to go to meet mrs  rolfe  but she  did not  she stood strangely still  waiting  and why was it that the  figure of mrs  rolfe was such a blur on the beauty of the hillside     but when at last she saw her face she did run to meet her   what is the  matter    her voice was quick and sharp     the woman hesitated      tell me   demanded ernestine   i will not be treated like that       dr  parkman wants you to come home   the woman said  not looking  ernestine in the face      why   karl    she caught roughly at the other woman s arm     she knew then that she could not temporise nor modify   dr  hubers was  taken sick yesterday  he was to have an operation  the telegram should  have been delivered last night      she thought ernestine was going to fall  she swayed so  her face went so  colourless  her hands so cold  but she did not fall   that  is all you  know    it came in hoarse  broken whisper     and when the woman answered  yes  ernestine started  running  for the  house           chapter xxxv       oh  hurry   hurry       that train   she would go mad if it kept stopping like that  she kept  leaning forward in her seat  every muscle tense  fairly pushing the train  on with every nerve that was in her  never once did she relax  on  on  it  must go on  she would  make  it go faster  when it stopped she clenched  her hands  her nails digging into the flesh  and then when it started  again that same feeling that she  from within herself  must push it on   at times she looked from the window  now this field was past  they  were so much nearer  soon they would be over there where the track  curved  that was a long way ahead  they were going faster now  she would  lean forward again  pushing on  trying through the straining of her own  nerves to make the train go faster     mrs  rolfe had wanted to come with her  but she said no  it seemed she  could get there faster by herself  there had been an hour s wait for the  train  it made her sick  even now  to think back to that hour  at least  this was doing something  getting somewhere  she had telegraphed to every  one she could think of  but no reply had come up to the time the train  started  she reasoned that out with herself  now for good  now for bad   and then  if he were better  if there were anything good to tell      her temples were thumping more loudly than the train thumped  her heart  was choking her  her throat was so tight she could not breathe  again and  again she went over it to herself  dr  parkman had operated on karl  of  course dr  parkman would do it right  he would not dare to operate on him  without her being there unless he was absolutely sure it would be all  right  and then close upon that  he would have waited for her if      appendicitis  that was what those quick operations were  and most of  them  especially with dr  parkman  came out all right  and karl was the  doctor s best friend  would not a man save his best friend when he could  save every one else  and karl himself  his will  his power  his love for  her  why karl would  know  that nothing must happen while she was away   but close upon that came awful visions  oh  why  had dr  parkman sent  her away and then done this thing  she would tell him when she got  there  she would tell him      it would all be right when she got there  if only the train would hurry   there was smoke off there  was it   it  was  the smoke of chicago   nothing had ever looked so beautiful before  very soon now  why  perhaps  within a few hours she and karl would be laughing at this   isn t it  great the way i got on  liebchen   he would say   isn t parkman a dandy      they were passing those houses on the outskirts  oh why was chicago so  big  but she must be calm  very calm  she must not excite karl in the  least  how sorry he would be that she had been frightened like this  they  were passing larger buildings  coming closer to the city  she gritted her  teeth hard  clenched her hands     karl was at the hospital  the telegram told that  she would get off at  the stop just this side of the main station  that was a little nearer the  hospital  she believed  she would take a cab  if only there were an  automobile   but the cabman would surely go very fast if she told him why  she had to hurry like this     long before the train came to its stop she was standing at the door  she  would not have waited for the standstill if the porter had not held her  back  oh how she must hurry now     she ran to the nearest cabman  would he hurry very fast   faster than he  ever had before  it was life and death  it was   yes  yes  lady   he  said  putting her in   yes  i understand  i ll hurry       but faster   she kept saying to him   oh  please   faster      she saw nothing either to the right or left  she saw only the straight  line ahead which they must travel  and still everything from within her  was pushing her on  oh if the man would only  hurry      a big building at last  the hospital  only two blocks now  then one  and  then the man had slowed up  she was out before he stopped  running up the  steps  somebody in the hospital would pay  and up the stairs  the  elevator was there  but her own feet would take her faster      dr  hubers   where is he   she said in choked voice to a nurse in the  hall     the nurse started to speak  but ernestine  looking ahead  saw dr  parkman  standing in the door of a room  she rushed to him with outstretched hand   white  questioning  pleading face  her lips refused to move           chapter xxxvi      with the outgoing tide    he simply took her into the room  and there was karl  alive  that was all  she grasped at first  it filled her so completely she could take in  nothing else  he was lying there  seemingly half asleep  looking much as  he always did  save that of course it was plain he was very sick  she  stooped down and kissed him  and his face lighted up  and he smiled a  little   ernestine   he murmured   did they frighten you      it was as she had known  his thought was of her  and oh how sorry karl  would be when he was quite well and she told him all     she nestled her head close to him  her arm thrown about him  the  tears were running down her cheeks  of the blessedness of finding karl  here  breathing  smiling upon her  sorry she had been frightened  she  took his hand and it responded to her clasp  that thrilled her through  and through  those awful fears  those never to be forgotten fears  that  karl s hand might never close over hers again  she leaned over him that  she might feel his breath upon her face  in all her life there had never  been so blessed a joy as this feeling karl s breath upon her cheek   nothing mattered now  work  eyes  nothing  she had him back  she asked  nothing more of life  what could anything else matter now that those  awful fears had drawn away  she was sobbing quietly to herself  again his  hand closed over hers     then something made her look up  and at the foot of the bed she saw dr   parkman  one look at his face and she grew cold from head to foot  her  throat grew painfully tight  strange things came before her eyes  she  could not move  she simply remained there upon her knees  looking at dr   parkman s face  her own frozen with terror     the doctor came to her  took her hands  and helped her to rise  two  nurses and another doctor were bending over karl  doing something  dr   parkman led ernestine into an adjoining room     she did not take her eyes from his face  the appeal  terror  in them  seemed to strike him dumb  it was as though his own throat were closed   for several times he tried vainly to speak      ernestine   he said at last   karl is very sick       how  sick   she managed to whisper      how  sick   she repeated as he stood there looking at her helplessly     and  finally  he said  as if it were killing him to do it   so sick  that        don t say that    she fairly hissed it at him      don t  dare  say that  you  did  it  you      and then  sinking down  beside him  catching hold of his hand  she sobbed out  wildly   heartbreakingly   oh  dr  parkman  oh  please   please  tell me you   will  save karl      her sobs were becoming uncontrollable   ernestine   he said  sharply   be  quiet  be quiet  you have got to help      the sobs stopped  she rose to her feet  he pulled up a chair for her  but  she did not sit down  a few sobs still came  but her face was becoming  stern  set      tell me   she said  holding her two hands tight against her breast  and  looking him straight in the face     and then he jerked it out  karl had been taken ill  pain  fever  he  feared appendicitis  he had two other doctors see him  they agreed  that he must be operated on immediately  they brought him here  they  found  conditions awful  they did all that surgery could do  every known  thing was being done now  but  they did not know  he had rallied a little  from the operation  now he seemed to be drooping  he was in bad shape  generally   heart weakened by the shock of his blindness  intestines  broken down by lack of exercise  whole system affected by changed  conditions  all these things combined against him  he told the short  story with his own lips white  swaying a little  seeming fairly to age as  he stood there     her face had been changing as she listened  he had never seen a human  face look as hers did then  he had never heard a human voice sound as  hers sounded when she said   dr  parkman  you are mistaken   she looked  him straight in the eye  a look which held the whole force of her being    i say you are mistaken  we will go back in here now to karl  you and i  together are going to save him      there was the light from higher worlds in her eye as she went back  in  her voice a force which men have never named or understood  and something  which emanated from her took hold of every one who came into that room   there was more than the resources of medical science at work now     on her knees beside the bed  her arm about him  passionately shielding  him from the dark forces around him  her face often touching his as if  reassuring him  ernestine spoke to karl  quietly  tenderly  forcefully   love s own intuition telling her how much to say  when to speak  by her  warm body which loved him  by her great spirit which claimed him  she  would hold him from the outgoing tide  her voice could rouse him where  other stimulants failed  the only effort he made was the tightening of  his hand over hers  and sometimes he smiled a little as he felt her close  to him     two hours went by  the lines in dr  parkman s face were deepening  they  worked on unfalteringly  hypodermics  heat  rubbing  oxygen  all those  things with which man seeks to deceive himself  and for which the foe   with the tolerance of power  is willing to wait  but their faces were  changing  the call of the outgoing tide  that tide over which human  determination has not learned to prevail  was coming close  they worked  on  for they were trained to work on  even through the sense of their own  futility     looking about her ernestine saw it all  and held him with a passionate  protectiveness  if all else failed  her arms  arms to which he had ever  come for help and consolation  could surely hold him  the cold fear crept  farther and farther into her heart  and as it crept on her arms about him  tightened  not while she held him like this  oh not while she held him  like this     and then a frenzy possessed her  that she should sit here  powerless  weeping  despairing  surrendering  while karl slipped  from her  she must do something  say something  something to hold him  firm  call him back  make him understand that he must fight     suddenly a light broke over her face  she looked at dr  parkman  who was  bending over karl   i will tell him   she whispered   what i did  the  secret  about the work      he hesitated  medically his judgment was against it  and then  white to  the lips with the horror of the admission he faced the fact that this had  passed beyond things medical  let her try where he had failed  through a  rush of uncontrollable tears he nodded yes     and she did tell him   in words which were not sentences  with  sharp flashes of thought  such flashes as alone could penetrate the  semi consciousness into which she must reach  after a moment of pause in  which to gather herself together for the great battle of her life  with  concentration  illumination  with a piercing eloquence which brought hot  tears to every cheek  and deep  deep prayers to hearts which would have  said they did not know how to pray  a woman fighting for the man she  loved  human love at its whitest heat pitted against destiny  she told  him      karl   at the last   you  understand    that s the great  secret    that s  the great picture  i ve not painted one stroke this  winter  i ve been working for  you   working in your laboratory every  day  studying day and night  getting ready to be your eyes  going to give  you back your work  oh  karl   karl   won t you    but the sobs could  hold back no longer     she had reached him  he took it in  just a little at first  but  comprehension was growing  and upon his face a great wondering  a  softening      old man    it was dr  parkman now   you get that  see what you ve got  ahead  god  man  but it was splendid  she came to me with the idea   her   idea  thought it all out herself  karl was not happy  karl must have his  work  karl  karl  it was nothing but karl  she was closer to him than any  one in the world  she could make him see what others could not  then   she  would be his eyes  man  do you know that this woman has fairly made  over her soul for love of you  do you know that she has given up becoming  one of the great painters of the world to become your assistant  do you  get it  karl  so help me god it was the pluckiest fight i ve ever seen or  heard of  and she s won  i m no fool  and i say she can do what she says  she can  she s ready  she s ready to begin to morrow  what do you say   old man  what do you think of ernestine now  isn t she worth taking a  good brace and living for      and then he got it all  he was taking it in  rising to it  understanding   glowing  and a look that was very wonderful was growing upon karl s face      ernestine   he whispered  dwelling long upon the name  his voice a voice  of wonder   you did that  for me       i did it because i love you so   she whispered  and it seemed that  surely death itself could not withstand the tenderness of it     and then his whole face became transfigured  his blind eyes were opened  to the light of love  his illumined face reflected it as the supreme  moment of his life  in that moment he triumphed over all powers set  against him  he rose out of suffering on wings of glory  he transcended  sorrow and tragedy  blindness  yes  in that moment  death  he saw behind  the veil  he saw into the glory of a soul  he comprehended the wonder of  love  compensation for suffering and loss  understanding  victory  peace   it was the human face lighted with divine light  they did not dare to  move or breathe as they looked upon the wonder of his face      ernestine  little one   he whispered  the light not going from his  face   you loved me  like that       you see  karl    it was this must reach him   what you have to live for  now      but he did not get that  he was filled with the wonder of that which he  was seeing      you see  old man   said parkman  sharply   what you ve got ahead of  you      but he only murmured  happily  faintly  as one about to fall asleep   she  loved me  like that      it terrified her  it seemed  not as though the great idea were holding  him  but as though he were taking it away with him  even as though well  content to go  having this to take with him from life      karl  karl   she sobbed   don t you  see  how i love you   don t you see  you  must  live now  for me      but he had far transcended all sense of suffering or loss  even her  suffering and loss  her plea  she herself  could not reach him  he and  the great idea were going away together  and that light did not leave his  face     it was so that he sank into a sleep  he did not hear ernestine s sobs  he  knew nothing of her pleading cries  in a frenzy of grief she felt him  going out to where she could not reach him  she called to him  and he did  not answer  she pressed close to him  and he did not know that she was  there     but the great idea was with him  it lighted his face to the last  it was  as if that were what he was taking with him from life  it was as if that   and that alone  he could keep      karl  karl   she cried  terrorised   look at me  speak to me  i am here   ernestine is here    and then  the strongest word of woman to man   i m  frightened  oh take care of me  karl  take care of me      dr  parkman tried to take her away  but she resisted fiercely  and they  let her stay  and during the few hours which followed she never ceased  her pleading  to him to come back to her  to them to help  crazed with  the consciousness of his slipping from her  wild beyond all reason with  the thought that her kisses could not move him  her arms could not hold  him  her passion lashed to the uttermost in the thought that she must  claim him now or lose him forever  she pleaded with all the eloquence of  human voice and human tears  she could not believe it  that he was there  beside her and would not listen to her pleadings  again and again she  told him that she was frightened and alone  that  surely that  he must  hear  it could not be that he was there beside her  breathing  moving a  little now and then  and did not hear her call for help     and when at last she heard some one speak a low word  and saw some one  bend over him to close his eyes  she uttered one piercing  heartbreaking  cry which they would bear with them so long as they lived  and then   throwing herself upon him  shielding him  keeping him  there came the  wild  futile call of life to death   karl   karl    karl             part three          chapter xxxvii      beneath dead leaves    the cold march rain drove steadily against the car window  his thoughts  were like that   cold  ugly  driving thoughts  looking out at the bleak  country through which they were passing he saw that dead leaves were  hanging forlornly to bare trees  his hopes were like that   a few dead  hopes clinging dismally to the barren tree of experience  so it seemed to  dr  parkman as he looked from the car window at the country of hills and  hollows through which he was passing  the out lived winter s snow still  in the hollows  last summer s leaves blown meaninglessly about  denied  even the repose of burial  the cheerless wind and the cheerless rain  it  matched his mood     almost a year had gone by  and dr  parkman was going out to see  ernestine  every mile which brought him nearer  brought added uncertainty  as to what he should say when he reached her  what was there for him to  say  the dead leaves of her hopes were all huddled in the hollow  was he  becoming so irrational as to think he could give life to things dead  was  she not right in wishing to cover them up decently and let them be  was  anything to be gained in blowing them about as last summer s leaves were  being blown about now by the unsparing  uncaring winds of march     she was out where she had lived as a girl   living in the very house  which had once been her home  he had understood her going  it was the  simple law of living things  the animal wounded beyond all thought of  life seeks only a place of seclusion     but when georgia returned from her visit to ernestine the month before   she came to him with      dr  parkman  you  must  do something for ernestine   and after she had  told him many things  and he questioned still further  she said  in  desperate desire to make it plain   she is becoming a great deal like  you      and from then until the time of starting on this trip he had had no  peace     he understood  understood far more deeply than she who would have him  see  was any one better qualified to understand that thing than he     well   what then  what now  was there any other thing to expect  was he   of all men  going to her with platitudes about courage and faith  and  even so  would sophistry avail anything  did he not know ernestine far  too well far that     his own face bore the deep marks of hard and bitter things  but the loss  and the sorrow showed themselves in strange ways  little understood as  manifestations of grief  he ran his automobile faster  showed even less  caution than before in his business ventures  had less and less to say   was called more and more strange by those associated with him  and the  thing which mocked him most of all was that the year had been attended  with the greatest professional successes of his life  he never heard his  plaudits sounded without a curse in his heart      it went mighty hard with parkman not to be able to save hubers   medical  men said with growing frequency as the year advanced  but there were none  of them who dreamed into what deep and vital things the cut had gone   with his own will and his own skill he patched it up on the surface  not  the man to leave his wound exposed to other eyes  but he knew its  hopelessness too well ever to try and reach the bottom of the wound  it  was not a good  clean  straight cut such as time expects to heal  indeed  it was not a cut at all  nothing so wholesome and reachable as that  it  was a destroying force  a thing burrowing at the springs of life  a thing  which made its way through devious paths to vital sources  did a patched  up surface mean anything to a thing like that     the evening of the day he had seen georgia  and she told him of  ernestine  he sat a long time in his office alone  the grey ashes of his  own life seemed spread around him  and it was he  who was asked  out of  this  to rekindle a great flame  and what flame  what was there left for  ernestine  ask her to come back  to what  fight  for what     he did not know  or at least he said he did not know  and yet he  like  georgia  saw it as all wrong  unendurable  not to be countenanced  that  ernestine should shut herself out from life     perhaps he was going to her because he knew so well the desolation of  ashes  was it because he had lived so long among them that he hated to  see another fire go out  could it be that a man who had dwelt long among  ashes knew most surely the worth of the flame     he had reached the end of his journey  he had come to the western college  town for which he had set out  from the window he could see some of the  college buildings  yes  this was the place     he rose and put on his coat  a few minutes later he was standing on the  station platform  watching the on going train  then he turned  with  decision  in the direction georgia had bade him go           chapter xxxviii      patchwork quilts    and now that the first ten minutes had passed he felt anew the futility  of his errand  his first look into her face made him certain he might  better have remained in chicago  the thing which cut off all approach was  that she too had done some work on the surface     it seemed to him as he sat there in utter silence that he had been  brutal  not alone to her heart  but to his own  that he asked too much   not only of her command  but of his  he had come to talk of ernestine and  the future  the things about him drew him overmasteringly to karl and the  past     she had taken him to her little sitting room up stairs  forced to do so  because the fire down stairs had gone out  he understood now why it was  she had faltered so in asking him to come up here  here was karl s big  chair  many things from their library at home  it was where she lived  with her past  she wanted no one here     she would make no attempt at helping him  she sat there in silence  her  face white  almost stern  in her aloofness it was as though she were  trying to hold herself  from the consciousness of his presence     he too remained silent  for he was filled with the very things against  which he had come to protest     it was karl who was very close  it was the thoughts of karl s life which  filled him  his heart had never been so warm for his friend  his  appreciation had never been so great as now  karl  and all that karl  meant  had never been so close  and so dear  and the words he finally  said to ernestine  words of passionate tenderness spoken in utter  unconsciousness of how far he had gone from his purpose  were   i do not  believe any of us half appreciated karl      startled  she gave him a long  strange look   no  dr  parkman    very  low   neither do i       i have been looking into it since  i wanted to throw karl s results to  the right man  he was head and shoulders above them all      there was a slow closing of her eyes  but she was not shrinking from him  now   this the kind of hurt she was able to bear      if he had been left to work out his life    but he stopped  brought  suddenly to a sense of how far he had lost himself     she too saw it   dr  parkman    with a smile which put him far from  her    this  is what you came to say  you think  i  need any incitement   you needn t  dr  parkman    with rising passion   you needn t  every  time i leave this room two things are different  i have more love for  karl  more hate for his destroyers  and those two passions will feed upon  me to the end of my life      instinctively he put out a protesting hand  it was too plain that it was  as she said      more love for karl  more hate for his destroyers    she repeated it with  a passionate steadfastness as though it comprehended the creed of her  life      his  destroyers   he faltered   what do you mean  by that      and she answered  with a directness before which dissembling and evasion  crumbled away   read the answer in your own heart      and if you cannot look into your own heart   she went on  unsparingly    if your own heart has been shut away so long that it is closed even to  yourself  then look into your looking glass and read the answer there   let the grey hairs in your own head  the lines in your own face   yes   the words of your own mouth  tell you what you would know of karl s  destroyers      he drew in his lips in that way of his  one side of his face twitched  uncontrollably  he had come to reach her soul  reach it if must be  through channels of suffering  he had not thought of her reaching his  like this     but she could not stop   and if you want to know what i have gone  through  look back to what you have gone through yourself  then make  some of those hours just as much stronger as love is stronger than  friendship  and perhaps you can get some idea of what it has been to me      he was dumb before that  putting it that way there was not a word to say     he saw now the real change  it was more than hollowed cheeks and eyes  from which the light of other days had gone  more than soft curves  surrendered to grief and youth eaten out by bitterness  it was a change  at the root of things  a great tide had been turned the other way  but in  the days when happiness softened her and love made it all harmonious he  had never felt her force as he felt it now  reach this  turn this  the  moment brought new understanding of the paltriness of words     it was she who spoke   dr  parkman    looking at him with a keenness in  which there was almost an affectionate understanding   you did not say  what you intended to say when you came into this room  you intended to  speak of me  but the room swept you back to karl  oh  i know  and it is  just because you  were  swept back  care like this  that i am going to  tell you something      doctor    blinded with tears   we never understood  none of us ever knew  what it meant to karl to be blind  after  after he had gone  i found  something  in this book   reaching over to karl s copy of faust   i found  a letter  a very long letter karl wrote in those last few days  when he  was there  alone  i found it the day i went out to the library alone  the  day before they  broke it up  oh doctor   what it told   i want you to  know    but she could not go on     when she raised her head the fierce light of hate was burning through the  tears   can you fancy how i hate the light  can you fancy with what  feelings i wake in the morning and see it come  light from which karl was  shut out  which he craved like that  and could not have  do you see how  it symbolises all those other things taken from him and me  he talked of  another light  light he must gain for himself  light which the soul must  have  and karl was longing for the very light i was ready to bring  he  would have believed in it  turned to it eagerly  the letter shows that   do you  wonder  that there is nothing but darkness in my soul  that i  want nothing else  look at karl s life  always cut off just this side of  achievement  every battle stopped right in the hour of victory  made  great only to have his greatness buffetted about like   held up for  sport    i  will  say it     in fierce response to his protesting  gesture   it s true      he tried to speak  but this was far too big for words which did not come  straight from the soul      do you know what i am doing now   she laughed  and none of it had told  as much as that laugh revealed   i am making patchwork quilts  can  you fancy anything more worthless in this world than a patchwork  quilt   cutting things up and then sewing them together again  and making  them uglier in the end than they were in the beginning  do you know  anything more futile to do with life than that  well that s where my  life is now  my aunt had begun some  and i am finishing them up  and  once  once    but the sob in her voice gathered up the words     he wanted to speak then  that sob brought her nearer  but she went on      i sit sewing those little pieces together  a foolish thing to do  but  one must be doing something  and as i think how useless it is there comes  the thought of whether it is any more useless than all the other things  in life  is it any more useless than surgery  for can a great surgeon  save his best friend  is it any more useless than science  for can  science do anything for her own  is it any more useless than ambition and  purpose and hope  for does not fate make sport of them all  is it any  more useless than books  for can books reach the hearts which need them  most  is it any more useless than art  for does art reach realities  is  it any more useless than light  for can light penetrate the real  darkness  is it    she wavered  quivered  she had been talking in low   quick voice  her eyes fixed on something straight ahead  as though  reading her words out there before her  and now  as she held back  and he  saw what she saw and could not say  he asked for her  slowly   is it any  more useless than love            chapter xxxix      ash heap and rose jar    as she broke then to the sobs for which he had hoped  something of  tremendous force stirred within the man  and he felt that if he could  bring her from the outer darkness where she had been carried  back to the  things which were her soul s own  that his own life  his whole life  with  all of the dark things through which it had passed  would have found  justification  he had tried to save karl  and failed  but there was left  ernestine  and it seemed to him  he saw it simply  directly   unquestioningly  that after all he would not have failed karl if he could  do what it was in his heart to do now for her     looking at her bowed head he saw it all  the complete overthrow  the rich  field of life rendered barren waste  barren waste  but was that true for  ernestine  did there not remain for her the scent of the field  the  memory of that glorious  luxuriant growth  with  him  barren waste  but  for her did there not grow in the field of life some things which were  everlasting  with the quickness with which he saw everything he saw that  it was the picture of his own barrenness could show her most surely the  things which for her remained     he drew back from the thought as one draws away from the rude touch upon  a wound  lay bare the scars of his life that another profit by their  ugliness  years of habit were against it  everything fundamentally  himself was against it  but he was a man who had never yet shrunk from  the thing he saw was right to do  the cost of an accomplishment never  deterred him from a thing he saw must be accomplished  with each second  of listening to her sobs  he was becoming once more the man who masters   the man ruthless and unsparing in his purposefulness      ernestine   he began  and his voice was very strange  for it knew it was  to carry things it had never carried before   you and i are similarly  placed in that we have both lost the great thing of life  but there is  something remains to each of us  life has left something to us both  to  you it has left a rose jar  to me  a heap of ashes      it came with the moment s need  it comprehended it so well the channels  long closed seemed of themselves to open  in the clearness with which he  saw it  the fullness with which he felt it  he lost himself      do you know that you have no right to cry out against life  do you know  that there are men and women who would lay down their lives  yes  and  give up their immortal souls  for hours which you have had  do you know  that you have no right to say karl hubers was mocked by fate  made sport  of  buffetted about  do you know    his face went white as he said this   slowly   that i would be a thousand times willing to give up my two  eyes  yes  and lay down my life  just to  know   as he knew  that love  was great and life was good      the tears remained undried upon her cheek  he held her      look deeper  there is another way to read karl s life  a deeper truth  than those truths you have been seeing      ernestine  we all dream of love  we all desire it  it is only at rare   rare times it comes as it came to you  and i say to you  and i mean it  from the bottom of my heart  that if you had been forced to give up your  love in the first hour of its fulfillment  for all that you should thank  god through the remainder of your life that it had been yours  for you   had  it   and nothing  loss  death  defeat  disappointment of every  kind  can strip from your soul the consciousness that once  no matter for  how short a time  love in its fullness and perfection was yours  long   lonely years may come  and all hard things may come  but through it all  the thing to keep your soul in tune is the memory of some one perfect  hour      stillness followed that  the stillness which was silence  she had not  moved      you dreamed your dream    and in his voice now the beautiful things of  appreciation and understanding   i know your dream  you dreamed of  growing old together  of taking from life everything there was together   of achieving to the uttermost  of rejoicing in each other s victories   growing more and more close together  i know your dream  a beautiful  dream  giving up some things as the changing years do their work  and  taking on the other things  the more quiet  in fact finer things  that  come with the years  oh  yes  don t think i do not know that dream  to  walk together down the years  meet them fearlessly  gladly  in the  thought that they but add to the fullness of your love  i know  i know   and now that it is not to be as you thought  you say life has left  nothing to you  that you hate it  will have none of it  oh  ernestine  if  you could only know how rich you are      then harshly  rudely  the change  the voice which had seemed to caress  each word was now like a lash      suppose you didn t have the luxury of giving yourself up to your own  heart  suppose that every day and night of your life  you had to fight  memory  knowing it held nothing for you but jeers and mockery and things  too damnable for words  suppose you had to fairly forbid yourself to  think of the beautiful things of life  suppose that what had been the  most beautiful moments of your life were made  by memory  the most  hideous  suppose the memory of his kiss always brought with it the  consciousness of his falseness  that his words of love never came back to  you without the knowledge that he had been laughing at you in his heart  all the time  suppose you could never get away from the damning truth  that what you gave from the depth of your heart was tossed aside with a  laugh  suppose you had given the great passion of your life  the best  that was in you  to a liar and a hypocrite  suppose you had been made a  fool of   easy game   then  what of life   your belief in love   thoughts  of fate  great god  woman  can t you see what you have got      after the throbbing moment which followed that there came a great quiet   slowly passion settled to sadness  he seemed to have forgotten her  to be  speaking instead to his own heart  as he said  very low  his voice  touched with the tenderness of unrelinquished dreams   to have had one  hour  just one perfect hour  and then the memory of that untarnished  forever  it would be enough      her heart rushed passionately to its own defence  she wanted to tell him  no  she wanted to tell him it was cruel to be permitted to live for a  time in a beautiful country  only to be turned out into the dark  she  wanted to tell him that to know love was to need it forever  but his head  had fallen to his hand  he seemed entirely lost to her  and even now she  knew his answer to what she would say   but you  had  it   he would  reply   the cruel thing would be to awaken and find no such country had  ever existed   they would get no closer than that  and with new  passionateness her heart went out to karl  karl would understand it as it  was to her     he too felt that they could come no closer than this  they sat there in  the gathering twilight with their separate thoughts as souls sit together  almost in the dark  seeing one another in shadow  across dim spaces     the tearing open of his heart had left him weakened with pain  perhaps  that was why he was so very tired  and perhaps it was because he was so  tired that this thought of growing old came back to him  it seemed to him  now  leaning back in his chair and filled with the things of which he had  spoken  that almost as great as a living presence with which to share the  years  would be that thing of growing old with a beautiful memory  it  would be a supreme thing to have a hand in your hand  a face against your  face  a heart against your heart as you stepped on into the years  but if  that could not be  and perfection is not given freely in this life   surely it would keep the note of cheer in one s voice  the kindly  gleam in one s eye  to bring with one into old age the memory of a  perfect love  it would be lonely then when one sat in the twilight and  dreamed  but what another loneliness  if instead of holding one s self  away from one s own heart  one could turn to it with   she loved me like  that  her arms have been about my neck in true affection  her whole being  radiated love for me  she had no words to tell it and could tell it only  with her eyes and with the richness and the lavishness of her kisses  she  would have given up the world for me  she inspired me to my best deeds   she comforted me in my times of discouragement and rejoiced with me in my  hours of cheer  she is not here now  and it is lonely  but she has left  me  in spirit  the warmth of her presence  the consciousness that she  loved me with a love in which there was no selfishness nor faltering  and  the things she has left me i can carry through life and into eternity      and all of that was ernestine s could she but see her way to take it     he knew that it was growing late   i must go   he said  but still he sat  there  knowing he had not finished what he had come to say  but need he  say it  would it avail anything  must not all human souls work their own  way through the darkness  and when the right word came  must it not come  from karl himself  through some memory  some strange breath of the  spirit   he  knew  but she would have to see it for herself  that each  one s seeing it for one s self was what made life hard  would there not  surely come a day  somewhere in the upward scale  where souls could reach  one another better than this     but he had stirred her  he knew that by the way she was looking at him  now  finally she asked  tremblingly  a little resentfully   dr  parkman   what is it you would have me do       do something with your life   was his prompt reply   help make it right  for karl      she caught that up breathlessly   make it right for karl       you say he was always cut off just this side of achievement  then you  achieve something which will at least show what he was able to inspire      that sunk so deep that her face went very white      but you do not understand   she whispered passionately   you mean that i  should paint  and i tell you i  cannot   i tell you it is  dead        not necessarily that you should paint  not just now  if you cannot  but  come back into touch with life  do something to force yourself back into  it  and then let life itself show you that the other things are not dead  after all       but i do not want to   came bitterly from her      sometimes   he said  with more of his usual manner   we do things we do  not want to  and through the doing of them  we get to want to  do  something   whether you want to or not  stop doing futile things and  dwelling on the sense of their futility  why  ernestine  come up to the  hospital and go to work as a nurse  heaven knows i never expected to  advise you to do that  but  anything   painting pictures or scrubbing  floors  that will bring you back to a sense of living  the obligations of  life  show you that something is  yours  that life and death and  hell   can t take from you      and still he sat there  thinking  in just a moment he must go  go away  leaving her alone with the years which awaited her  for just an instant  it seemed as though all of the past and all of the future were in his  keeping  what word leave with her  he knew by her passionate breathing  that he had reached her  and now he was going away  could he have done  more  reached deeper  in this  too  had he failed  what word leave with  her  his heart was so full of many things that his mind did not know what  to choose  he remembered the day she had come to him filled with the  spirit to ride down an adverse fate and win triumph from defeat  her  splendid spirit then  would that spirit ever come again  could it     karl was very close in those final moments  and even more close than karl  was the spirit of love  many precious things seemed in his keeping just  then      ernestine   he said at the last  and his face was white and his voice  trembled   you have known  it came to you  you had it  it came to you as  june to the roses   in season  right  i grant you it was short  i grant  you it was hard to see it go  but you  had  it  say that to yourself when  you go to sleep at night  say it to yourself when you wake in the  morning  and some day you will come to see what it means just to know  that you know  and then your understanding and your heart will go out to  all who have never known  you will pity all who scoff and all who yearn   and you will say to yourself   the world needs to know more about love   more than knowledge or science or any other thing  the world needs more  faith in love   then some day you will see that you not only know but  have power to make it plain  and you will not hold back any longer then   and  there  is to be the real victory and completion of karl hubers   life   there the real triumph over fate  that triumph of the spirit of  love  i see it now  i see it all now  and my good bye word to you is just  this  i do not believe you are going to withhold from karl the  immortality which should be his            chapter xl       let there be light     hours had passed  and still she could not master the sobs  it seemed no  one had ever been as cruel as dr  parkman had been to her that afternoon   karl would understand   and in her passionate need of karl s  understanding she turned at last to the letter of which she had spoken   the letter which always seemed a little like karl s voice speaking from  out the silence     old and worn and blurred with the grief spent upon it  the letter bore  upon itself the record of the year s desolation  it had lived through  things never to be told   never to be comprehended      lonesome days  liebchen    he had written   it would seem almost like a  rush of light to feel you standing in the doorway now      my letters which i send you will tell you i am well  getting along all  right  that i love you  these are some other things  if i think they will  hurt you  i will not let you see them  but i will feel better to get them  said  and of course the easiest way to say them is to say them to you      i can t write  i wish i could  there are things  way back in my thoughts  i should like to say  and say right  for i ve done some thinking this  year  liebchen  while i sat here writing text books there came a good  many thoughts      text books  any fool can write them  lectures on what other men have  done  what do i care about them  i ll do it  for i have to  but i want  somebody to know  i want  you  to know that i know it doesn t amount to a  hill of beans      liebchen  you hear a lot of talk about the beauties of resignation   don t you ever believe any of it  we don t get resigned to things that  really count  but what we do get  is courage to bear them  i m not  resigned and i don t want to be  but i will try to be game about it  and  we can t be game while we are sore  i know that because the times i ve  been least game are the times i was most sore  wonder if anybody can make  any sense out of that      life s queer  you can t get around that  making us one thing and then  making us be another  what are we to think of it  liebchen  seems as if  we could get on better if we could just get a line on the scheme of  things  understand what it is all about  and the why  or isn t there any  why  i like a why for things  it gives them their place  i don t like  disorder  and senselessness  and if there isn t any why  why then  see  what i m getting at      what are you going to do when your force pushes you on to a thing which  is closed to you  stop the force  well  doesn t that stop yourself  turn  it somewhere else  easy to say in working out a philosophy   not so easy  to do      where s the end of it   that s what i want to know  i m one of those  practical chaps who wants to see an end in sight      ernestine  light s a great thing  light s  the  great thing  i never  knew that until i went blind  you have to stay a long time in the  darkness to know just what it is light means      they call great men  great lights    and then came the light   they say   regarding the solving of some great thing   he brought the light   that s  what i wanted to do  they tell about science bringing the light  i know  now what a tribute they pay when they say that  light of understanding   light of truth  and ah  mein liebchen  the light of love  and well do i  know how that light can shine into the darkness       more light   goethe said  when he was going out into the dark  a great  thing to ask for  i know how he felt    and god said  let there be  light   i don t wonder that story has lived a long time      my books are finished  now what   more books   lectures   some kind of  old woman s make shift  sit here and watch my red blood dry up  sit here  like a plant shrivelling away in the darkness  be looked after and fussed  over and have things made as easy for me as possible  i don t know  i  can t see       there  liebchen  i ve taken a brace  i took a long drink of courage  and  i m in better shape  often when i get like that i ve been tempted to take  a long drink of something else  but i never have  whiskey s for men who  feel good  men who haven t much to fight  not for me  not any such finish  as that      i m making bad business of this letter  i wanted to tell things  tell  what light was and what darkness was  but i can t do it  many things have  been circling around my thoughts and i thought i might get hold of a few  of them and pull them in  but i can t seem to do it  i never was much  good at writing things out  it s hard to get words for things that aren t  even full born thoughts      my work was great  liebchen  great  a constant piercing of the darkness  with light  a letting in of more light  new light  i can understand now  why i loved it  where the joy was  what it was i was doing      is life like that  don t we understand things until we are out of them   by jove  is it true that we have to  get  out of them  in order to  understand them  and if that s true  is it the understanding that s the  goal  is it  oh  i don t know  i m sure i don t know      but look here  liebchen   is it true that while i had the light  i  didn t have it at all   didn t know what it meant  did i have to lose it  in order to get it  for isn t it  having  a thing to understand it  more  than it s having it to really have it and not understand  see what i  mean  those are some of the things circling around on the outside      sometimes i think so  sometimes i think the light was shut out that the  greater light might come  sometimes i think we scientists haven t the  right line on the world at all  why  ernestine  sometimes i think it s  miles deeper than we ever dreamed  a hodge podge  this letter  like my  life  starting out one thing  and ending up another  or rather not ending  up anything at all  a going to pieces in the midst of my philosophy  a  not being sure of anything  a constant  perhaps        i m lonesome  i m tired  i don t feel well  the old ladies would say i m   under the weather   why  i can t even keep feeling right when you re  away      i want you  i want you  here  now  i can t talk to you on this infernal  machine  my hands groping around just as senselessly as my thoughts  i  tell you  liebchen  blindness is bad business  it sounds well in a poem   but it s a bad thing to live with  it s bad to wake up in the night  sometimes and think that it will be daylight soon and then remember that  it will never be daylight for you again      i wish you were here  i m just in the mood for talking  not talking   perhaps  but having you close to me  and understanding      there s one thing that there s no perhaps about  that s you  there s no  perhaps when it comes to our love  there s no perhaps       now  that made me fall a dreaming  i stopped writing and lighted my pipe  and sat a long time  thinking of you  it s  our hour   i know that   because i heard the clock strike  where are you  why aren t you here      i want you  believe i said that before  but if i said it a thousand  times  i couldn t make it strong enough  i don t know why i want you like  this  this soul want  it isn t just your kisses  your sweetness  the dear  things about you  i want you to be here to understand  for you would  you  do      my light in the darkness  my ernestine  i shall never let you go away  again  the darkness is too dark without you      evening now  for again i stopped  too tired  too quiet  someway  to feel  like writing  i am going to bed  i wish you were here for your good night  kiss  i wish you were here just to tell me that you understand all these  things i have not been able to say  i wish you were here to tell me  what  in my heart i know  that you are going to bring me the light  that love  will light the way  i wish you were here to tell me that what my eyes  cannot tell you  as they used to  you can read now just by the beating of  my heart  just through the fullness of our silences      oh  little one  your eyes  your dear eyes  your lovely hair  your  smile  your arms about my neck  your whispered word in my ear  your soft  cheek against mine  your laugh  your voice  your tenderness  i want it  all to night  and the ernestine of the silences  the ernestine who  understands without knowing  helps without trying      soon you will be back  that will be sunrise after long darkness      good night  it s hard to leave you  so lonesome  wanting you so  again   good night  dear girl for whom my arms are yearning  bless you   sweetheart  god bless you  and does god  himself  know what you have been  to me      she read the last of it  as always  with sobs uncontrollable  dr   parkman  everything  was forgotten  it was karl alone in the library   longing for her  needing her  and she not there      oh  karl  karl   she sobbed across the black chasm of the year   if i  could only have had that hour            chapter xli      when the tide came in    but the days which came then were different  dr  parkman had stirred her  to a discontent with despair     she had come west with georgia and joe  for five days they had been at  this little town on the oregon coast  through the day and through the  night she listened to the call of the sea  it stirred her strangely  at  times it frightened her     she did not know why she should have wished to come  perhaps it was  because it seemed a reaching out to the unknown  after she had known  she was to go  she would awaken in the night and hear the far off  roll of the pacific  and would lie there very still as if listening  for something from the farther unknown  her whole being was  stirred  drawn  unreasoningly expectant  there were moments when she  seemed to just miss something to which she was very close     to day she had walked clear around the bend  the little town and pleasant  beach were hidden from view  and there was only the lighthouse out among  the rocks  and the sea coming in wild and mighty to that coast to which  no mariner would attempt to draw near     it was the hour of the in coming tide  and as the sea beat against the  rocks it seemed as omnipotent and relentless as that sea of fate against  which nothing erected by man could hope to prevail     there was no human being in sight  man  and all to which man blinded one   were far away  she was alone with things as they were  alone with the  forces which made the world and life  and as the tides of the sea brought  close to her wave after wave  so the mind s tides were bringing close to  her wave upon wave of understanding     fate had washed them away just as this ocean would wash away the child s  playhouse built upon the sands  they had believed they could make their  lives  that it was for their spirit to elect what they should do  their  hands build as they had willed  and all that the spirit had willed to do   and all that the hands set about to achieve  was washed away by just one  of those waves of fate which rolled in and took them with no more of  regret  no more of compassion  than the sea would have in washing away  the play house built upon the sands  and if the sea were chidden for  having taken away the house upon the sands  which meant much to some one   it would quite likely answer grimly   i did not know that it was there      she laughed  and karl would have hated life for bringing ernestine to  that laugh  but she laughed to think how she had looked fate in the face  with the words   i will prevail against you   would the child  building  its house upon the sand and saying to the ocean   i will not let you take  my house   be more absurd than she     what she had believed to be the tremendous force of her spirit had been  as one grain of sand against the tides of ocean  what was one to think of  it all then  of human love which believed itself created for eternity  of  dreams which one s soul persuaded one would come true  of aspirations  born in a hallucination of power  of that spark within one which played  one false  of believing one could master fate only to find one had  erected a child s house upon the sands  and that what had been achieved  in consciousness of great power could be swept away so easily that the  ocean was not even conscious of having taken it unto itself     very sternly  very understandingly  their lives swept before her  anew     just one little wave from the tide of fate had lapped up   unknowingly  uncaringly  that house upon the sand which a delusion of the  spirit had made seem a castle grounded in eternity  why blind one s self  to the truth and call life fair  for what had they fought and suffered  and believed and hoped  just to hear the mocking voice of the outgoing  tide     the fury of the sea was creeping into her blood  rage possessed her  all  of her spirit  mightier than ever before  went out to meet the spirit of  the sea  hating it  defying it  understanding its own futility  and the  more hot from the sense of impotence  that died to desolation  she had  never been so wholly desolate  the sea so mighty  she so powerless  fate  and human souls were like that     karl  where was he  swept out by the ocean of fate  to what shore had he  been carried  what thought he of the tide which had carried him out from  her  was his soul  like hers  spending itself in the passion of  rebellion  so mighty as to shake the foundations of one s being  so  futile as to prevail against not one drop of water in that sea of fate     time passed  the tide was still coming in  nearing its height  but to the  sea there had come a change  the spirit of it seemed different  for a  long time she sat there dimly conscious of a difference  and then it  seemed as though the sea were trying to reach her with something it had  to bring     she tried to shake herself free from so strange a fancy  but it held her   and for a long time she sat there motionless  looking out at the sea with  all her eyes  reaching out to it with all her soul  becoming more and  more still   a hush upon her whole being   moved  held  unreasoningly  expectant     the sea seemed trying to make her ready  each wave which beat upon the  rocks beat against her consciousness  driving against her mood and  spirit  as if clearing a way  making her ready  open  to what would come     it seemed finally to have cleared her whole being  driven away all which  might impede  it seemed now as though she could take in things not seen  or heard  there was that strange openness of the spirit  that hush  that  unreasoning expectancy     all at once it rushed upon her  filling her overwhelmingly  it said that  there was a sea mightier than what she called the sea of fate  it told of  a sea of human souls over which fate only seemed to prevail  a great rush  of truth filled her with this  it was the belief in the omnipotence of  fate which was the real delusion of the spirit     over and over again  with steadily rising tide  it told her that   no  more to be reasoned away than the sea  resistless as the tide     she never knew in after years just what it was happened in that hour  she  could not have told it  for it was not a thing for words to compass  but  after that great truth had rushed full upon her  sweeping away the  philosophy of her bitterness  karl s spirit  something sent out from him  to her  seemed to come in with the tide  he pleaded with her  he asked  her to stop fighting and come back to the soul of things  he asked her to  be ernestine  his ernestine  he told her that his own spirit could not  find peace while hers was waging war and full of bitterness  he wanted  her to make a place for them both in that great world harmony of their  belief  he told her that out where souls see in wider sweeps  they know  that there is a spirit over which death and fate cannot prevail     darkness came on  but she had no thought of fear  and before she turned  away something had risen from the dead  out of woe and despair  defeat  and bitterness  out of loneliness and a broken heart  something was born  again  karl asked that she make it right with the world  karl asked for a  child of their love  and at the last it was the call of the child to the  mother which she heard  it was the maternal instinct of the spirit which  answered     very late that night  after she had sat long at her window  looking up at  the stars  waiting  a great light seemed to appear  and shimmering  against the sky  high above the tides of the sea  she saw the picture  which she would paint           chapter xlii      work the saviour    for more than three years then they saw nothing of ernestine  she left  this note for georgia   i am sorry to seem erratic  but i cannot wait for  you  i am going away at once  i am going first to new york  and then  i  think  to paris  i am going to do something which i can do better there  than anywhere else  thank you  georgia  for everything  it must be  satisfying to feel one has succeeded as beautifully in anything as you  have succeeded in being a friend to me  do not worry  there is nothing  now to worry about  you will be glad to know that i am going back to my  work      a little later dr  parkman had this from her from new york   i am sailing  for paris  i am going to work  i see it all now  all that you would have  me see  and more  some day i will try to show you just how well i see it      i do not know how i am going to bear part of it  the going back where we  were so happy  but i  will  bear it  for nothing shall keep me from the  work i see before me      thank you  for all that you have done  and most of all for all that you  have been  my idea is all comprehended in this  to the very uttermost of  my power  i am going to make it right for karl      six months later she wrote him this      dear doctor  thank you for attending to those things for me  it  infuriated me at first to think that the only thing in money left by the  work of karl s great life was the money from those books which i resented  so bitterly  but how wrong to see it that way  for karl would be so happy  to know that the brave work he did after his blindness was helping me  now  but i never spend a dollar of this money without thinking of the  mood  the circumstances  out of which it was earned      no  no money for the work he did for the blind  karl intended that as a  gift  he would be so glad to know of its usefulness  he thought it all  wrong that books for the blind were so expensive  and so many of the  great things not to be had      karl used to repeat a little verse of heine  which he translated like  this         at first i did not even hope   and to a hostile fate did bow    but i learned to bear the burden    only do not ask me how         i have learned to bear it here in paris  only do not ask me how  i could  not say  i do not know      but i want to tell you of a few of the good things  you would not  believe what that work in the laboratory has done for me  it has given me  a new understanding of colour  new sense of it  new power with eye and  hand  a better sense of values  would you have thought of that  and do  you not see the reasons for my being glad      what i have done so far is but leading up to what i am going to do  that  is so vital that it must not be done too quickly  i must get my hand in   gain what there is to be gained here  that the work i am going to do for  karl may have the benefit of it all  but i have made innumerable  sketches  and it is growing all the time  there need be no fear of my  losing it  i could no more lose it than i could lose my own soul  it  grows as i grow  sometimes i think i should wait ten years  but i shall  not      yes  the critics like the picture of which you speak  of course i am  painting all the time  other things  various things  but it all seems  like practice work to me  a mere getting ready      and then  after a long time  this    this is my birthday   a day linked  more closely than i could ever tell with karl  our life and work and  love  if i had looked forward from one happy birthday i had and seen what  was ahead  how it would be with me now  i never could have gone on  we go  on by not knowing what is waiting for us  and day by day we bear what we  would have said  looking ahead  we never could endure  and that is human  life      i have been so lonely to day that i must write this little word to one  who will understand  i turn to you as one close to us in those dear days   one who cared for and appreciated karl  understood something of the kind  of love that was ours  doctor  it was so wonderful  so wonderful that it  seems to me sometimes the universe must have existed through the  centuries just that our love might be born  i think of it as the one  perfect flower of creation      i want you to know that i have come to see the worth  pricelessness  of  my memories  karl s love for me lights up my life with a glory nothing  can ever take away  i think we do not have even our memories until we  have earned them  i have tried to come back to my own  to take my place   i am trying to be of that great harmony of the world in which karl and i  believed  and as my spirit turns from discord and seeks harmony  i am  given my memories  the memories of those many perfect days  and i am  never too lonely nor too desolate to thank god that to me was left the  scent of the roses      oh  doctor  where is he now  do you ever think of all that  no one who  has ever loved and lost can remain secure in his materialism  i begin to  see that the beautiful thoughts  the poems  of immortality  eternity  of  its all coming right  have sprung from the lonely hearts of great lovers   for they would not have it any other way  they could only endure it by  having it so  and  ah  doctor  far greater than any proof of science or  logic  is there not proof in this  lifting up their hearts in hours of  desolation were not the men and women born for great loves and great  sorrows granted a vision of the truth      we do not know  none of them know  we hope and wait and long for the  years to tell us the truth  and while we wait and hope  we work  and try  to make our lives that which is worthy our love  that endeavour  and that  alone  makes life bearable      after a year of silence he received this letter   doctor  it is finished   i will not tell you the things they are saying of it here  for you will  read it in the papers  the papers here are full of it  i think i have  never seen so much about any picture      but it is more important that i tell you this  they are seeing it  even  now  as i intended it should be seen  a work of love  a memorial  an  endeavour to make it right for him  i have cared more for what the  scientific people  karl s own kind  have said of it  than the artists   they claim it as their own  say they are going to have it  get it some  way    must  have it  do you not see how that means the fulfillment of my  desire      of course you know that it is a picture of karl  but the critics here  call it less a portrait than the incarnation of an idea  light and truth  sweeping in upon a human soul  one of them expressed it  but why try to  tell you of that  when you see it you will understand what it is i have  tried to do  and you shall see it soon  after it is exhibited here they  want it in vienna  and i cannot refuse  for karl loved vienna  and then a  short time in london  and then i come with it to america  and to chicago   i am bringing it home  doctor  for even though it find final resting  place in that great temple of science in paris  i have the feeling  in  taking it to chicago  that i am bringing it home  and the first day it is  exhibited there i want you and me to go to it together  as karl would  like that we should      i am so tired that i do not believe i shall ever be quite rested again   for the last three months i lived with the picture  my heart and mind  knew nothing else  but the day i finished it my strongest feeling was a  regret that it was finished  a yearning to go on with it forever  for  doctor  i painted my heart  my life  everything that i had within myself   everything i had taken from karl  into that picture  i am lonely now  without it  for it made my life      it has revived karl s whole story  they tell it here  oh so lovingly  i  heard one man from the institute telling it all to a younger man as they  stood before it yesterday  i have moved them to a new sense of karl s  greatness  it has been my glorious privilege to perpetuate him  make sure  his place   reveal  him  for that is what i have sought to do  was not  life good to me to give me power to do that thing      we shall be together in chicago very soon  you and karl and i  for as  the days go on karl comes closer  i hope  most of all  that the picture  will bring him very close to you      that was three months before  and to day he had this note from her  dated  chicago    yes  i am here  and the picture is here  the public exhibit  does not open for a few days  but the picture will be hung this morning   and we may see it this afternoon  i shall be there at three  waiting for  you            chapter xliii       and there was light     he spent the intervening hours restlessly  the hands of his watch moved  slowly  his duties occupied only a small portion of his mind     he was at the institute at just three  and they directed him where to go   his heart was beating fast as he walked down the corridor  the hand which  he laid upon the door knob shook a little     he opened the door  and a woman came toward him with outstretched hand     it was ernestine  but the three years had done much     older  greater  a more steady flame  a more conscious power  grief  transmuted to understanding  despair risen to resolution  she had gone a  long way  he looked at her in silence  reading  understanding  it was all  written there  the story of deep thinking and deeper loving  of battles  and victories  and other battles yet to fight  the poise which attends  the victor  yes  she had gone a long way  and as she spoke his name  and  smiled a little  and then could not repress the tears which his presence   all that it meant  brought  he saw  shining through her tears  that light  of love s own days     she turned and walked to the other side of the room  and he knew that she  was taking him to the picture     she watched his face as he took it in  and she knew then that she had  done her work     for a long time he said nothing  and when at last he turned to her  eyes  dim  voice husky  it was only to say   i can say  nothing  there are  no  words      he turned back to the picture  she standing silent beside him  reading in  his face that with each moment he was coming into more perfect  understanding     for she had painted karl s face as it was just before he went into the  silence  she had caught the look which illumined his face that day on his  death bed when she told him what she had done  she had painted karl as he  was in that moment of perfect understanding  the joy which was uplift   the knowledge which was glory  she had perpetuated in her picture the  things which karl took with him from life  it was karl in the supreme  moment of his life  the moment of revelation  transfiguration  the moment  which lighted all the years     it was triumph which she had perpetuated in the picture  she was saying  to the world  he did not achieve what he set out to achieve  but can you  say he failed when he left the world with a soul like this     he saw that it was what she had done with light which made the picture   from the standpoint of her art  supreme  the critics said that no one had  ever done just that thing with light before  painted light in just that  spirit of loving and understanding it  less light  indeed  than light s  significance  they said that no one before had painted the kind of light  which could make a blind man see  for he was blind  the picture told  that  but it seemed no one had ever had light quite as understandingly as  he had it there      you feel it  doctor   she asked at last  timidly   you see it all      he nodded  it seemed so far beyond any word of his     but she wanted to talk to him about it   you see what it has meant to me   why i loved it and lived for it  oh doctor  i wanted to show that he was  greater than all the great things he sought to do  the night this picture  came to me it set my blood on fire  and at no moment since  no matter how  tired or lonely or discouraged  have i lost my love for it  belief in it   it seems so right  it seems to stand for so many things  they call it a  masterpiece of light  and isn t it fine  great  right  that karl s  portrait should be a masterpiece of light      for a long time he was lost to it  it was as she said  right  to the  blind man had come the light  to the man of science the light of truth   and to the human soul  about to set out on another journey  had come the  perfect understanding of what had lighted the way for him here     when he turned to her at last she was looking at the picture with such  love in her eyes as he had never seen  her lips were parted  tremulous   there were tears upon her cheeks  her whole face quivered with love and  longing  he saw then  in that one glance before he turned away  that time  and death held no sway over such a love as this      i did not mean to   she faltered   but i have not seen the picture  myself for a long time  and your being here       she broke down there  and he summoned no word with which to answer her  sobs      dr  parkman    raising a passionate face   i want you to know that if  this were the greatest picture the world had ever seen  if it were a  thousand times greater than anything the world had ever known  i would  throw it away  obliterate it  gladly  joyously  for just one touch of  karl s hand       yes   he murmured  more to himself than to her   and if you were not  like that you never could have done it       what it cost    he heard her whisper   what it  cost       he told her that it had ever been so  that the great things were paid for  like that  that so many of the things which had lived longest and gone  deepest had come from broken hearts and souls tried almost beyond their  power for suffering  he told her that the future would accept this  as it  had the others  without knowing of its cost  that a myriad of broken  hearts had gone into the sum of the world s achievement     in the half hour which followed  as they sat there  speaking sometimes of  karl  more often silent  some things seemed to pass from the man s heart   other things to come  and as at the last he rose to go  for he felt she  would like a little time alone  he said  and his face and his voice gave  much which the words missed   ernestine  you have done more than you  know  for me too  you have made it right      she sat a long time before her picture  dreaming of karl  she whispered  his name  and he seemed to answer with   liebchen  brave liebchen  you  have been good to me      to her too the hour brought new light  it came to her now that she had  won a victory for them  not because she had painted a great picture  but  because she had brought them back to that world harmony from which they  seemed for a time to have gone  she had won  not through the greatness of  her achievement  but through having made it right with her own soul  the  picture itself was a thing of canvas and paint  it was the spirit out of  which it grew  his spirit and hers  was the thing everlasting  she was  sure that karl too knew now that it was having the spirit right which  counted  the  perhaps  of his letter was surely answered for him now     and out of this closeness to the past there opened to her a little of her  own future  things she would do  for she must work   theirs a love which  made for work  there was much more to paint  much to show how she and  karl loved the world  what they held it worth   and all of it to speak  for their love  glorify  immortalise it     she dreamed deeply and tenderly  the past so real to her  karl  their  love  so great     now she must go  to morrow many others would come  artists would come to  pronounce her work good  wonder how she had done this or that  doctors  and the university men would come  proud to speak of karl  claim him as  their own  but ah  who would understand the tears and heart s blood out  of which it had come  who would know  who could      karl   she murmured at the last  eyes dim with loving tears   dear  karl    dwelling with a long tenderness upon the name   did i indeed  bring you the light                 cast thy rosary on the ground  bind on thy    shoulder the thread of paganism  throw stones at the glass of    piety

    a fine  drizzling rain was striking against the windows of a cosy third  floor sitting room  obscuring what in pleasant weather was a fine  distant view of the charles river  the apartment was evidently that of  a woman  as numerous details of arrangement and articles of feminine  use suggested  and quite as evidently it was the home of a person of  taste and refinement  and of one  too  who had traveled     arthur fenton  a slender young artist  with elegant figure and deep set  eyes  was lounging in an easy chair in an attitude well calculated to  show to advantage his graceful outlines  for occupation he was turning  over a portfolio of sketches  whose authorship was indicated by the  attitude of the lady seated near by     she was a woman of commanding presence  with full lips  whose  expression was contradicted by the almost haughty carriage of her fine  head and the keen glance of her eye  which indicated too much character  for the mere pleasure seeker  her hair was of a rich chestnut  and she  wore a dress of steel gray cashmere  relieved at the throat by a knot  of pale orange  which harmonized admirably with her clear complexion   she watched her companion as if secretly anxious for his good opinion  of her drawings  yet too proud to betray any feeling in the matter  he   for his part  turned them over with seeming listlessness  breaking out  now and then with some abrupt remark      yes   he said suddenly  after a ten minutes  silence   i m going to be  married at once  it will be  a marriage in the bush   as the suabians  call an impecunious match  since neither of us has any money  and i  at  least  haven t so great a superfluity of brains that in this  intelligent age of the world i am ever likely to make much by selling  myself  and that is the only way any body gets any money nowadays       i hardly think you d be willing to sell   his companion answered   no  matter how good the market       there s where you are wrong   he answered  looking up with a sudden  frown   the worst thing about me is that with sufficient inducement  or  even merely from the temptation of an especially good opportunity  i  should sell myself body and soul to the philistines       one would hardly fancy it  from the way you talk of peter calvin and  his followers       oh  as to that   retorted the artist   don t you see that judicious  opposition increases my market value when i am ready to sell  if i  could only be sufficiently prominent in my antagonism  i might  absolutely fix my own price      the lady made no answer  but regarded him more intently than ever      that s a good thing   he broke out again  holding up a drawing   why  don t you do that in marble  or better still  in bronze       i am putting it up in clay   she answered   i thought i had shown it  to you  it is to be fired as my first experiment in a big piece of  terra cotta  that is the first sketch  i think i have improved upon  it      it was the study for a bas relief representing the months  twelve  characteristic figures running forward with the utmost speed  gifts  dropped from their hands as they ran  from the fingers of june fell  flowers  from those of august and september ripened fruits  upon which  november and december trampled ruthlessly  january  in his haste   overturned an altar against which february stumbles      it is melancholy enough   fenton observed  regarding it closely   how  melancholy every thing is now a days       to a man about to be married   she asked  with a fine smile      oh  always to me  the fact that i am going to be married does not  prevent my still being myself       unfortunately not   she returned  with a faint suspicion of sarcasm in  her tone   you pique yourself upon being somber       i dare say   answered he  a trifle petulantly   pain has become a  habit with me  discontent is about the only luxury i can afford  heaven  knows       unless it is gorgeous cravats       oh  that   fenton said  putting his hand to the blue and gold tie at  his throat   i m trying to furbish up my old body and decrepit heart  against my nuptials  so i invested fifty cents in this tie       you couldn t have done it cheaper   remarked she   though  perhaps    she added dryly   it is all the rejuvenation is worth      fenton smiled grimly and again applied himself to the examination of  the drawings  while the other looked out at the rain      boston has more climate  and that far worse   she remarked   than any  other known locality       does that mean that you are going to herman s this afternoon   asked  fenton      i should have gone this morning if you had not insisted upon my  wasting my time simply because you had determined to waste yours      fenton laughed      you are frank to a guest   he said   i wished to be congratulated on  my marriage       i shall not congratulate you   she answered   you are spoiled  the  women have petted you too much       according to the old fairy tale all goes well with the man of whom the  women are fond       i remember   she said   i always pitied their wives       i shall treat edith well       you are too good natured not to  i suppose  especially when you look  forward to your marriage with such rapture       but  helen  have i ever pretended to believe in marriage  marriage is  a crime  think of the wretched folly of those who talk of the holiness  of love s being protected by the sanctities of marriage  if love is  holy  let it have way  if it is not  all the sacraments priests can  devise cannot sanctify it       then why  arthur  do you marry at all       because marriage is a necessary evil as society is at present  constituted       but   helen said slowly   you who pretend to have so little regard for  society        ah  there it is   he interrupted   man is gregarious by instinct  he  must do as his fellows do  he must submit to the most absurd   convenances  of his fellowmen  as one sheep jumps where another  did though the bar be taken away  if he were strong enough to stand  alone he might take conventions by the throat and be a god      his outburst was too vehement and sudden not to come from some  underlying current of deep feeling  rather than from the present  conversation  he had risen while speaking  his head thrown back  his  eyes sparkling  his companion regarded him with admiration  not  unmixed  however  with amusement      and you   she said   choose to call yourself a man without  enthusiasms       yes   replied he  smiling and regaining his seat   i am a man without  enthusiasms       that is the cleverest thing you ever said   helen continued  musingly    and so we understand you intend to be ruled by conventionality and  marry       precisely  it would be unjust to edith to even talk to her of my  views       i should hope so   exclaimed his hostess   but you will at least have  her to yourself  and that pays for every thing       oh   peutetre    fenton returned dubiously  perfectly well aware  that the remark had been made to elicit comment  yet too fond of  talking to resist temptation and leave it unanswered    peutetre    though i never believed in the desert island theory  it is more in your  line  you still have faith in it       oh  i do   she rejoined quickly   and so would you if you were in  love  you d be content to be on a rock in the mid ocean if she were  there       love on a desert island   returned the young man  smiling  significantly   oh   le premier jour  c est bon  le deuxieme jour  ce  n est pas si bon  le troisieme jour  mon dieu  mais comment on  s ennuie        no  no  no   helen broke in impetuously   good  always  always   always  or never      fenton threw back his head and burst into a shout of laughter           twere errant folly to presume       love s flame could burn and not consume      he sang  going off again into peals of laughter   good by   mon  amie   oh   mais comment on s en         stop   interrupted she   i ll have no more blasphemy       good by  then   he said  picking up his hat      you may as well stay to lunch   his hostess said rising      no   returned he   i must go and write to edith      and off he went  humming           twere errant folly to presume      love s flame could burn and not consume            ii     the heavy middle of the night        measure for measure  iv  i     as many of the boston clocks as ever permitted themselves so far to  break through their constitutional reserve as to speak above a whisper   had announced in varying tones that it was midnight  yet the group of  men seated in easy attitudes before the fire in one of the  sitting rooms of the st  filipe club showed no signs of breaking up   indeed  the room was so pleasant and warm  with its artistically  combined colors  its good pictures and glowing grates  and the storm  outside raged so savagely  beating its wind and sleet against the  windows  that a reluctance to issue from the clubhouse door was only  natural  and there would be little room for surprise should the men  conclude to remain where they were until daylight     the conversation  carried on amid clouds of fragrant tobacco smoke and  with potations  not excessive but comfortably frequent  was quiet and  unflagging  possessing  for the most part  that mellow quality which is  seldom attained before the small hours and the third cigar      yes  virtue has to be its own reward   tom bently was saying lightly    for  don t you see  the people who practice it are too narrow minded  to appreciate any thing else       and that makes it the most poorly paid of all the professions   was  the retort of fred rangely  who was lounging in a big easy chair    except literature  that is  even sin is said to get death for its  wage  and that is something       virtue may be an inestimable prize for any thing you newspaper men can  tell  it is not a commodity you are used to handling       literature has little to do with virtue  it is true   was the  response   who would read a novel about virtuous people  for instance   i d as soon study the catechism       how art has to occupy itself with iniquity   fenton observed with a  philosophical puff of his cigar   or what people call iniquity  though  a truer definition would be nature       painting occupies itself with iniquity in its models   rangely said  lazily   i heard to day        no scandals   interrupted grant herman  good humoredly   you are going  to tell the story about flackerman  i know      the speaker was the most noticeable man in the group  tom bently  an  artist  was a tall  swarthy fellow with thin black beard  stubble like  hair  and a gypsyish look  next came fred rangely  an author of some  reputation  of whom his friends expected great things  rather short in  stature  thick set  and with a good tempered  intelligent face   fenton s appearance has already been touched upon  he was of elegant  figure  with a face intellectual  high bred  but marred by a suspicion  of superciliousness  amid these friends  herman gained something by  contrast with each and naturally became the center of the group  this  prominence was partly due to his figure  of large mold  finely formed  and firmly knit  carrying always an air of restful strength and  composure which made itself felt in whatever company he found himself   his head  although not out of proportion with his fine shoulders and  trunk  was somewhat massive  a fact which was emphasized a little by  the profusion of his locks  now plentifully sprinkled with gray  his  face was indicative of much character  the lips firm and full  the eyes  large and dark  now serious under their heavy brows and now twinkling  with contagious merriment      it isn t every model you can talk scandal about   chuckled bently  in  reply to herman s remark   we had a devilishly pretty fuss in nick  featherstone s studio the other day  nick found his match in the new  model       what new model   inquired fenton  arranging himself into an effective  pose before the fire      do you remember the picture of an italian girl that tom demming sent  to the academy exhibition two years ago  a homely face with lots of  character in it  and a splendid pose       you mean the one he called  marietta   it was well done  if i  remember       oh  stunningly  that s the girl  she s just landed  and demming gave  her letters to me  she s a staving good model       but she isn t pretty       no  but she is suggestive  she has one of those faces that you can  make all sorts of things out of  rollins made a sketch of her head that  is stunning  a lovely thing  and it looked like her too  then her  figure is perfect  and what is more  she knows how to pose  she meets  an idea half way  you know  and hits the expression wonderfully  she  has given me points for my picture every time she has been at the  studio       is her name ninitta   grant herman asked      yes  do you know any thing about her       i think i ve seen her in rome  but what is she doing on this side of  the water      to arthur fenton s keen perception there seemed more feeling in the  tone than an inquiry into the affairs of a stranger would be likely to  evoke  but he gave the matter no especial thought      yes   he echoed lightly   what is she here for  there is no art in  this country  new york is the home of barbarism and boston of  philistinism  while cincinnati is a chromo imitation of both  she d  better have staid abroad       your remark is true  arthur   bently laughed   if it isn t very  relevant  what people in this country want isn t art at all  but what  some great panjandrum or other abroad has labeled art  they don t know  what is good       that is so true   was the retort   that i almost wonder they don t buy  your pictures  tom       but why does the girl come to america   persisted herman  with a faint  trace of irritation in his tone   she could do far better at home       oh  demming wrote that she was bound to come  you can never tell what  ails a woman anyhow  probably she has a lover over here somewhere      herman made no reply save by an involuntary lowering of his heavy  brows  and rangely brought the conversation back to its starting point  by asking      but what about nick featherstone       oh  nick  well  nick tried to kiss her yesterday  and she offered to  stab him with some sort of a devilish dagger arrangement she carries  about like an opera heroine       featherstone is always a strong temptation to an honest man s boot    growled herman out of his beard  as he sat with his head sunk upon his  breast  staring into the fire      they had a scene that wouldn t have done discredit to a first class  opera bouffe company   bently went on  laughing at the remembrance      nick was fool enough to hollo to somebody in the next room  and the  result was that we all came trooping in like a chorus  it was absurd  enough      and he laughed afresh      but the girl   persisted grant herman  not removing his gaze from the  fire   how did she take it       oh  she was as calm and cold as you please  she gathered herself  together and went off without any fuss       i wish when you are done with her  you d send her round to me   herman  rejoined   i want a model for a figure  and if i remember her  she ll  do capitally      he rose as he spoke  with the air of a man who intends going home      by the way   fenton said to him   isn t the pagan night next week   don t you have it this month       yes  you ll get your invitations sometime or other  good night all       oh  don t break good company   rangely remonstrated   i have half a  bottle here  and i do hate an alcoholic soliloquy      but the movement for departure was general  and in a few moments more  the members of the company were wending their individual ways homeward  through the pelting rain           iii     the shot of accident          othello  iv   i       the sun shone brightly in at the windows of a little bare studio next  morning  as if to atone for the gloom of the darkness and storm of the  night  the midas touch of its rays fell upon the hair of helen greyson   turning its wavy locks into gold as she softly sang over her modeling     she seemed to find in her work a joy which accorded well with the  bright day  pinned to the wall was an improved sketch of the bas relief  whose design had attracted fenton s notice in her portfolio  while  before the artist stood a copy in clay  upon which she was working with  those mysterious touches which to the uninitiated are mere meaningless  dabs  yet under which the figures were growing into sightliness and  beauty     suddenly her song was interrupted by the sound of footsteps without   followed by a tap upon her door      come   she called  and grant herman entered in response to the  invitation     he carried in his arms a large vase  about whose sides green and golden  dragons coiled themselves in fantastic relief      your vase came from the kiln   he said   and i knew you would want to  see it at once  it is the most successful firing they have done here       oh  i am so glad   she returned  laying down her modeling tools  and  approaching him eagerly   i was sure there wouldn t be a head or a tail  left by the time the poor monsters came out of the fiery furnace  what  a splendid color that back is  and that golden fin is gorgeous       yes  mrs  greyson   herman said   you have produced a veritable  dragon s brood this time  i can almost hear them hiss       do you know   she responded  smoothing the glittering shapes with half  chary touches   i should not be wholly willing to have the vase in my  room at night  they might  you know  come to life and go gliding about  in a ghastly way       i always wondered   the sculptor observed   that eve had the courage  to talk with the serpent  do you suppose she squealed when she saw  him       oh  no  she probably divined that mischief was brewing  and that  contented her      herman had set the vase where all its gorgeous hues were brought out by  the sun  which sparkled and danced upon every spine and scale of the  writhing monsters  he walked away from it to observe the effect at a  greater distance      there is no pleasure like that of creating   he said   man is a god  when he can look on his work and pronounce it good       which is seldom   she returned   unless in the one instant after its  completion when we still see what we intended rather than what we have  made       it is fortunate our work cannot rise up to reproach us for the wide  difference between our intents and our performances  fancy one of my  statues taking me to task because it hasn t the glory it had in my  brain       it is on that account   mrs  greyson said smiling   that i fancy  galatea must have been most uncomfortable to live with  whenever  pygmalion found fault  she had always the retort ready   at least i am  exactly what you chose to make me   poor pygmalion       it was no more true than in the case of every man that marries  we all  bow down to ideals  i suppose  except   he added with a little  hesitation   myself  of course      the words were somewhat awkward in the hesitating accent which gave  them a suggestiveness at which the faintest of flushes mounted to her  cheek  she bent her observations more closely on the vase      it is fired so much better than the last miserable failure   observed  she  going to a shelf and reaching after a dusty vase  massive and  fantastic  which had been ruined in the kiln      let me help you   herman said     but she had already loosened the vase  which proved heavier than she  expected  and it was only by darting forward  and throwing his arms  about her  that the sculptor was enabled to save her from a severe  blow  the vase fell crashing to the floor  breaking into heavy shards   rattling the windows and the casts upon the wall by the concussion     an exclamation escaped him  he had drawn mrs  greyson backward  and for  a brief instant  held her in his strong clasp  it was an accident which  to mere acquaintances might mean nothing  to lovers  every thing   herman was for a moment pale with the fear that helen might be injured   then the hot blood surged into his cheeks as he released his hold and  stepped back  he bent over the fragments of the vase that she might not  see his face  and by so doing  as he reflected afterward  he failed to  perceive what was her expression  he straightened himself with an  impetuous movement  and came a step nearer      how can you be so careless   he demanded  almost with irritation   it  might have killed you       i did not remember that it was so heavy   she returned  a little pale  and panting   do you think i was trying to pull it on my head  i am  very much obliged  though  you have saved me a heavy blow at least   there is not much left of that unlucky vase  it was always  ill starred       all s well that ends well   returned the sculptor  sufficiently  recovering his self control to speak lightly   only don t run such a  risk another time       oh  i assure you   she replied   i do not make my vases either to  break my head or to be broken themselves  i shall take better care of  this one  you may be confident       i was more concerned for yourself than for the vase       for myself it really does not so much matter       it is scarcely kind to your friends to say so       oh   my friends      over her face came an inexplicable expression  which might be gloom or  exultation  and the tone in which she spoke was equally difficult of  interpretation  she seemed determined  however  to fall into no snares  of speech  she smiled upon the sculptor with a glance at once radiant  and perplexing     she turned towards the new vase and began slowly to whirl the  modeling stand upon which herman had placed it  a thousand reflections  danced and flickered about the little room as it revolved in the  sunlight  glowing and glittering like the sparkles from a carcanet of  jewels  the fiery monsters seemed to twine and coil in living motion as  the light shone upon their emerald and golden scales and bristling  spines      i wonder if eve s serpent was so splendid   mrs  greyson laughed   twirling the stand yet faster upon its pivot   would i do for mother  eve  do you think       if the power to tempt a man be the test   he retorted with an odd  brusqueness quite disproportionate to the apparent lightness of the  occasion  the dark blood mantling his face   there can be no doubt of  it      a swift change came over her at his words  she left the vase and stand  abruptly  she flushed crimson then grew pale and looked about her with  a half frightened glance  as if uncertain which way to turn  the  movement touched her companion as no words could have done      i beg your pardon   he muttered     and with a still deeper flush on his swarthy cheek he turned abruptly  and quitted the room           iv     after such a pagan cut         henry viii   i            in the first place   said edith caldwell brightly   you know  arthur   that i ought not to be in boston at all  when i have so much to see to  at home  and in the second place aunt calvin is shocked at the  unconventionality of my being seen any where in public after the  wedding cards are out  but i was determined to see this picture  i saw  it when he had just begun it in paris  you know  three years ago       as for being seen   arthur fenton returned   we certainly shall never  be seen here  the art museum is the most solitary place in the city   and as for conventionalities  why  the wedding is so quiet and so far  off that i think nobody here even realizes that the stupendous event is  imminent at all       oh  but i do   edith said  laughing and clasping her hands with a  pretty gesture of mock despair   i feel that the day of my bondage is  advancing with unfaltering tread  like the day of doom       then you should do as i do by the day of doom  disbelieve in it  altogether until it comes       it is of no use  even disbelief will not alter the almanac  as you ll  find when the day of doom swoops down on you      they were sitting upon one of the hard benches in the picture gallery  of the art museum before an important work just sent over from europe  by its american purchaser  the afternoon light was beginning to be a  little dim  and edith was troubled with the consciousness that the  errands which had brought her for the day to boston were far from being  accomplished  it was pleasant to linger  however  especially as this  might be the last tranquil day she should pass with arthur before their  marriage     she rose from her seat and crossed to the picture of millet  representing a peasant girl with a distaff of flax in her hand  fenton  sat a moment looking after his betrothed  critically though fondly   then with a deliberate movement he left his seat and followed her      think of the distance between this country and that picture   he  remarked  regarding the beautiful canvas   art in america is simply an  irreclaimable mendicant that stands on the street corners and holds out  the catch penny hand of a beggar       oh  no   miss caldwell replied  turning her clear glance to his   that  is only an impostor that pretends to be art  the real goddess has her  temples here       yes   returned he  with a laugh that covered a sneer   but not in the  way you mean      a shadow passed over her face  she turned a wistful glance towards him      i cannot understand  arthur   she said   why you speak so bitterly  about art here  of course  all great men are apt to be misunderstood at  first  but you        i am over estimated   he interrupted  inly vexed at having given the  conversation this turn   it is only for the sake of talking   ma  petite   don t mind it       but  arthur   she persisted   i want to say something  uncle peter  talks as if you sided with the artists here who  who       she was wholly at a loss to phrase what she wished to say  both because  her ideas were rather vague and because she feared lest she might  offend her lover by talking upon a subject which he had markedly  avoided  he made now a fresh effort to divert the talk into a new  channel      never mind the artists   he said   we really must go  besides  you are  only in town for a day and it is no use to attempt the discussion of  questions which involve the entire order of the universe  i promised  mrs  calvin i d bring you back in half an hour  and we ve been here  twice that time already      he ran on brightly and rapidly  leading the way out of the gallery and  down the stairs  and she followed with a suspicion of shadow upon her  face as if the subject of which she had spoken was one of real  importance to her      come in and see the jolly old pasht   arthur suggested  as they  descended the wide staircase     she acquiesced by turning with him into the room devoted to the way  collection of egyptian antiquities  in the center of which stands a  somewhat mutilated granite statue of the goddess pasht  the cat headed  deity  referred to the time of amenophis iii  about      b c  calm   impassive and saturnine the goddess sits  holding the sign of life with  lifeless fingers in as unconscious mockery now as when the symbol was  placed within the stony grasp by some unrecorded sculptor dead more  than thirty centuries ago  all that it has looked upon  all the  shifting scenes and varied lands upon which have gazed those sightless  eyes  have left no record on that emotionless face  whose lips still  keep unchanged their faint smile beneath which lurks a sneer     arthur and edith stood before it  as a pair of egyptian lovers may have  stood long ago  and for a time regarded it in silence  each moved in a  way  though very differently  as their temperaments differed      it is the patron saint of our pagans   the artist said at length   how  much the old creature knows  if she only chose to tell  she could give  us more genuine wisdom than we shall hear in our whole lives  if she  would but condescend to speak       wisdom always knows the value of silence   edith returned smiling      but pasht belies her sex by not being a communicative party   was her  companion s reply   although communicativeness was never a  characteristic of the gods       no irreverence  sir   edith said with an air of mock authority   even  for these dethroned deities  what were the attributes of your  cat headed goddess       oh  various things  pasht means  i believe  the devouring one  and she  has another name signifying  she who kindles a fire   she was the  goddess of war and of libraries  and the  mistress of thought   a sort  of egyptian minerva  i suppose       violence and wisdom always seemed to me a strange combination   edith  said thoughtfully  regarding the stone image intently  as if to drag  from its cold lips a solution of the difficulty      you overlook the destructive power of words  besides  the sword or the  tongue  what does it matter  life is always a conflict  and it is of  minor importance what the weapons are  it is appropriate enough for  this dilapidated  but eminently respectable female to be the  figure head of a society like the pagans where we fight with words but  may come to blows any time      he spoke gayly  pleased with having put entirely out of the  conversation the unpleasant subject of his relations to her uncle  mr   peter calvin  upon which edith had touched  but he who talks with a  woman must expect the unexpected  and as they turned away from the  statue of pasht  and walked towards the street where the carriage was  waiting  miss caldwell abruptly brought the matter up again by asking      but why are you artists opposed to uncle peter  arthur  what is the        the pagans   ma belle   he interrupted coolly  quite as if he  were answering her question  although in reality nothing was further  from his intention   isn t really a society at all  it is only the name  by which we ve taken to calling a knot of fellows who meet once a month  in each other s studios  we are all st  filipe men  but we ve no  organization as a club    well   edith asked  as he paused  evidently  puzzled to discover any connection between her question and his reply      and you   her betrothed responded  tucking her into the carriage and  surreptitiously kissing her hand   are the loveliest of your sex  i ll  come to take you to the depot at six  you know  good by      he closed the carriage door  watched her drive off  and then went his  own way           v     the bitter past     all s well that ends well  v            the pagans  friday  jan       pipes  pictures and punch                 grant herman        such was the invitation received one day by each of the pagans  under a  seal bearing the impress of the goddess pasht     there is little that need be added to fenton s account of the pagans   the society had no organization beyond a rule to meet each month and to  limit its membership to seven  no especial principles beyond an  unformulated although by no means unexpressed antagonism against  philistinism  fenton had suggested pasht as a sort of  dea mater    and had furnished the seal bearing the image of that goddess which it  was customary to use upon the notifications of meetings  and for the  rest there was nothing definite to distinguish this group of earnest  and sometimes fiery young men from any other  they doubtless said a  great many foolish things  but they did so many wise ones that it  seemed but reasonable to assume that there must be some grains of  wisdom mingled with whatever dross was to be found in their speech     their views were extreme enough  fenton was fond of maintaining  astounding propositions  using the club much as dr  oliver wendell  holmes once privately said wendell phillips does the community   to try  the strength of extravagant theories   and none of the pagans were  restrained by any conventionality from a free expression of opinion     it was on the afternoon of the day fixed for the pagan meeting when  helen greyson took her way across the common and through the business  portion of the city to the building down by the wharves where were the  studios of herman and his pupils  it was feebly raining  the weather  having been decidedly whimsical all that week  and the clouds rolled in  ragged  sullen masses overhead  helen felt the gloom of the day as a  vague depression which she endeavored in vain to shake off  and  hastened towards her studio  hoping to be able to lose herself in her  work     picking her steps among the piles of fire brick and terra cotta which  lumbered the yard and the long shed skirting the building  which was a  terra cotta manufactory  she let herself in at a side door and went  directly to her studio     removing the wet cloths from her bas relief  she stood for a moment  studying it  and then investing herself in a great apron  set busily to  work upon one of the fleeting figures in the composition     she had scarcely begun when as often before a heavy step was heard upon  the stair without  a tap sounded lightly upon her door  and  in answer  to her invitation  grant herman entered     he  too  had evidently been working in clay  of which his loose blouse  bore abundant marks  a paper cap  not unlike that of a pastry cook in  an english picture  was stuck a little aslant over his iron gray locks   giving him a certain roguish air  with which the occasional twinkle in  his eye harmonized well      good morning  mrs  greyson   he said in his hearty voice  and then  stood for a moment looking over her shoulder at her work in silence      do you think the movement of that figure too violent   his pupil  asked  turning to look up at him  and noticing for the first time that  despite the saucy pose of his cap  the sculptor was evidently not in  the best of spirits      no   returned he  rather absently   but you must have less agitation  in the robe  it is merely hurried now  not swift  lengthen and simplify  those folds  so      as he indicated the desired curves with his nervous fingers  mrs   greyson s quick eye caught sight of a striking ring upon his hand  and  without thought she said  involuntarily      you have a new ring       yes   returned herman  flushing   or rather a very old one  it is an  intaglio that the artist hoffmeir  i have told you of our friendship in  rome  gave me one christmas  i returned it to him when i left rome  and  at his death he in turn sent it back to me       but hoffmeir has been dead several years       more than six  but the ring has just come into my hands      the intaglio was a dark sard beautifully cut with the head of minerva   and mrs  greyson s artistic instincts were keenly alive to the  exquisite delicacy of its workmanship  she inquired something of its  origin and probable age  and then dropped it from her attention  save  that  being a woman  she wondered a little what was the personal  bearing of this token  and whether the sculptor s sadness arose from  the awakening of memories connected with it      it must seem like a token from the grave   she said   coming as it  does  so long after hoffmeir s death       it does   the other replied  soberly   but it brought a message with  it  oh  the wretchedness of hearing a voice from the dead  to whom you  can send no answer      the burst of emotion with which he said this was very unusual  and mrs   greyson regarded him with perhaps as much surprise as sympathy  having  never before seen him so deeply moved      i am afraid   she ventured  hesitatingly   that what i said seemed  intrusive  though of course it was not meant to be       it did not seem so  but i am out of sorts this afternoon  i have sent  my model away because i am too much unstrung to work       i hope nothing bad has happened   said helen  quickly      no  nothing  it s only this message from dear old hoffmeir      he walked away and pulled aside the curtain which screened the lower  half of the window overlooking the water  and stood gazing out at a  vessel lying beside the wharf beneath  mrs  greyson laid down her  modeling tools  disturbed by the other s disquiet  and wondering how  best to distract his attention from himself  her glance roved  inquiringly about the little room  noting every cast upon the dingy  walls  bits of sculptured foliage  architectural forms  and portions of  the human figure  then her gaze rested an instant upon her own work   and from that turned toward the robust form by the window      come  mr  herman   she said at length  in a tone half jesting   i  never saw you so somber       it is not that hoffmeir is dead  poor fellow   herman replied   answering her unspoken question   i d made up my mind to endure that   and any man with his over sensitive temperament is better off on the  other side of the grass than this any day  i may as well tell you  mrs   greyson  though as a rule i do not find much comfort in blurting out  things  the fact is that hoffmeir and i quarreled over a girl  we were  both in love with her  like two young fools as we were  but she d  promised to marry me  and  it was a deal better that she didn t  too  i  thought he tried to take her from me  now i know i was wrong  and that  fritz was as high souled as a god in the matter  but then i sent him  back his ring  and broke off with him and her too  i was a fiery young  fool in those days   he added  with a sad and bitter smile   a young  fool       and was it never explained       never until to day  he was far too proud a man to call me back       but the girl   queried helen  with increasing eagerness   what did she  do       oh  the girl   he repeated  turning away again and directing his gaze  out of the window   what would you expect her to do  she was only a  peasant  and though i was honest enough then  i outgrew that fever  centuries ago       yes  you did   returned helen  with gentle persistence   but what did  she do       what do women usually do when they break with one lover  get another   i suppose      the words were so hard and coarse to come from a man like grant herman  that she involuntarily looked up quickly at him  and perhaps he noticed  the action     it was evident that some deep pain had provoked the expression  yet had  found no relief in the rough words  the sculptor turned toward his  companion as if to speak  then slowly his eyes fell  and he said  firmly  if a little stiffly      i believe i do her injustice  if she ever loved a man she was one who  would love him always      he left the little room without more words  his firm  even tread  sounding down the uncarpeted stairs until the door of his own studio  was heard to close after him  mrs  greyson stood before her clay  wondering  and then  sinking into a chair  sat so long absorbed in  thought that the short daylight faded about her and she was forced to  give up further work that day  replacing the wet cloth with which her  bas relief had been covered  she prepared to return home  as she passed  the door of herman s studio the sculptor opened it      i do not know   he said  extending his hand   what made me so rude  this afternoon  i am a bear of a fellow  but i had meant to treat you  well      he had fully recovered his composure  but his evident desire to efface  the impression he had made naturally rendered it more lasting in  helen s mind           vi     a bond of air     troilus and cressida  i           had helen been present at the scene which took place in herman s studio  earlier in the afternoon  she would perhaps have wondered less at his  disturbance     in response to the sculptor s request made at the club when ninitta s  name was first mentioned  bently  when the girl finished posing for  him  sent her to the sculptor s studio     she came a day or two later than bently had directed her  not  hastening  although for six years she had shaped her entire life to the  end of meeting grant herman  she came into the studio as calmly and as  quietly as if it were some familiar place which she had left but  yesterday  and she greeted the sculptor with as even and musical tone  as in the old roman days when as yet nothing had occurred to stir her  peaceful bosom     for his part the man stood and looked at her in silence  even when a  ghost from the past has appeared at his especial summons  one seldom  sees it unmoved  and herman was conscious that his heart beat more  quickly  that he breathed more heavily as ninitta let fall behind her  the rug  portiere  and came towards him through the studio     she had a dark  homely face  only redeemed from positive ugliness by  her deep  expressive eyes  her figure was superb  rather slender  lithe  and sinewy  but without an angle or thin curve  like diana  she was  long limbed  so that she seemed taller than she really was  the sweep  of neck and shoulder was exquisite  and her simple dress was admirably  adapted to display the lines of her supple form  as she walked down the  studio  setting her feet firmly and carrying her head with fine poise   grant herman felt the ghost of an old passion stir in his heart      how do you do   he composedly answered her greeting   you have  improved since i saw you last       thank you   she said  in a rich voice with strong but pleasant accent    i have had time       but improvement is not always a question of time   returned he   look  at me       you have grown old   ninitta commented  regarding him keenly   you are  gray now       yes   retorted the other lightly   i am an old man  it is really a  very long time since you posed for me in my little den at rome       you remember those days perhaps  sometimes   she said  dropping the  long lashes over her eyes     a shadow passed over herman s high brow      is one likely to forget such days   he demanded   is one likely to  forget how love may be turned to treachery and        pardon   the woman interrupted with dignity   i did not come to be  reproached   eccelenza   you have not forgotten signor hoffmeir       no   he answered  with a deepening frown   i have not forgotten the  man who pretended to be my friend and proved it by stealing my  betrothed       it is well that you have not forgotten   ninitta went on calmly  but  earnestly   for i have a message from him  he charged me when he was  dying   she added  crossing herself   to give it to you with my own  hands  i have been waiting for all these years  but now i am free of my  promise      herman took the packet she extended toward him  and turned abruptly  away  ninitta seated herself in one of the tall easy chairs  removed  her hat  and began a leisurely survey of the place  the sounds from the  wharf outside  the cries of the sailors  the creaking of the cordage  and the ships came softened and mellowed like the daylight into the  wide  dim studio  giving a certain sense of remoteness by the contrast  they suggested between the silence within and the stir of the world  without  for all her outward calm  ninitta s heart was beating hotly   and she longed with a great yearning for a touch from the hand of the  silent man before her  for a word of kindness from his lips  she  watched him furtively  under cover of looking at a cast of celini s  perseus upon a bracket above his head  as he stood reading the letter  from hoffmeir      why did you not bring this to me before   the sculptor asked at  length  turning towards her   it is six years now       have i been able to shape my life   returned ninitta   i have followed  you to florence  to paris  you came to america  i followed you to new  york  you were here  i have never ceased trying to reach you  it was  not easy for me to cross half the world alone and without help  with no  friends  no money  with nothing       but you have been in boston a couple of months       yes   she said quietly  looking up into his face   but you knew it  i  waited for you to send for me       i have only known it a week   was the sculptor s reply   do you know  what was in hoffmeir s letter       his ring  the one you wore in rome       but do you know what he wrote       no   she answered   how should i      her questioner looked at her a moment in silence  she put up her head  proudly with an involuntary response to the questioning which his  silence implied  and met his eyes unflinchingly  yet he put his thought  into words      it is seven years since i saw you   he said at length      it is seven years   she echoed      in seven years a great deal may happen   continued he  still regarding  her closely      much  much has happened   she returned  still meeting his gaze without  shrinking      are you married   he asked  with a certain abruptness which to a  careful observer might have indicated that the question cost him an  effort      no   ninitta returned simply   how could i be when i was betrothed to  you       but that was broken off       the sentence stuck in his throat  and he wondered that he could have  begun it  he wondered  too  how he could even have doubted the faith of  the woman before him  and most of all he wondered if he had ever really  loved her  he had an irritating consciousness that something was  expected of him which he was unwilling to give  some sign of  tenderness  some caress such as befitted the reconciliation of lovers  long separated by misunderstanding and blinding jealousy  he felt as if  he were falling below the demands of the occasion  most annoying of  sensations to the masculine mind  but an important interview can with  difficulty be changed from the key in which it is begun  and even had  his feelings prompted a display of tenderness  he felt that it would  seem abrupt and forced  he waited for ninitta to speak      yes   she said  after a moment  as he did not continue   it was broken  off  but signor hoffmeir said that was because you did not understand   and that everything would be as it had been when you got his letter      a sad hopelessness began to appear in her eyes  she had of old been too  accustomed to submit to her lover s will to assume the initiative now   despite the development and strength which time had given to her  character  the sculptor did not dream how her heart throbbed beneath  her quiet demeanor  but he was too sensitive not to be touched by the  unconscious appeal of her voice and look     seven years before  an enthusiastic student in rome  he had loved or  believed he loved  the peasant girl ninitta  whom he had found in an  excursion to capri and induced to come to the eternal city as a model     too honorable to betray her  he had meant to make the model his wife   and was betrothed to her with a solemnity of which he was keenly  reminded to day by the ring which she still wore upon her finger   circumstances had convinced him  however  that ninitta was deceiving  him  and that she preferred the artist hoffmeir  his best friend  to  break off both engagement and friendship without listening to a word  of explanation  to leave rome and italy  were comparatively easy for a  passionate man stung to the quick by a double treachery  to forget was  more difficult  and although a thousand times had herman assured  himself that he had extinguished the last spark of emotion concerning  this episode  the faintest breath of an old memory was still sufficient  to rekindle some seemingly dead ember  to day  holding in his hand the  letter from his lost friend which removed all his doubts  he saw that  instead of being injured he had himself been cruel and unjust  he felt  the full anguish of having committed an irreparable fault  we may  outlive our past  its sorrows we may forget  its wrongs we may forgive   we may even smile at its crushed hopes  ambitions and loves with  scarcely a tinge of bitterness  but that which we have been stings us  ever with the burning pain of an undying remorse  it is not what we  have done which awakens our deepest self scorn  it is the fact that we  were this which made it possible for us to do it  to feel that he had  been capable of the cruelty of abandoning his betrothed and of wounding  his closest friend  merely from a groundless suspicion  was to grant  herman a pain never to be wholly outlived     nor was he without a teasing pain  through a less noble trait in his  nature  from the consciousness that he had loved ninitta  once the  fires of love have burned out  any mortal is apt to be lost in amazed  wonderment how they were ever kindled  and that it was hard for grant  herman  at thirty five  to understand how grant herman  at  twenty seven  could have adored an italian peasant model is not so  without precedent as to be wholly incomprehensible     ninitta had been a good girl  his thoughts ran  was doubtless so still   her figure was enchanting  he would have been no sculptor had he failed  to appreciate that  he had been a boy  a foolish youngster to be  dizzied by a rushing of the blood to his head  but to make her his wife  now         ninitta   he said  suddenly  breaking off from his thoughts into  words   i am not well to day  come to morrow  are you comfortably  settled in town  do you need money       no   she answered  rising   i do not want money      she went slowly down the studio without further word  only turning back  as she passed bently s picture for which she had posed  and which had  been brought for the meeting of the pagans      you have seen   she said   i am able to earn  i have learned much  while i was bringing you that letter  across the world is a long way   no  i have no need of money            vii     in way of taste     troilus and cressida  iii           grant herman s studio  in which the pagans met that night  was in  its way no less unique than the company there gathered  it was a  great  misshapen place  narrow  half a hundred feet long  and  disproportionately high  with undressed brick walls and cement floor   the upper half of one of the end walls was taken up with large windows   before which were drawn dingy curtains  here and there about the place  were scattered modeling stands  water tanks mounted upon rude tripods   casts  and the usual lumber of a sculptor s studio  while upon the  walls were stuck pictures  sketches  and reproductions in all sorts of  capricious groupings     in one corner a flight of stairs led to a gallery high up against the  wall  over the rude railing of which looked the heads of a couple of  legless statues  from this gallery the stairs continued to ascend until  a door near the roof was reached  leading to unknown regions well up in  the building behind which the studio had been built as an afterthought   on shelves were confusedly disposed dusty bits of bronze  plaster   coarse pottery and rare glass  things valueless and things beyond price  standing in careless fellowship  a canvas of corot looked down upon a  grotesque  grimacing japanese idol  a beautiful bronze reproduction of  a vase by michael angelo stood shoulder to shoulder with a bean pot  full of tobacco  a crumpled cravat was thrown carelessly over the arm  of a dancing faun  while a cluster of barye s matchless animals were  apparently making their way with great difficulty through a collection  of pipes  broken modeling tools  faded flowers and loose papers  every  where it was evident that the studio of herman differed from heaven in  at least its first law     quite in keeping with the picturesque  richly stored room  was the  group of men walking about the place or seated near the rough table  upon which refreshments were placed  on this table were a couple of  splendid punch bowls of antique cut glass  which  if not full now  had  unmistakable marks of having been so earlier in the evening  a coarse  dish of yellow earthen ware beside them held an ample supply of  biscuits  and was in turn flanked by a couple of plates of cheese   fruit  beer  and tobacco in various forms  with abundant glasses and  pipes  completed the furnishing of the board  upon which a newspaper  supplied the place of a cloth     tom bently s long  shapely limbs were disposed in a big easy chair by  the table  his tongue being just now employed in one of his not  infrequent harangues upon art  his remarks being plentifully spiced  with profanity      whatever crazy ideas on art   bently was saying   aren t good for any  thing else have to be put into a book  the surest recommendation in art  circles is getting out a book or giving a rubbishy lecture  every woman  who has painted a few bunches of flowers or daubed a little pottery   writes a book to tell how she did it  as if it were the most  astonishing thing in the world       women are very like hens   interpolated fenton   they always cackle  most over the smallest egg       if any one of the crew   continued bently   could appreciate a  fiftieth part of the suggestions in a single sketch of an old master   she might have something to write about       but then she would know enough to keep still   said rangely      oh  a woman never knows enough to keep still   bently retorted   it is  damned amusing to hear the average american         a chorus of protestations arose      we ll have nothing about the  average american   bently       start somebody else on his hobby   suggested ainsworth   that s the  only way to choke bently off  where s fenton  i never knew him quiet  for so long in my life      arthur had been watching his companions and smoking in silence  he  smiled brilliantly at ainsworth s challenge      i m overwhelmed by bently s oaths   he said   he outdoes himself  to night       when it comes time for tom s epitaph   observed rangely   i shall  suggest that it be a dash       why do you swear so   inquired ainsworth   don t you think it in  execrable taste       taste   laughed bently   yes  it s so far above all taste as to be  a  sight higher and bigger       i make a distinction   herman put in good naturedly   between swearing  and blasphemy  and tom never blasphemes  his cursing is all in the  interest of the highest virtues       profanity is like smoking   added tom   every thing depends upon how  you do it  the english  for instance  smoke for the brutality of the  thing  they never have any of the french  finesse   and their  smoking is nothing less than a crime  but as the arabs smoke it is one  of the loftiest virtues  there s something godlike about it      it is from smoking   fenton chimed in   that the orientals learned how  to treat women  for a woman is like tobacco  the aroma should be  enjoyed and the ashes thrown away       by george   exclaimed one of the pagans  moved by some rare  compunction to remember that he had a wife at home   that s infamous   arthur       it is my belief   observed ainsworth deliberately   that fenton lies  awake nights to invent beastly things to say about women  and when he  gets something that he thinks is smart he throws it into the  conversation any where  without the slightest regard to whether it fits  or not       what makes you so bitter against women   asked bently      yes   added rangely  with mock deprecation   why do you want to  annihilate the sex  what harm have women ever done to you       oh   retorted the artist   it is on theoretical principles  purely  i  adore that masculine ideal which man calls woman  but only finds in his  brain  the highest on earth is reached only by the absolute elimination  of the feminine  ah  man is at his best in war   he went on  his  attitude becoming less studied and more forcible  as he allowed his  intellectual interest to overpower his vanity   there he is all  masculine  man without the limitations that the presence of woman  imposes upon him  there woman is ignored  and even if she has been the  cause of the war  and to be the cause of war is woman s noblest  prerogative   she is for the time being as completely forgotten as if  she had never existed  she slips into oblivion as does the horn of grog  which gives his courage      fenton was in a mood when he fancied he was talking well  a conviction  which was not always an accurate measure of the real worth of his  remarks  he delighted in presenting half truths in forcible  phraseology  relishing the taste of an epigram quite without reference  to its verity  he amused himself and his friends with talk more or less  brilliant  of which no one knew better than himself the fallacy  but  whose cleverness atoned with him for all defects  the intellectual  excitement of giving free rein to his fancy and his tongue was  dangerously pleasant to arthur  who often more than half convinced  himself of the verity of his extravagant theories  and oftener still  involved himself in their defense by yielding to the mere whim of  phrasing them effectively      you are on your high horse to night  fenton   cried rangely   you make  no more of a metaphor than a racer of a hurdle       don t stop him   ainsworth said   let him run the course out now he s  on the track       when man comes into his kingdom   fenton broke out again  too fully  aroused to mind the banter  yet with a sort of double consciousness  enjoying the absurdity of the whole conversation   when man comes into  his kingdom  when we get to the perfection of the race  there will be  no women  the ultimate man will be masculine  men  only men  gloriously  and eternally masculine    but how will the race perpetuate itself    asked tom in as matter of fact a tone as he might have inquired the  time of day      perpetuate itself   blazed the other   the race will not need to  perpetuate itself  the world will be peopled with gods  when once women  are gone the race will have become immortal      a shout of mingled applause and derision greeted this outburst  amid  which fenton threw himself back in a lounging chair and lighted a fresh  cigar  he was intoxicated with himself  and few draughts are more  dangerous      take to the lecture platform  fenton   jeered ainsworth   you ll make  your mark in the world yet       i wonder you stopped at immortality   remarked fred rangely   you  usually go on to dispose of the future state       impossible   retorted the artist   for you never heard me say i  believed in one       that s a fact   confessed the other   but you insist so emphatically  that women have no moral sense that your philosophy certainly would  dispose of them if it allow any future state       for my part   declared herman   i ve heard fenton talk nonsense as  long as i want to  let s look at the pictures      an informal exhibition had been arranged  consisting of pictures loaned  by friends  and including several by members of the club  the most  important of the latter was a gypsy which bently had just completed   and which exhibited that artist s defects and excellences in the  emphatic manner usual with his productions  the  motif  was better  than the  technique   but bently s splendid feeling for color  somehow carried him through  and made the picture not only striking but  rich and suggestive      if you could learn to draw  tom   fenton said  as they stood looking  at it   you d be the biggest man in america       is that the new model you were talking about   asked rangely      yes   bently answered   isn t she a stunner       i thought that shoulder was something new   put in fenton   the girl  poses well  trust a woman with shoulders like that to know how to  display them       good heavens   exclaimed grant herman in sudden and rare irritation    can you never have done slurring at women  didn t you have a mother   in heaven s name let some woman escape your tongue for her sake      such an outburst from their host produced a profound sensation upon the  pagans  the most tolerant of men  he was accustomed to listen to their  wholesale denunciations of all things with a good natured smile   contenting himself with a calm contradiction now and then  proverbial  for his patience and good temper  he produced the greater sensation now  when he gave vent to his anger upon a subject which not only fenton but  every guest present usually considered fair game      i m sorry i vexed you  herman   fenton said  turning to him after a  moment s silence   but however much i ve abused women  you never heard  me blackguard a woman in your life       you are right   the sculptor replied  catching the other s slender  hand in his stalwart grasp   i beg your pardon  i m out of sorts  i  suppose  or i shouldn t be quarreling like a christian  let s brew a  new bowl and drink to pagan harmony            viii     the inly touch of love     two gentlemen of verona  ii           after the pagans had separated that night fred rangely lingered in  herman s studio     the sculptor somehow found it possible to be more frank with rangely  than with any other of his companions  and although there was a  difference of some half a dozen in the count of their years  and  perhaps more in their ages as measured by experiences  herman s strong  but naturally stormy nature found much pleasure in the calm philosophy  of his friend     scarcely were the two men alone  when rangely turned to his host and  demanded abruptly      now  i want to know  grant  what in the devil is the matter with you  to night  what set you out to pitch into fenton so      herman poured out a glass of wine and swallowed it before replying      because i am a damned idiot   he retorted savagely   i m all shaken  up  fred  and the worst of it is that i don t see any way out of the  snare i m in       it isn t real trouble  i hope       isn t it  by jove   cried the sculptor   the more honest a man is in  this world the worse off he is  if i hadn t had a conscience when i was  a young fellow  i should be all right now  who is it  fenton   that is  always saying that he asks forgiveness for his virtues and thanks the  gods for every vice he can cultivate       well   rangely remarked  filling a pipe  and curiously surveying his  companion  who was raging up and down the studio   you don t seem to be  in an especially cheerful and enlivening frame of mind  that s a fact   if a fellow can be of any help  call on  if not  at least try to take  it a little more gently for the sake of your friends       do any thing   retorted the other   no  there s nothing to be done   i m a fool       even that disease has been remedied before now   rangely said coolly    though usually experience and time are necessary to the cure       i ll tell you the whole story   herman exclaimed  flinging himself  into a chair   it is all simple enough  it is always simple enough to  tangle things up so that lucifer himself cannot unsnarl them  when i  was in rome i was in love  crazily  gushingly in love  you understand   like a big schoolboy  with a girl i found in capri  she was a good  little thing  with a figure like helen s  that s what did the business  for me  i coaxed her to rome to be my model  and then that infernal  conscience of mine made me ask her to marry me  i could have done any  thing i liked with her  i knew that  she had nobody to look after her  but a half sister who paid about as much attention to her as if she had  been a grasshopper  but the infernal new england puritanism in my blood  wouldn t let me hurt her       and somebody else wasn t so scrupulous   asked the listener as his  friend paused in his story      you think so   returned herman eagerly   then i wasn t so unutterably  a scoundrel for thinking so  too  was i  i did doubt her  i had reason  to  she posed for a friend of mine  a painter  you know  of course  hang  it  what s the use of going into all the details  i was poor as a  church mouse or she shouldn t have done it at all  even for him  the  gist of the story is that i was jealous and flew out at both of them   and left rome in a rage      the two men sat in silence for some moments  rangely puffed vigorously  at his pipe  while his companion stared savagely into the shadows in  the further end of the studio  neither looked at the other  the hearer  appreciated too well the shame facedness by which these unusual  confidences must be accompanied  from some distant steeple a clock was  faintly heard striking two      and to day   herman at length began again in an altered voice   to day  she came here  she has followed me all these years  going through  heaven knows what experiences and hardships  to bring me the proof that  i was a madman blinded by groundless jealousy  and that instead of  being wronged i cursedly abused both her and poor dead old hoffmeir      again there came an interval of silence  a lamp flickered and went out  with a muffled sound  the thoughts of both men were of that formless  character scarcely to be distinguished from emotions  on the one hand  sad and remorseful  on the other sympathetic and pitiful      well   rangely ventured after a time      but what shall i do   demanded herman   i cannot marry her       no  of course not  she cannot expect it after banging about the  world       oh  it isn t that   the other said hastily   she is as good and as  pure as when i left her  at least i believe so  and she does expect  it       she does expect it   echoed his friend   ah      the reception of a confidence is a most delicate ordeal through which  few people come unscathed  rare individuals are born with the ready  sympathies  quick apprehension  and exquisite tact needful  but the  vast majority are sure to wound their friends if the latter ever  venture to approach with their armor of reticence laid wholly aside     although perhaps not the ideal confidant  rangely was sympathetic and  possessed of at least sufficient discretion to avoid comment until he  knew the whole situation and was sure that his opinion was desired  he  was still unable fully to understand his friend s agitation  the task  of disposing of an old sweetheart in so inferior a position not  appearing to his easy going nature a matter sufficiently difficult to  warrant so deep disquiet     precisely the clew that he needed the sculptor had not given  but he  was endeavoring to overcome his repugnance to disclosing his most  secret feelings  every word cost him an effort  but he went on with a  savage sense of doing penance by the self inflicted torture      yes   he repeated   she expects it  why shouldn t she  poor thing  she  has not changed  and she does not understand that i may have altered       and you have      grant herman looked up and down the great studio  now growing dusky  from the burning out of candles here and there  an antique lamp which  was lighted only on special occasions stood where the breeze came to it  from the high window  and the flame  wind swept  smoked and flared   through the silence the listener s ear could detect a faint sound of  the tide washing against the piles of the wharf outside     the sculptor started up suddenly and stood firmly  throwing back his  splendid head and shoulders  and looking straight into the eyes of his  friend      yes   he said in a clear  low voice   i have changed  i   there is  some one else       life   remarked rangely  with seeming irrelevancy   life is a  fallacy       i d like to be honorable   herman continued   but how can i  it is  impossible to be honest to both her and myself  if i hadn t had any  scruples  then   bah  what a beast i am  poor ninitta      still rangely smoked in silence  and the sculptor went on again      it has always been my creed that when a man has allowed a woman to  love him  much more  made her love him  as i did  he is a black hearted  knave to let a change in himself wreck her happiness  now i am put to  the test       and the other one   asked rangely   does she know that you care for  her       i have never said so to her  heaven only knows how much she feels by  intuition  a man always fancies that the woman he loves can tell       that may depend something on how often you see her    i see her  nearly every day  she is my pupil       mrs  greyson       yes   herman said  a little defiantly  as if now the secret was told  he challenged the right of another man to share it      is she a widow       yes   the other answered  with no perceptible pause  and yet between  the question and his reply had come to him the swift remembrance that  he really knew nothing of his pupil s life or history  and had simply  taken it for granted that her husband was not living   arthur fenton  brought her here   he added  rather thinking aloud than answering any  point of rangely s query   he was an old friend of her husband       but what will you do with the other      instead of replying herman got up from the seat into which he had flung  himself  and went about the studio putting out the lights      go home   he said with a whimsical smile   i m sure i don t know what  we are talking about at this time of the morning  as for what i shall  do  well  time will show  i am as ignorant as yourself on the subject            ix     voluble and sharp discourse     comedy of errors  ii   i       it suited fenton s whim next morning to dine with mrs  greyson  he had  established the habit of dropping in when he chose  always sure of a  welcome  and always sure  too  of a listener to the tirades in which he  was fond of indulging  if helen did not always accord him agreement   she at least gave attention  and he cared rather to talk than to  convince     his aesthetic taste  moreover  was gratified by the pretty breakfast  table  and he was not without a subtle sense of pleasure in the beauty  and harmonious dress of his hostess  who possessed the rare charm of  contriving to be always well attired  this morning she wore a gown of  russet cashmere with here and there knots of dull gold ribbon  which  tint formed a pleasing link between the stuff and the color of her  clear skin      it is good of you to come   she said  as she poured his coffee   there  are so few days left before you will have married a wife and cannot  come  i shall miss you very much       why do you persist in talking in that way      fenton returned   i m not going out of the country or out of the world   you could not take a more absolute farewell if i were about to be  cremated       you do not know   replied she  smiling   however  i am glad you are to  be married  it will do you good  you need a wife  if you do dread  matrimony so much       it is abominable   he observed deliberately   to talk as i do  of  course i do not mind what you choose to think of me  or rather i am  sure you will not misunderstand       i do not   mrs  greyson interpolated significantly       but it seems a reflection upon miss caldwell   he continued   answering her interruption only by a grimace   for me to discourse of  marriage just as i do  it isn t because i m not fond of her  it is my  protest against the absurd and false way in which society regards  marriage  in a word against marriage itself      mrs  greyson understood arthur fenton as well as any woman can  understand a man who is her friend  her friendship softened the  harshness of her judgments  but she could not be blind to his vanity   his constant efforts at self deception  and so far as she was in  possession of the facts  she reasoned correctly in regard to his  approaching marriage      no   she said calmly   it isn t even that  you talk partly for the  sake of saying things that sound effective  and partly because you are  morbid from over introspection  if you were vicious  i should say you  did it as an atonement  many people would not understand you  but as  i do  it is harmless for you to talk to me       introspective  of course  can any body help being that in this age   and as for being morbid  it all depends upon definitions  i try to be  honest with myself       the subtlest form of hypocrisy   she answered   often consists in what  we call being honest with ourselves  i gave that up long ago  you are  not honest with yourself about this marriage  if you don t wish to  marry miss caldwell  who forces you to do so       forces me to  good heavens  i do wish to marry her  of course i don t  ever expect to be perfectly happy  in this inexplicable world natures  that demand that every thing shall be explained must necessarily remain  unsatisfied  still  i d take a little more coffee as a palliation of my  lot  if you please       it is well you are to marry   observed helen  refilling his cup    you ve concentrated your attention upon yourself too long       but i am afraid of poverty  if i find some old boston duffer with a  lot of money  and can fool him into admiring the frame of one of my  pictures  he may buy it  and i can pay the butcher  the baker and the  gas man for a week  if i can t  i must daub the canvas a little higher  and try the same game in new york  and        rubbish   she interrupted   the difficulty is  you are too  self indulgent  you are too much afraid of the little discomforts       no   he answered   men  at least sensitive men  do not suffer so much  from the discomforts of poverty as from its indignities       if    began helen  but without finishing  she rose from the table   went to the window and stood looking out     fenton watched her idly  knowing perfectly that the woman before him  was capable of sacrificing for him all the little income which was  her s  and he wondered  as men will  how deep her feeling for him had  really become  and whether it had ever passed that mysterious and  undefinable line which separates love from friendship     helen had often endeavored to assist the artist out of some financial  difficulty by buying one of his unsellable pictures  a pretext which he  had the grace to put aside by refusing to sell  sometimes sending her  as a gift precisely the work for which he could most easily find a  purchaser  there was continually a silent struggle  more or less  consciously carried on between the two  although seldom appearing upon  the surface  too much fenton s friend not to be pained by his  weaknesses  helen was stung to the quick by a certain insincerity  which she often detected alike beneath his raillery and his cynicism   too noble to yield to any belief in a friend s unworthiness without  resistance  she suffered anew whenever his words seemed to ring false   and now there were tears in her eyes as she looked out into the sunny  street  she pressed them firmly back  however  and turned a calm face  towards her guest  who sat playing with his spoon and watching her with  a half troubled  half amused expression      i ve composed my epitaph   he said irrelevantly   will you please  compose my monument       oh  willingly  but it will be necessary to know the epitaph  so that  the monument may express the same sentiment       i shall have no name   arthur returned   only         l homme est mort  soit    how does that strike you       ah   she cried impulsively   how does any thing strike me  you play at  being wretched as sentimental school girls do  when in their case it is  slate pencils and pickled limes and in your case it is vanity  if you  were half as miserable as you pretend  you d have blown your brains out  long ago  or deemed yourself the veriest craven alive  i ve no patience  with such attitudinizing       you are partly right   he admitted   but do any of us find the savor  of life so sweet as to make it worth while      something in his voice  a ring of what might be pity in his tone   humiliated helen  she suspected that he thought her outburst arose from  a too great fondness for himself  for grief at parting and at giving  him up to another  she struggled to regain her calmness  she felt the  impossibility of contradicting the belief which she was sure existed in  his mind  she was conscious that to say   i do not love you   would  appear to him proof incontrovertible that the reverse was true  her  throat contracted painfully and she cast down her eyes lest the tears  in them should be seen      the caffres   fenton continued  after an instant s pause   are said to  be so fond of sugar that they will eat a handful of sand rather than  lose a grain or two that has fallen to the ground  it seems to me life  is the sand and joy in the proportion of the sugar  i m not willing to  take the sand  and i protest against it  there is no morality in it       there is no morality in any thing but death   helen returned drearily      death   echoed fenton   do you call that moral  death that crushes the  emotions  that kills the passions  that pollutes the flesh  the monster  which debauches all that is sacred in the physical  that degrades to  the level of the lowest all that is high in the intellectual  is this  your idea of the moral  the coarsest rioting of sensual life is sacred  beside it  death moral   mon dieu   helen  how you do abuse  terms      fenton was continually treading upon the dangerous edge between pathos  and bathos  between impressiveness and absurdity  had he not possessed  extremely sensitive perceptions which enabled him to judge swiftly and  exactly of the effect of his declamations  and the keenest sense of the  ludicrous that helped him to turn into ridicule whatever could not be  made to pass for earnest  much of his extravagant talk would have  excited amusement and  not impossibly  contempt  instead of producing  the half serious effect he desired  he could impart a vast air of  sincerity to his speech  moreover  and could even for the moment be  sincere  in the present case his earnest and real feeling saved this  outburst from the somewhat theatrical air which the words might easily  have had if spoken at all artificially      the history of mankind   went on the artist  in a sort of two fold  consciousness  deeply feeling on the one hand what he was saying  but  on the other endeavoring to direct the conversation to generalities in  which would be lost the dangerous personal remarks which threatened    the whole history of mankind is a protest against death as an insult   an outrage  all religions are only mankind s defiance of death more or  less largely phrased       no   helen said   not our defiance  our confession of a craven fear  i  am afraid of death  i don t dare take my life       we are talking   responded her companion  in his turn leaving the  table and approaching the window   like a couple of unmitigated ghouls   i acknowledge your right to put aside your life if it bores you  man  has at least that one inalienable right  but why should you  art is  left still       art   she repeated with profound sadness   yes  but a woman is never  content with abstractions  she demands something more definite  and  by  the way  will came to see me yesterday       yes  what did he want       he said he only came to see how i was  i think he recognizes that now  he has come from europe our secret is sure to leak out soon  and is  looking the ground over to see how it is best to behave  he was very  entertaining  i never enjoyed him more thoroughly       he s a model husband   fenton observed thoughtfully   as well as you  like each other  i ll be hanged if i can see why you don t live like  other people       it is precisely because we don t live like other people   was the  reply   that we do like each other so well  we are the best of friends   we were the worst possible husband and wife  i hated him officially   and   there  why must you bring all that up again  let the dead past  bury its dead       but the past won t bury its dead  it sits over their corpses like a  persistent resurrectionist  in a fashion which is irresistibly  disheartening  did it never strike you  by the way  what a droll  caricature might be made on that line  time as a decrepit old sexton   you know       so few people can joke on those subjects that it would appeal to a  very limited audience  i m afraid       oh  that s true of every thing that is good for any thing       unfortunately the converse is not true  for every thing appealing to a  small audience is by no means good       not even marriage       still harping on matrimony   said helen  laughing   what will you do  after the knot is really tied  you speak in the mournful tone of one  who reads   lasciate ogni speranza   upon his wedding horseshoe       oh  not quite   he laughed back   for after marriage a man can always  amuse himself  you know  by looking at any woman he may meet and  fancying how much worse off he might be if he had married her instead  of his wife       well   helen remarked  turning   your conversation is amusing and  doubtless deeply instructive  but i must go to the studio  my  bas relief will hardly complete itself  i suppose  and i ve a splendid  offer for it  to decorate a house in milton  it is to be paneled into  the side of an oak stairway at the back of the main hall  isn t that  fine            x     o  wicked wit and gift              hamlet  i           anomalies are doubtless as truly the product of law as results whose  logic is evident  and the strange relations between mrs  greyson and  her husband were therefore to be considered the outcome of fixed causes  from which no other result was possible     married when scarcely more than a girl  shy  undeveloped and ignorant  of the world  helen came from a secluded life  which had been pretty  equally divided between the library of her dead father and the woods  surrounding the country village where she lived  she had never even  fancied that she loved dr  ashton  but she had married him as she would  have obeyed any other command of the stern aunt who had presided  severely over her orphaned childhood  he  half a dozen years her  senior  had been enamored of her wonderful beauty and modest  intellectuality  and  being accustomed always to gratify the impulse of  the moment  he had married her with a precipitancy as characteristic as  it was reckless  it was owing to a certain mutual scorn of  conventionalities that helen and her husband at length decided to  separate  without the aid of the law and without scandal  they settled  back into single liberty  the wife taking again her father s name  they  had spent their married life abroad  where dr  ashton had remained  until a short time previous to the opening of our story  and as neither  husband nor wife had been in their single life known in boston  and as  helen was chary of new acquaintances  their relations had thus far  remained undiscovered  helen  at least  recognized how improbable it  was that this secrecy would long remain inviolate  but she went quietly  on her way  letting events take their own course     arthur fenton was an old friend of her husband whom helen had met in  europe  but had known intimately only during her boston life  she had  found him sympathetic  responsive and entertaining  and as any lonely  woman clings to the companionship of an appreciative man  she had clung  to the friendship and comradeship of the artist     going across the common towards the studio on this sunny morning  when  the air was brisk and bracing  the naked trees clearly and delicately  defined against the sky  helen s thoughts went back to her past  to her  shy  secluded girlhood  to the years of her married life  and to the  way in which she had been living since she and her husband parted  she  reflected with a smile  half pity  half contempt  of the proud   reticent girl who had pored over books and drawings in the musty   deserted library at home  almost wondering if she were the same being   she looked from the joy street mall across the hollow which holds the  frog pond  the most charming view on the common  yet not even the  golden sparkle of the water or the beautiful line of the slope beyond  could chase from her mind the picture of the high  dim old room  lined  to the ceiling with book shelves  dingy and dusty from neglect  she  seemed to hear still the weird tapping of the beech tree boughs against  the tall narrow windows  and still to smell odor of old leather  she  remembered vividly the dull dizziness that came from stooping too long  over some volume too heavy to hold  above which  half lying upon the  carpetless floor  she had bent with drooping golden curls  she  remembered  too  the remoteness of the real world from the ideal sphere  in which her fancy placed her  how unimportant and unsubstantial to her  had appeared the events of daily life as compared with the incidents of  the world the old books in the musty library opened to her  the life of  these magic tomes was the real  and that humdrum state through which  her visible pathway lay was the dream  to the imaginative girl  half  child  half poet  her marriage had prospectively seemed merely an  accident of the trivial outside existence which surrounded without  penetrating her true being  and the sharpness of the rude awakening  from this childish misconception still pierced the woman s proud soul     no woman recalls her childhood without regret  and despite the  philosophy she had cultivated  helen felt a deep sadness as the old  days  somber and dull though they had been  rose before her  she  hurried her step a little as if to escape her past  when a pleasant  voice at her elbow said      good morning  helen  upon what wickedness are you bent now  you go too  fast to be on a good errand       good morning  will   she answered  without turning  for the voice  brought the speaker before her mental vision as plainly as her eyes  could have done   i was just thinking of you  and of the days when you  found me at home       yes   responded dr  ashton   what were you thinking of them       nothing very pleasant   she answered with a sigh   what a gorgeous day  it is  arthur has been breakfasting with me       arthur is going to be married   remarked her companion good humoredly    i ve just been out to buy him a wedding present       what is it       oh  something he chose himself  it is not safe to tell you  though       haven t i proved my discretion   helen said lightly   i thought that  by this time you d be willing to trust me with your most deadly  secrets       this is a deadly secret  indeed   he returned  taking from his pocket  a small morocco case      oh  jewelry   helen said  with an accent of disappointment   i should  never have suspected you of such commonplaceness  will       not jewelry  a jewel   retorted dr  ashton  opening the case and  displaying a tiny vial      will   helen exclaimed  stopping suddenly and catching her husband by  the arm   you won t give him that       why not  i promised him long ago that i d get it for him  and he  particularly asked for it as a wedding gift       oh  will  don t do it  he ll use it sometime when he s blue  he ll          nonsense   responded the physician  restoring the case to his pocket    i ve diagnosed his case perfectly  he isn t very robust  he s  infernally sensitive  and he s no end morbid  he fancies he may want to  kill himself  and i dare say he will have leanings that way  most of us  do  he has wanted to a good many times before now  and he is likely to  again  but he won t do it  he s too soft hearted  he might get up steam  enough as far as courage goes  but he d never forget other people and  their opinion  he couldn t bear to hurt others  and still less could he  bear the idea of their blaming him  he is precisely the man who cannot  take his own life       but what puts it into his head just now  why should he marry if he  dreads it so       it is all of a piece with his morbidness  he is really in love with  miss caldwell  i think  but he has brooded over the matter as he broods  over every thing  and seeing the uncertain nature of matrimony  he like  a wise man provides for contingencies  there may be something behind  that i don t know of  but i think not  he ll feel easier if he has  this  and i am honestly doing him a favor  if it isn t in the way he  thinks       i do not know   persisted helen   but i do wish you wouldn t do it   how would his bride feel if she knew       i don t know her   dr  ashton returned coolly   so of course i can t  tell how sensible she is  but in any case i can trust arthur s  discretion       she s orthodox   said helen   or  no  i think she is not so bad as  that  but she would regard the idea of suicide as unspeakably wicked   at least i think so  i never saw her but once  oh  i do hate to have  arthur marry her  it s dreadful       of course  it s dreadful to think of any man s marrying  for that  matter   he returned with a smile   but he is a man who was sure to do  it sooner or later       he s a man of so much principle   helen mused  half aloud      principle   sneered her companion laughingly   principle is only  formulated policy       i am dreadfully tired of epigrams   sighed helen as they walked down  west street   whether arthur learned the habit of you or you of him i  don t know  but the pair of you are enough to corrupt all boston  i do  wish you d give me that case  i m sure i need it far more than arthur  does  he s going to be married  his pictures are praised and are  beginning to sell  he has life before him and every thing to live for   while i have nothing       life is before you  too   answered her husband gravely  putting his  hand upon her arm to prevent her flying under the wheels of a carriage  which in her absorption she had not noticed   look here  helen  it  wouldn t be any better if arthur wanted to marry you  you are too  melancholy alone without having him to push you deeper into the slough  of despond       you are mistaken  will   was the quiet response   i am fond of arthur   very fond  indeed  but not in that way  i am a fool to grieve about his  marriage  i own that  though after all i ve lived through i ought to be  too hardened to care  but you must acknowledge that it isn t very  pleasant for me to see him deliberately going away to marry a woman who  would consider me a bohemian  and very likely anything but respectable   because you and i choose to be comfortable apart instead of miserable  together  if i were not so utterly alone in the world  losing a friend  would not be so great a matter  perhaps  but he is all i have now   will       it is hard  old lady  that s a fact  i wish i could straighten things  out for you  but i don t see how i can       no   helen said drearily   nobody can            xi     whom the fates have marked        comedy of errors  i   i       upon entering the small studio where her bas relief stood  helen found  herman there before her  he had removed the wet cloths from the clay  and was examining the work with close attention      you need a model for this figure   he said  indicating the month of  may   you must take that turn of the shoulder from nothing but life      helen came and stood beside him  looking at the work  the instinct of  the artist for the moment superseded all other feelings in her mind   and she forgot alike her own troubles and the ill omened gift with  which her husband purposed remembering the nuptials of her friend     the figure of may of which herman spoke was that of a beautiful young  girl casting backward a wistful look at the fallen flowers which she  had dropped but might not stay to gather up again  the splendid  movement of the youthful figure  thrown forward in her running  but  with one shoulder turned toward the spectator  so that the upper  portion of the beautiful bosom was seen  formed one of the finest  details of the composition      yes   the sculptor said again   you must have a model for that  and i  have one coming this morning  to be honest  i came up here hoping you d  need her  i believe she is a good girl  and i do not like the idea of  her being about among the studios      he went on to speak of the figure  adding suggestions of treatment   feeling and posing  and as he talked he was conscious of needlessly  prolonging the conversation for the mere pleasure of being near this  woman  and of secretly cherishing some vague feeling that not only  would ninitta be safe under mrs  greyson s guardianship  but that some  solution of the complexities in which he found himself involved would  result from bringing together the two women so closely connected with  his life     he went away into his own studio at length  but helen had scarcely got  fairly to work before he reappeared with ninitta     ninitta was much the same in outward appearance as upon the previous  day  but between this morning s mental state and that of yesterday  there was a great gulf  the italian s character was a strange if not  wholly unique mixture of simplicity and worldly wisdom  all her  experiences  her life as a model in various parts of the world  her  hardships and successes  while teaching her only too sharply the  follies and vices of mankind  had never for an instant shaken her faith  in grant herman  he was her god  it is even doubtful if any thing he  could have done would have destroyed her belief in his integrity and  nobility of soul  when he left her  she acquiesced  it is true  but  with a wild passion of anguish  she knew he misjudged  but she chose to  phrase it to herself that he was deceived  his rashness and  hot headedness were to her only so many fresh evidences of his  greatness of character  she was not the first woman who has vaguely felt  that unreasoning jealousy and passion are admirable or even  essential attributes of virility  and who has worshiped a man as much  for his faults as for his virtues     to the dream of meeting herman with the proofs that he had been  deceived  ninitta had clung unyieldingly through the dreary years since  the death of hoffmeir  who had been kind to her for the sake of his  shattered friendship with herman  and for the sake  too  of his own  hopeless love for herself  it was from mingled shyness and pride that  ninitta had waited for a summons from the sculptor after she had  reached boston  but when she had at last gone to his studio it was with  keen emotion  she had not considered that both herself and her old time  lover had changed in the seven years of separation  she had not  reflected that believing her false he could not but have endeavored to  forget her  she could not know that contact with the world  if it had  not made him ashamed of his youthful enthusiasm  had at least showed  him how the marriage he had contemplated would have appeared in the  eyes of worldly wisdom  and had so educated him that reason was less  helpless before passion than of old     but to day ninitta was a different woman  changed by the agony of a  night into which had been compressed the bitterness of years  she had  been too sharply wounded at being greeted by a hand shake in place of  the too well remembered kisses  with commonplace kind inquiries instead  of an embrace  not to realize at least how entirely the relations  between herself and herman were changed  she did not understand the  alteration  it is true  to do that would have required not only a  knowledge of facts of which she could have no cognizance  but far  keener powers of reason than were centered in ninitta s shapely head   only of one thing she was sure  there the instinct of her sex stood her  in good stead  she was convinced that some other woman had won the  sculptor s love from her  when she came into helen s studio this  morning she watched sharply for some token which should show her the  relations in which the two artists stood to each other  but she could  detect nothing significant  mrs  greyson was intent only upon her work   and whatever the sculptor may have felt at the meeting of helen and  ninitta  he made no outward sign     the model showed a quickness of comprehension in taking the pose  required  and the shoulder she bared was of so exquisite mold that  helen s keenest artistic powers were aroused  ninitta understood the  art of posing as a painter knows the use of brush and colors  she had  for it an inborn capacity impossible except in the child of an art  land  moved by the inspiration of that most beautiful bust  mrs   greyson worked enthusiastically  scarcely noticing when her master left  the room  an indication of indifference which the model did not fail to  note           xii     what time she chanted            hamlet  iv           it was february  and the night but one before the day fixed for arthur  fenton s marriage  he was spending the evening with mrs  greyson  and  it chanced that grant herman and fred rangely were also there  the  sculptor went seldom to the house of his pupil  and when he did visit  her  he satisfied some fine  secret delicacy by taking always a friend  with him  helen was sufficiently bohemian or sufficiently unworldly to  care little if people criticised her way of living  she had inherited a  small property which made her comfortable and independent  and she  declined being hampered by a chaperon      my art is my chaperon   she wrote to an elderly relative who wished to  come to boston and matronize her   a woman who is daring enough to be  an artist is regarded as bold enough to take care of herself  i  suppose  at least nobody troubles me  and i ask nothing more      on the present occasion arthur fenton asked leave to light his cigar   and although herman felt this something of a profanation  it was not  long before he and rangely added their wreaths to the smoke garlands  which hung upon the air  and had not the hostess become somewhat  accustomed to tobacco in foreign  ateliers   it is to be doubted  if she could have complacently endured the fumes which arose     all subjects of heaven and earth came drifting into the talk  and at  length something evoked from rangely his opinion of emerson      emerson was great   he said   emerson often recalled goethe in  goethe s cooler and more intellectual moods  but emerson lacked the  loftiness of vice  he was eternally narrow        the loftiness of vice    echoed the hostess   what does that mean  it  sounds vicious enough       emerson   rangely returned   knew only half of life  he never had any  conception of the passionate longing for vice  per se   the  thrill  the glow which comes to some men at the splendid caress of sin  in her most horrible shape  do you see what i mean  he couldn t imagine  the ecstasy that may lie in mere foulness       no   replied helen   i m afraid i don t quite see  though i am sure i  ought to be shocked  do you mean that he should have been vicious       certainly not  but it was his limitation not to be tempted  not to be  able to project himself into a personality which riots in wickedness  far more intensely than a saint follows righteousness       if you mean that he could not have been wicked if he tried  that  i  own  was in a sense a limitation       yes  and a fatal one  no man can be wholly great who understands only  one half of human impulses       but what do you mean by wickedness   demanded herman  a little  combatively      oh   laughed rangely   i m not to be entrapped into giving  metaphysical and theological definitions  i mean what we are expected  to call wickedness  conventionally speaking  i ve an old cad of a  parson in my new play and i am trying to decide if it will do to have  him advocate a grand scheme for reforming the world by reversing  definitions and calling those things men choose to do virtues  and  dubbing whatever man detests  vices       that is rather more clever than orthodox   helen laughed   how is your  play getting on  mr  rangely       oh  fairish  thank you  the trouble is that the drama went out of  fashion long ago  first they replaced it by dresses and scenery  but  now every thing has given way to souvenir programmes  so i ve got to  write up to a souvenir or i sha n t make any thing out of the play       i hoped you were above such mercenary considerations       i am trying to make myself so   he retorted   i think about three  successful plays would be tonic enough to bring my conscience up to  proper art levels      herman had taken little part in this colloquy  smoking in silence  and  regarding his companions  fenton had thus far been even more quiet   scarcely contributing a word to the conversation  and the sculptor s  thoughts turned upon the handsome young fellow  sitting in one of his  favorite twisted attitudes in a german chair  his beardless face paler  than usual  though a red spot glowed in either cheek  and his dilated  pupils betrayed his excitement  he was smoking steadily  but with  little apparent knowledge of either his cigar or his surroundings      upon my word   mused herman   a cheerful looking man for a bridegroom  he is  if he were going to the scaffold he could hardly seem more  melancholy  what in the world is the matter with him  i wonder if he  has been dragged into a marriage he doesn t like  how mrs  greyson  watches him      helen was indeed watching fenton closely  although to a less keen  observer than herman her surveillance would hardly have been apparent   she  too  was thinking of fenton s downcast air  and knowing him more  intimately than did the sculptor  she reasoned less doubtfully   although perhaps not more accurately than the latter concerning what  was passing in the mind of her silent friend      he surely loves miss caldwell   she thought   but he is so foolish  he  is thinking now that he will never meet these comrades again as an  unhampered man  he feels just now all he is giving up  i should like  him better to remember what he is gaining  are all men inherently  selfish  i wonder  it is well for miss caldwell s peace of mind that  she cannot see him now  perhaps when he is with her he sees only the  other side  i am sure i hope so      she turned away with a sigh  and saw herman looking at her  their eyes  met in one of those brief glances of intelligence which serve as fine  fibers to knit people together     the conversation soon turned upon the opinion a certain critic had  expressed concerning a picture then on exhibition      bah   cried fenton suddenly   what does he know about art   he is  bow legged       hallo   exclaimed rangely   have you waked up  i thought we were safe  from you for the whole evening       it is never safe to count on his silence   herman said   he has  probably been meditating some stinging epigram against woman  we shall  have something wild directly       no  i ve nothing to say against women now   arthur returned  rising    for i want mrs  greyson to sing  i wish you d stop poisoning the air  with those confounded cigarettes  fred  the use of cigarettes degrades  smoking to the level of the small vices  and i object to it on  principle      he opened the piano as he spoke  and without demur helen allowed him to  lead her to the instrument      if you do not mind   she said a little diffidently  turning to her  guests after she had seated herself   i should like to have the gas  lowered a trifle  it may seem a little sentimental  but i do not like  to be looked at too keenly when i sing      the flames of the gas jets were dimmed  and helen struck a few soft  chords  herman listened intently  he had heard fenton praise mrs   greyson s singing  but he was entirely unprepared for what was to come   and he never forgot the thrill of that experience     an unpretending  flowing prelude  then suddenly the tones of the  singer     helen s voice was a rich  fibrous mezzo soprano  and the music she  sang  half chant  half melody  was evidently an improvisation  the  words were the exquisite song which opens shelley s  hellas        i strew these opiate flowers  on thy restless pillow     they were plucked from orient bowers   by the indian billow   be thy sleep  calm and deep   like theirs who fell  not ours who weep     away  unlovely dreams   away  false shapes of sleep     be his  as heaven seems   clear and bright and deep   soft as love and calm as death   sweet as summer night without a breath     sleep  sleep  my song is laden  with the soul of slumber   it was sung by a samian maiden  whose lover was of the number  who now keep  that calm sleep  whence none may wake  where none shall weep     i touch thy temples pale   i breathe my soul on thee   and could my prayers avail   all my joy should be  dead  and i would live to weep   so thou might st win one hour of quiet sleep       it is difficult to convey the effect of this song upon its hearers  the  strangeness  the unconventionality of the recitative  the wonderful   sad beauty of the poem  the dim light through which helen s vibrating   passionate voice thrilled  all helped to impress the hearers  there was  a personal quality about the chant which made it seem like a direct  appeal from the singer to the heart of each listener  it came to each  as a spontaneous outflowing of the singer s innermost self  a  confidence made in mystic wise  sacred and inviolable  and setting him  honored by receiving it forever from the common multitude of men  it  was an appeal to some unspoken and unspeakable bond of fealty  which  made the pulses throb and great emotions stir in the breast  before  hearing one would be stubbornly incredulous of the possibility of his  being so deeply affected  afterward he would remember how he had been  moved with wonder and longing     especially was grant herman much moved  thoughts came into his mind of  the old minstrels chanting to their harps  he seemed to hear sappho  singing again in the gardens of mytilene  this was the woman he loved   and he felt himself as never before surrounded palpably by her  presence  the improvisation was a part of herself as no other music  could have been  and in some subtle  sensuous way  the lover seemed for  the moment to be one with his beloved  his eyes filled with tears in a  sort of ecstasy  and he shrank back into the shadow lest some of his  friends should detect the glad  salt drops which no eyes but hers had a  right to see           xiii     the great assay of art            macbeth  iv           a hush followed the conclusion of mrs  greyson s song     no one wished to speak what all felt  and when the silence was broken   it was with talk of the poet rather than of the singer  to the singing  they came only by slow degrees  and over it  when at length their  admiration found speech  they passed lightly     one thing which seemed to be effected by the music was the awakening of  fenton from his gloomy reverie  he began to talk in his most  extravagant and whimsical style  answering every question instantly  if  with no especial care concerning the relevancy of his replies      what nonsense it is   he exclaimed   to talk of any man s originating  any thing  why  when even adam couldn t be made without material  what  are we  his descendants  that we should hope to create  the authors of  this old wisdom that we revamp to day copied somebody further back  and  those in turn put down what the masses felt  collected the foam which  gathered on the yeasty waves of their age  every truth comes to the  people first if they could only recognize it when it comes  it is  evolved by the friction of the masses  just as a fire is set by the  rubbing together of tree boughs in primeval forests  and the dusky  redman incontinently roasted in his uncontaminated innocence  the  longer i live the less faith i have that a man evolves any thing from  his inner consciousness  fancies are only the lies of the mendacious  brain  which perceives one thing and declares to us another       go slow  fenton   interrupted herman   you know our poor wits are apt  to be dazzled by too much brilliancy       the age   fenton rattled on   blooms once into a great man as an aloe  into a crown of bloom       right in there   broke in rangely  who longed for a share in the  conversation   just consider how necessary it is that every art  producer shall be in sympathy with the human life about him  that he  should take the best wherever it is to be found  there s a miserable  sentiment about shutting one s self up in some dark corner  and  producing some tremendous thing  don t you know how many new york and  boston artists have gone to europe and hermetically sealed themselves  up somewhere to ferment into greatness like a jug of cider turning into  vinegar in a farmer s cellar       that s what made hunt such a big fellow   herman interposed   because  he took the good wherever it offered       but that depends upon whether a man goes direct to nature for  inspiration   declared fenton   or sets himself to get a living by  filching the good things his neighbors have won from her       hunt did go to nature  that is just where he was great       i think   said fred  laughingly   that you will appreciate the mood in  which i once wrote a preface  i planned a great metaphysical and  philosophical work  i was a good deal younger than i am now  and the  preface was to be   as to the originality of these ideas  i have  nothing more to say than that i do not remember that they have ever  been printed with my name on the title page   of course  after that  declaration  i felt at liberty to take any thing i wanted from any  where  but  unluckily  my book never got beyond the preface       i m glad you had the sense to stop there   declared arthur   i forgive  the preface  but i could never have forgiven the book      helen rose from her seat at the piano and turned up the gas a little   the effect for which the light had been lowered was secured  and it was  better  she recognized  to give to her singing a certain isolation   which must be done before the conversation became so general that the  change from gloom to light would not be noticed     she wore that evening a gray silk with black lace  a slight turning  away showing the whiteness of her beautiful throat  her jewels were  cats  eyes      do you wear your cats  eyes in honor of the cat headed deity of the  pagans  mrs  greyson   rangely asked  as she paused near his chair   watching a burner which seemed disposed to flicker      no   returned she  smiling   i am no follower of your pasht  a goddess  of  winged words  attracts me less than a deity whose province is the  sacred sphere of silence  my dress is of mr  fenton s designing  he is  deeply versed in the subject of clothes  i even suspect him of being  the true author of   sartor resartus         that brings up my pet abomination   fenton observed  with emphasis   i  do hate carlyle  i ve even lain awake nights to think how i d like to  pound his head  the self conceited  self centered  self adoring old  humbug  he was the sham  par excellence  of the nineteenth  century  this century of shams       it s something to be at the top of the heap in anything   interpolated  herman   even in shams       the trouble with carlyle   fenton continued   besides his enormous  egotism  was that he never got beyond the whim that the truth is  something absolute  he could not abide the idea that it is merely a  relative thing and must be treated as such  if he d got above the mass  of cloudy vapor he called truth  he might have gained a glimpse of real  sunlight  but his aggressive self conceit clogged his wings  don t you  recognize that a lie is often truer than the truth   he ran on  sitting  up in his chair and speaking more rapidly   that where the truth will  often produce an erroneous impression  a lie will convey a correct one   that to be true to the spirit it is often necessary to violate the  letter       your patron saint should be the god of falsehood   helen said lightly    i fear your allegiance to pasht is not very sincere       ah  but it is   retorted he  quickly   my allegiance is to the goddess  of  winged words   to the glorious mother of fictitious speech  to  pasht  the goddess of splendid  golden lying  a lie is only the truth  agreeably and effectively told   vive la faussete        doubtless each interprets pasht s attributes according to his own  light   herman observed  a little grimly     he was only half pleased with fenton s badinage  but the latter   apparently  did not feel the thrust      let him alone   helen said   he believes in nothing  he is a genuine  pagan       you are wrong in your idea   was fenton s swift reply   a true pagan  must have a belief in some god to take from his shoulders the burden of  personal responsibility  or he cannot be joyous as a pagan should   however  to night i make myself believe that i believe something  so it  comes to much the same thing      helen turned and looked at him  attracted by some subtle quality in his  voice     he was sitting sidewise in his chair  holding an ivory paper knife in  his slender fingers  his cheeks burned  his eyes were bright  his lips  red  he had shaken off the depression which oppressed him earlier in  the evening  an air of joyous  quivering excitement pervaded him  he  threw up his head with a characteristic gesture  and looked about him  like one who has conquered in some desperate conflict      come   the hostess said  wondering in what inward struggle he had come  off victor   you promised to assist me with the coffee  i make no boast  of my house or my hospitality  gentlemen   she added  with a charming  glance around   but i warn you in advance that not to admire my coffee  is to lose my friendship forever      in answer to her ring  a servant brought in a small mortar and a pretty  little bowl of whole coffee  delicately browned  and scarcely cold from  its roasting  arthur  who seemed acquainted with mrs  greyson s methods  of procedure  began to pound the berries  roasted to perfect crispness   in the ebony mortar  reducing them to an almost impalpable powder   which diffused upon the air the entrancing odor dear to the nostrils of  all artists     the servant meantime had provided tiny cups  a little copper ibrik and  an alcohol lamp over which simmered a vessel of boiling water      coffee should be prepared only over coals of perfumed wood   helen  remarked as she measured into the ibrik the small spoonful of coffee  dust designed for a single cup   but alcohol is the next best thing  it  burns with such a supernatural flame      she put into the ibrik a measure of boiling water  rested it an instant  over the flame to restore the heat lost in the cooler copper  and then  poured the beverage into the egg shell cup destined for it      to my master first   she said  presenting the steaming cup to herman   who received it much as one might a gift from the skies   i learned my  coffee making   she continued   from an old arab at cairo  who used to  say that it was one of the only two things in life worth doing  the  other being the duties of religion  and it therefore should be  perfectly done       it is simply divine   the sculptor said   i have never really tasted  coffee before  only if it is made like this your arab might have said  there was but one thing in life  for this becomes a religious duty    one by one with equal care were prepared cups for the others  who were  neither slow nor perfunctory in their endorsement of the sculptor s  praise           xiv     this is not a boon       othello  iii                 i strew these opiate flowers      on thy restless pillow       hummed grant herman to himself  taking his lonely way down the dim and  dingy streets leading to the wharves where he had his abode           i strew these opiate flowers       oh  what a woman she is  she might be brunhilde  or she might be burd  helen          i strew these       i wonder what she had to say to fenton that she made him stay  confound  that fellow  i m not more than half sure that i m fond of him  though i  can t bring myself fairly and squarely to dislike him  but i wish he  didn t know mrs  greyson quite so well  he s going to be married  too   i wonder how he came to know her  any how  it is strange she doesn t  wear black if she is a widow  i d like to learn something more definite  about her  but fenton s the only one who would be likely to know  and i  certainly will not ask him  i suppose he is there yet  lounging in some  sort of an outlandish shape      arthur was indeed still in helen s parlor  and in as crooked an  attitude as a man ever compassed  he had so managed to dispose of  himself over three chairs as to give the general effect of having been  suddenly arrested in the midst of an acrobatic feat of unusual  difficulty  and with a cigar in his long  nervous fingers  was watching  mrs  greyson  who occupied herself in tidying the room a little      we have been too good friends   she said   to say good by in public   the old days have been pleasant  and it is hard to give them up       you have insisted upon it that they are gone forever   he returned    until i almost begin to believe you  but it is no matter   che sara  sara        yes   che sara sara    she echoed   but now are you willing to do  me a favor  i haven t asked many of you       you certainly deserve that i should say yes without a quibble    replied fenton   but your air is so serious that i do not dare run the  risk  so i will merely answer   i would like to do you a favor if i  may      she came and sat down near him  a beautiful woman  flushed and tender   it arose perhaps from the delicate sensitiveness of both that they had  always instinctively avoided those chance contacts which between lovers  become so significant  confining themselves to rare hand shakes at  meeting and parting  and it may be that their very scrupulousness in  this matter proves how near they had been to more emotional relations  than those of simple friendship  now when helen laid her hand upon her  friend s arm it marked an earnestness which showed how much she felt  what she was about to say      i want you to give me something that will gave you the other day      fenton s first feeling was one of annoyance  but this was quickly  replaced by a desire to fathom the motives which prompted her request      how did you know of it   he asked      by divination   she answered  with a faint smile   will you give it to  me       why should i       because i ask you       to go back to that  then  why do you ask me       because i cannot bear to think of your going to be married with that  in your possession  because it is cruel for you so to wrong miss  caldwell as to marry her while you find it possible to think it may  lead you to  to use that  how can you do it  you know i ve no sympathy  with those who call it cowardly to take one s life  i think we ve a  right to do that sometimes  perhaps  but it is cowardly to many a woman  with the deliberate idea of escaping her if you are not happy  of  deserting her after you have inextricably involved her life in yours   you ve no right to do that if you mean to make it a tragedy       she is involved in my life already   he returned gravely   and it is a  tragedy  but i am not so wholly selfish as you assume  honestly  helen   it is for her sake as much  at least  as my own that i wanted that  vial  it is all like a scene in  the city of dreadful night   i  cannot be sure that i may not have to kill myself for her happiness   heaven knows i have not found myself so good company as to have very  strong reasons to suppose that any body else will       no   helen said   that is sophistry  i am a woman and i have been a  wife  i know what i say  you have no right to marry any woman and allow  the existence of such a possibility  it may not be logic  but it is  true       but she will not know       she may not know  but she will feel  you are too finely strung not to  discover to a delicate ear any discord  no matter how hard you try to  conceal it  and the ear of a woman who loves is sensitive to the  slightest changes  no  arthur  if you have any love for her  any  friendship for me  any respect for yourself  give me that vial      he made no answer to her appeal for a moment  although she clasped his  arm more tightly and looked beseechingly into his face  it was one of  those moments when he gave way to his best impulses  when he indulged  in the pleasure of letting his higher nature vibrate in response to  appeals addressed to it  and for the instant tasted the intoxicating  pleasure of conscious virtue  he turned to scrutinize her more closely      but what would you do with it  helen      she started a little  she had not been without a half formed thought  that she should be glad to have the deadly gift with its power of swift  oblivion in her possession  although until now she had scarcely been  conscious of it  but she saw that some suspicion of this was present in  arthur s mind  and must be allayed before she could hope to accomplish  her purpose      you are wrong   she said quickly   it is for your own sake that i want  you to give it up  i will do whatever you like with it  i pledge you my  word that i will never use it myself      he still made no movement to surrender the vial  but she held out her  hand      come   she pleaded   i appeal to your best self  for the sake of your  mother  arthur   you have told me you could refuse her nothing she  asked  and she would surely ask this if she were alive and knew  give  it to me      he slowly drew from some inner pocket the little morocco case and held  it in both hands looking at it      it is a comfort to me   he said   it means an end of every thing  it  means annihilation  it means getting rid of this nightmare of  existence  i can remember when i dreaded the idea of annihilation  but  i have come to feel that it is the only good to be desired  to be done  with every thing and to forget every thing  don t you see  helen  i  should never be satisfied with any thing short of omnipotence and  omniscience  and annihilation is the only refuge for a nature like  that  i want to be everything  to feel the joy of the conqueror and yet  not miss the keen  fine pang of the conquered  lowell says it  somewhere  to be         both maiden and lover       i forget it   bee and clover  you know  to be the  red slayer  and  the  slain  both  do you wonder i want to keep this      a feeling of helplessness and hopelessness came over helen  only half  consciously she spoke a thought aloud      you are half mad from introspection      he turned upon her a quizzical smile      i dare say   said he   it isn t a comfortable process either  if a man  has lived twenty five years  helen  and has not so entangled his life  in a web of circumstances that no power will ever be able to  extricate it  he may consider his first quarter century of existence a  success      he spoke with a bitter good humor not uncommon with him  and he  believed himself sincere  he even mentally applauded himself for the  justness of the sentiment  and was not untouched with pity for a being  in whom such sadness was possible  it may have been this secret  complacency that helen detected in his face and fancied it a sign of  relenting  she put out her hand and took hold of the morocco case   arthur did not release his hold  yet neither did his grasp tighten  and  she drew the dangerous gift out of his fingers     she sprang up and locked it away in a cabinet      there   she exclaimed  standing before him in a sudden revulsion of  feeling  her face flushed and her eyes shining   now i will tell you  what i think of you  i think you mean to be good to others  but        you always think better of me than i deserve   he interrupted   at  least you treat me better       that does not necessarily indicate any leniency of judgment   retorted  helen   i think you are self centered  and morbid  and if marriage  doesn t reform you  i give you up  for nothing will  suffering is only  an effect  the cause is sensibility  and you keep yourself abnormally  sensitive by having yourself always upon the vivisection table      she turned and walked away from him  her emotion was getting beyond her  control  her friendships were keen with the intensity of her passionate  nature  she had not passed through this struggle lightly  and perhaps  the victory unnerved her more than defeat would have done  on his part  he endeavored to turn every thing off as usual with a jest      have i told you bently s latest   he began   he        it is of no use   she said  returning to him  tears overflowing her  eyes   you cannot help my making a spectacle of myself  and you had  better go  oh  arthur  i hope so much for you  i do so hope for  happiness coming to you out of this marriage  but i shall be so  lonely      her voice broke despite her effort  she came nearer  she hesitated an  instant  then she bent over and kissed his forehead  a hot tear  splashed upon his hand      there   she said   good night  and good by  when you come back you  will see what a fine steady old lady i have become      he got on to his feet  confused  troubled  pitying her profoundly and  commiserating himself upon the awkwardness of the situation  he tried  to frame some sentence which might bridge the distance that seemed  suddenly to have opened between them  like a farewell  a renunciation  or a dedication  that kiss impressed upon him a certain remoteness new  and oppressive      bah   he broke off   i can say nothing  helen  i have thus far served  in an already sufficiently unhappy world only to make people more  miserable still  i m not worth a faintest regret  good night  if i can  ever serve you  good by            xv      twas wondrous pitiful              othello  i          helen s first conscious sensation next morning was a feeling of loss   which resolved itself into a deep sadness when she was fairly awake and  realized that arthur had gone  she had not considered how much his  companionship and friendliness had been to her until now  when she felt  them lost  a woman so lonely yet so affectionate as helen could not  spare from her life a friend so dear as fenton had been without being  much moved  so strong had been her attachment  and so intimate had been  the acquaintance between herself and arthur  that dr  ashton had  believed his wife to love the artist  but helen  closely questioning  her heart  was able to assure herself that warm as had been her regard  for fenton  he had never awakened in her bosom a single thrill of love   she was sad this morning with the sorrow of a broken friendship  not of  a blighted passion     she sighed deeply  the sigh of one but too well accustomed to life s  disappointments  and arose the determination to lose herself in her  work  and to shake off if possible the sadness which seemed to paralyze  her energies and enervate her whole being     the gown which she had worn upon the previous evening lay over a chair   giving out  as she lifted it  an odor of tobacco smoke  some remark  made by grant herman about the fumes which had filled the little parlor  came into her mind  giving a new current to her thoughts  she  unconsciously fell to thinking of the sculptor  and  by a natural  connection of ideas  of ninitta  who was still nominally posing for  her     partly from interest in the girl herself and partly from the perception  that it pleased her master to have the italian remain with her  she had  retained ninitta  although the bas relief was so far advanced that the  model was hardly needed  she had even set herself  by those unobtrusive  ways at the command of gracious women  to win the girl s confidence   not so much for the sake of hearing her story as to give the waif so  strangely cast in her path the feeling that the friendship she so  sorely needed was within her reach  it had resulted  however  in her  hearing ninitta s history  many women have no idea of returning  kindness save by unreserved confidence  and although ninitta was  perhaps scarcely to be reckoned among these extremists  she yet found  so much comfort in pouring out her sorrows to one who could both  sympathize and appreciate  that little by little the whole pathetic  tale was told      i did not understand   ninitta said once in her broken english   when  he left rome  it was as if somebody had taken my life away somehow  i  couldn t make it seem that i was really alive all the same  though i  knew it could not be his fault  he would not have done it if he had  known  you do not believe he would have left me if he had known the  truth       no   helen answered   he could not have left you if he had known  it  was because he was hurt so much  and that could only be because he  loved you so much       he loved me so much   poor ninitta repeated murmuringly   he loved me  so much      and all that day she followed helen with wistful eyes  as if she longed  to hear her say again those precious words      i cannot tell you what it was like in paris   she said at another  time   in rome they all knew me  they knew i was betrothed  and no one  ever troubled me  but in paris it was different  oh  i hate paris  and  it was so cruel that he was not there  it was so dreadful that he  should be on the other side of that horrible sea      the girl was so self forgetful in these revelations  she spoke always  with such an unshaken faith in herman and was so free from any thought  of blaming him  that helen could not but be touched  she soothed poor  ninitta as well as she was able  having power to promise nothing   seeing no way out of the entanglement  yet at least showing to the  lonely italian that her woman s heart bled for her sorrow if she might  not alleviate it  sometimes she felt like going to the sculptor and  entreating him to take pity upon the girl who so adoringly loved him   once when the model had told her how just as she had saved by long   painful economy  nearly money enough to pay the passage to america it  was stolen and she was forced to begin the slow process over again   helen impulsively left her studio and found herself on the very  threshold of herman s door before she realized what she had been about  to do  by what authority was she to interfere in a matter like this  if  ninitta loved the sculptor who had long ago ceased to return her  affection  could matters be helped by an unloving marriage  it was not  for her  moreover  to give unasked her advice to such a man as she knew  grant herman to be  if he consulted her  she reflected  she might  present the pathetic  touching story which ninitta had told her  but  she had plainly no pretext for forcing her feelings upon her master  unsought     she turned and went slowly up the stairs toward her little room  but  suddenly she paused  she had all at once become conscious that she  desired eagerly to know the nature of the sculptor s feelings toward  his old love  why  she asked herself  was she so interested in what  after all did not personally concern her  a quick emotion  almost too  vague to be called a thought  made her cheek flame      no  no   she said half aloud   it is only that i am touched by  ninitta s sadness  it is nothing more      but her breath came more quickly  and it was with difficulty that upon  re entering her studio she assumed a quiet mien  lest her model should  guess at her unfulfilled errand     on the morning following the meeting of the pagans at her rooms  helen  was alone in her studio  she had told ninitta she should be late and  the latter was therefore tardy in arriving  mrs  greyson uncovered her  bas relief  now rapidly nearing completion  and stood before it   examining critically its merits and defects  a familiar step in the  passage  a tap at the door  and grant herman joined her      you look as fresh as ever this morning   he said   i feared that the  entertaining of such a company of bohemians would have tired you out       no  indeed   she returned   i am of far too much endurance to be worn  out by any thing of that sort  i have a drop of bohemian blood in my  veins myself  i think  and i like to meet men as men  when they are  simply good fellows together  i mean  a woman usually sees men in an  attitude of either deference or defense  and there is something  inspiriting to her in being occasionally received as a comrade       there are few women who can be received so   returned herman   i  suppose it requires both an especial temperament and especial  experiences to render a woman capable of being a comrade to men      the talk drifted away to general and indifferent subjects  broken here  and there by allusions and criticisms relating to the flight of the  months  and not infrequently dropping into brief silences  one of these  herman broke by saying abruptly      you do not know how your song has haunted me all night  i have been  saying over and over to myself         i strew these opiate flowers      on thy restless pillow      and  indeed  i longed for some such soporific myself before morning   your coffee or your song  or  yourself    he hesitated over the last  word  kept me very effectually awake       it must have been the coffee  there was little potency in either of  the other causes       there is much   he returned resolutely  advancing a step nearer   mrs   greyson  i have not wasted the night  i have thought out a great many  things  the first and chief being in regard to yourself      his tone  the piercing glow of his eyes  warned helen what was coming   she thought of ninitta  and retreated a step      it is true   the sculptor continued  as if answering the doubt implied  by her movement   that i       the door opened softly and ninitta came in     his outstretched hand dropped  the words died upon his lips  he turned  from one woman to the other an appealing look of hopeless sadness and  left the studio in silence     it was characteristic of helen s generosity that her first thought  should be of the pain which ninitta must feel  one glance at the model  was sufficient to show that the italian had comprehended enough of the  interrupted scene to be made wretched  but it did not then occur to  mrs  greyson that to ninitta s jealous soul  unsuspicious of herman   the only explanation of a fondness between the sculptor and his pupil  lay in an effort on the part of the latter to win from the model her  rightful and long betrothed lover           xvi     cruel proof of this man s strength                  as you like it  i           grant herman sat in his studio in the gathering twilight thinking  gloomily  however little mrs  greyson suspected the tumult which would  be aroused in ninitta s breast by the misadventure of the morning  the  sculptor was too well aware of the italian s passionate nature not to  dread the consequences of the jealousy she was sure to feel  he knew   moreover  that ninitta s rage would vent itself not upon him but upon  helen  and he wondered how best to avert the danger that threatened     he debated with himself  too  how much he owed to the girl who gave her  life up so unreservedly to him  his old love   call it rather mere  boyish passion   he thought scornfully  was long since dead beyond  hope  yet the devotion which it had awakened in ninitta burned on as  steadily as ever  had he now a right to repulse the love he had himself  called into being  to throw aside the fondness he had himself fostered  and which he had once prized above measure      no   he thought   a thousand times no  a man must be a villain who  would not marry a girl under such circumstances  i am hers  the fact  that i have changed is my misfortune  not her fault  if i have any  manliness about me  i won t let things go on in this way any longer   i ll marry ninitta  it is the smallest reparation i can make for the  long years of pain i have caused her  there is no other course for me      but i do not love her  and a woman  they say  always instinctively  feels it when a man s heart is not hers  nonsense  that is only a  cowardly excuse  at least ninitta would never be troubled  she has not  known so much love that she can draw very sharp comparisons  no  she  will be satisfied  and i  well  if a man is such a devilish fool as i  have been  it remains for him to pay the penalty  oh  if youth only  knew      he sighed deeply and began to walk up and down the studio  in which the  dusk was gathering thickly  a last faint gleam from a window high in  the riverward wall fell upon one of the mutilated goddesses in the  gallery  herman looked up  contemplating the phantom like head  gloomily  something in its pose  or perhaps more truly something in his  own mind  suggested a faint likeness to helen  as if it were her ghost  looking down from some far height upon the conflict of his soul      ah   he cried hotly to himself   and she  how can i give up the hope  of winning her  what was a boy s foolish fancy to the passion of a  man  and for such a woman  she is half goddess  no  no  i cannot do it   i cannot marry this italian peasant  this model that has who knows what  history  i will not  i owe something to myself  to my art  what is the  simple happiness of ninitta to my art  i should be a fool to ignore how  much more to the world my own well being is worth than is hers  and  what could i not do with the inspiration of the other  oh  my god      the darkness grew  the phantom faded imperceptibly away  he was left  alone in the darkness to fight out his battle  he marched with great  strides  avoiding obstacles by a certain sixth sense born of constant  familiarity with the place  he fought manfully  persuading himself that  his scruples were as idle as air  remnants of the long since outgrown  superstitions of his childhood  he defiantly claimed the right to be  true to his powers  to his genius  rather than to an empirical standard  erected by narrow moralists  he should be thankful that he had escaped  entangling his life by that absurd marriage in rome seven years ago   and that he was now free to win a wife worthy of himself and of his  art     yet he cut through all the meshes of logic he had himself been weaving   by striking his strong hands together there in the dark  and crying  aloud  his voice startling him in the stillness      my god  what a poltroon i have become  shall i cast on others the  burden of my own mistakes      and seizing hat and cloak he left the studio  taking his way towards  the narrow street where ninitta lodged  hastening to ask her to marry  him before his resolution faltered           xvii     this  would  changes           hamlet  iv           herman found ninitta alone in the attic which served her for a home in  this bleak northern city  so far and so different from her own sunny  capri     bare and half furnished as was the room  the girl had contrived to  impart to it a certain air which removed it from the common place  a  bit of flimsy drapery  begged from some studio  hung over one of the  windows  a rude print of the madonna was pinned to the wall  and under  it  on the wooden table  was a bunch of withered flowers  they were  roses which helen had given ninitta  and the italian  returning home  that day  had in her jealous rage thrown them to the floor and trampled  upon them  then remembering that they had been offered to the madonna   she had been seized with a superstitious fear  and carefully restoring  the battered flowers  had eagerly vowed a fresh bunch to the holy  mother if she might be forgiven this sacrilege     but the most beautiful article in the room was a cast of a woman s  shoulder  it had been modeled by herman in the earliest days of his  acquaintance with ninitta  when she had been still only his model and  not his betrothed  he was touched as he looked at it now  yellow with  time and soiled by its various journeyings  it still preserved unmarred  its lovely shape  exquisite curve melting into exquisite curve as  softly and sweetly as in those glowing days when he had molded it under  the sky of italy     he looked from the cast to ninitta  he had only seen her at the studio   and he experienced a faint feeling of surprise at detecting a subtle  difference in her here at home  it was nothing so tangible that he  could have told by what means he received the impression  yet it was  sufficiently definite to make him lose something of the freedom with  which he had always addressed her  she was no longer simply the model   she was an italian woman in her own home     the years during which they had been separated had formed and  strengthened ninitta s character  if herman had not before noted the  alteration  it was due in part to his pre occupation and in part to the  force of old habit which made her manner toward him much the same as  formerly  to night he began to appreciate the change in her  and he  felt the awkwardness which always results from the discovery that we  must adapt ourselves to a modified condition in a friend     on her side ninitta was naturally surprised at seeing the sculptor  she  had come to regard as hopeless all speculations upon his intentions   and she had waited patiently until he should choose to show her favor   tacitly acknowledging his right to do whatever should be his good  pleasure  had he come at any time and said   ninitta  i am here to  marry you   she would gladly but quietly have made ready to follow  where he chose to lead  even to the world s end  equally  had he said    ninitta  i have come to say good by  you will never see me again   she  would have acquiesced without a murmur  and then  perhaps  have taken  her own life  as long as it was his simple wish  uninfluenced by the  will of another  she would never have questioned     now  however  all passive acquiescence was at an end  since the scene  in helen s studio  ninitta had an object upon which to expend all her  energies  and she even almost forgot to love herman in the intensity of  her sudden jealous hatred of mrs  greyson  yesterday grant herman would  have found a woman not unlike the ninitta of old times  tender  loving   pathetically submissive  today he was confronted by a fury  only  restrained by the respect for his presence born of long habit      good evening   he said gently  as he entered  his mood softened by the  struggle through which he had passed in his studio      good evening   she answered defiantly  in italian   so you are not  with her       what   he exclaimed     he had been wholly unprepared for this outburst  and for the instant  was too surprised to at all understand it     a sudden rage seemed to seize ninitta  which swept away all barriers of  restraint       si    si    si    she cried   i am not blind  what if  you are my betrothed  when this woman comes to entrap you  to bewitch  you with an evil eye  to steal your soul  yes  yes  you are not with  her to night as you were last night  did i not see you myself come out  of her house       stop   he said in his most commanding tone  but without anger     the calmness and decision of the manner arrested her  she sank back  into a chair  regarding him with defiant eyes      so you have followed me   continued herman  speaking with painful  slowness  so that every word seemed to poor ninitta to fall upon her  like a curse   so you have played the spy upon me  ah      as he looked at her she began to cower  she shrank back in her seat   putting up her hands to shield her face from his gaze      yet i meant to marry you   he said  half to himself  although still  addressing her   i came to night to say   come  ninitta  let us take up  the broken romance that a cruel mistake interrupted there in rome   i  had long ago outgrown my old fancy  but i meant to be true to my  promise to you  i meant to give up even my ambition for your sake  to  make your life happy and secure  and this is your trust in me  if you  really loved me  to track me like a thief would have been impossible to  you  and where have you learned this trick of playing the spy   he went  on with growing wrath  becoming more and more cruel with every word    it is a relic of your paris life  i fancy  it is hardly a resource to  which a good girl would be driven  i at least believed you when you  told me you had been true to me      he spoke rapidly  aggressively  the fact that he was outraging his own  instincts in beating with bitter words the girl who bowed before him  with drooping head and disheveled hair made him but the more harsh  to  fall from the height of self sacrifice into a pool of vulgar intrigue   bah  his disgust at himself for ever having known this woman seemed too  great to be borne     yet under all his passionate protest and repulsion he was conscious  that he doubted what he was himself saying with so much vehemence  that  he secretly believed ninitta to be true and pure  and that to her  italian blood  to her peasant nurture  was due the espionage in which  she had been self betrayed  the sting of conscience  too  in the  knowledge that the model s jealousy of helen was well founded  the  humiliation of finding his feelings and motives discovered  increased  his irritation  he felt a base desire to stab and humiliate ninitta   but for whom he might be free to win the one woman he had ever loved   and the more his denunciations recoiled to hurt himself  the more  eagerly he poured them out  as in some moods of mental anguish one  finds relief in the pain of self inflicted physical hurts      yes   he said  more and more completely abandoning control of himself    yes  this tells sufficiently what you have learned in paris       oh  no  no  no   she cried  flinging herself at his feet and groveling  there   no  no  for the love of the virgin  signor  not that  i have  been good  oh  for the love of god  signor  for the love of god      she was shaken by the storm of sobs in which her words ended  she got  hold of his feet and refused to rise when he attempted to lift her  her  long hair  escaped from its stilletto  fell about her face  even in  this agitated moment the sculptor in grant herman noted with a sharp   aesthetic pleasure the beautiful curves of her neck and shoulders      pity   she went on between her agonized sobs   oh  forgive me  i will  do any thing you wish  i will go away and leave you      he stooped and raised her by main force  yet tenderly      there  there  ninitta   he said   i was wrong  i do believe you are a  good girl  but you should not have played the spy      he soothed her as well as he was able  her violence spending itself in  passionate tears  she drew herself away from him  and sat down again in  the chair she had been occupying  she put up her hands to her head   twisting the loose tresses into a great coil  the sleeve of her dress   unfastened in her agitation  fell back from her rounded arm  the superb  lines of her figure were displayed by her attitude  her face  flushed  with weeping and lighted by the still tear wet eyes  if not beautiful   was appealing and pitiful  some fiber touched of old vibrated anew in  his being  he made a step forward      ninitta   he said   i came to night to ask you to marry me at once  to  fulfill the promise i made you so long ago      the words and the tone both were tender  but he had said those same  words in anger just before      but you do not love me   she responded  her arms dropping pathetically  into her lap   you have said it       but i was angry   answered herman  for the moment almost believing  that his old love was re awakened   i did not mean you to believe it       if you do love me   she said  a new look coming into her eyes   you  will promise me never to see her again      he started back as if from a blow  his frail dream of passion was  shattered like a bubble at her words  a wave of bitter self contempt  that its existence had been possible swept over him  the blood surged  into his cheeks  ninitta saw the flush and her eye kindled      promise me   she repeated   it is little for love to ask  it is my  right      with instinctive feminine guile she leaned towards him in an attitude  so beautiful  so appealing that even now he was moved  but with this  emotion came  too  a subtle if now fainter sense of degradation that he  was susceptible to this dangerous fascination  with a painful  consciousness of how wide a moral gulf had opened between them by the  anger and vulgar jealousy which ninitta displayed  it is not  impossible  too  that his instinctive clinging to helen was a stronger  power than he knew  while still through all his mingled emotions ran  the resolve he had made to give himself up to his old betrothed      no   he said  yet as he moved slowly towards the door he had the air  of a man who still deliberates     she threw herself back in her seat with a touching gesture of despair   but also with a gleam of malice in her eyes  which he  turning with his  hand upon the latch  caught and understood      no   he repeated with final decision   no  no            xviii     bedecking ornaments of praise       love s labor s lost  ii   i       fenton had returned to boston with his bride  but as yet helen had not  seen him  one morning late in march  however  he came to call      i could not come before   he said after the first greeting    i have  married a wife   and the amount of arrangement and adjustment implied  in that statement is simply astounding       i am glad to see you at last   she returned   and your wife  is she  well       my wife   replied he  with a little hesitancy over the unfamiliar  term   is well  cannot you come to see us before that dreadful  reception through which i am to be dragged  i d like you to know edith  in a different way from the crowd      helen crossed the room and sat down in her favorite chair by the  window      he ought to understand   was her thought   why cannot he see that it  is impossible for his wife and me to harmonize  we have no common  ground       i shall be glad to   she said aloud  inwardly shrinking at the need of  speaking disingenuously to one with whom she had so long been upon  terms of frankness   i will come very soon  to day or to morrow   to day  though  i must go and see my bas relief  it is all ready to be  cut for the furnace  i only want to take a last look at it  to be sure  that every thing is right  if it will not bore you   she added  a  little hesitatingly   you might come too  it is your last chance to  find fault to any advantage  for any changes must be made at once       i d like to go   answered her friend  looking at his watch   if i can  get back to luncheon  yes  there s plenty of time       benedick  the married man   laughed helen   that i should ever live to  see this air of domesticity      they crossed the common  chatting idly  and both conscious that the  frankness of their old intercourse was somehow lacking  that it was  necessary to begin a new adjustment upon a basis different from the  former one  they talked upon indifferent subjects  of what had occurred  during the three weeks of arthur s absence  playing the part of  amiability without pleasure  endeavoring to simulate the old relations  which no longer had real existence      oh  arthur   helen laughed  suddenly   let s not go on in this way   let us quarrel  or something  say a wicked epigram  do any thing   only don t be so eminently amiable       my head is as empty of ideas   he returned laughing  in his turn   as  is a modern title page of punctuation points  besides  edith has  forbidden wicked epigrams       does she therefore suppose she can suppress them       oh  i don t know   responded fenton  good humoredly   i am not in as  epigrammatic a frame of mind as i was        tis a good sign       yes  a sign i am growing inane and respectable       i can imagine you one about as easily as the other       that is bitter sweet  a compliment and a flout       if i had said that   helen observed  smiling   you would have  retorted  with a look of gloomy solemnity  that most things in life are  bitter sweet  unless  indeed  you felt called upon to phrase it that it  had the advantage of most earthly matters by not being wholly bitter       was i ever guilty of such commonplace attempts at epigrams as that    returned arthur   if so it is certainly a good thing that i have given  up repartee for matrimony       oh  that is brilliant beside many of your attempts  i assure you  and  as for your giving them up  i reserve my decision       you shall see  skeptic   he said lightly   i expect to change the face  of the whole world if necessary       it is a common error of ardent temperaments   she returned pleasantly   but with evident sincerity   to assume that a state of feeling can  change the world       but i must  i will   he began eagerly  then the light died out of his  face and he ended with a shrug     helen put up her hand with an impulsive gesture  as if about to speak     then letting her arms fall by her side  she turned to unlock the studio  door  which by this time they had reached     the bas relief was still shrouded in its damp envelopes  which helen  carefully removed  keeping fenton away  that he might first see the  work as a whole  and not lose its legitimate effect by catching  fragmentary glimpses as it was uncovered  when at last it was fully  disclosed  she called him to her as she stood before it      by jove  that s stunning   he exclaimed  after an instant s pause   which gave him time to see it fairly   helen  you have outdone  yourself  that figure is simply superb  i hadn t an idea you would come  out so well  i m wonderfully proud of you       you are more amiable than ever   she responded  but her flushed cheek  showed that she was touched by his earnest praise   for that figure i  have to thank ninitta s posing  she is an inspiration       but ninitta did not inspire that splendid head   observed arthur   pointing with his cane at the december   and you evidently did that   con amore   by jove  it s grant herman  as i live      as he spoke he turned and saw ninitta on the threshold      shall you want me to day   the latter asked of helen      what made that girl look so savage   fenton questioned as the door  closed behind the model      she perhaps chooses to be jealous of me   helen replied composedly       elle a peutetre raison        perhaps       you say that too calmly by half   was his gay response   yet as every  work a woman does has a man for its end  i learned that from the  classics  penelope  you know  and even washwoman nausicaae  i suppose it  is fair to assume this had  only who is the man      helen flushed slightly  she recalled the ambition with which she had  begun this work  to make the man beside her praise its completion  and  she was conscious that before she finished it was the praise of herman  for which she strove      it is filthy lucre that inspires me   she replied steadily   i need no  other incentive      they walked about the studio  talking of the bas relief as seen from  different points  of how it was to be cut for firing  and on the safe  ground of art they forgot all personal constraints  until the striking  of a clock aroused fenton to a sense of the flight of time      i must go   he said   i am no end glad i came  the truth is i am not  very well acquainted with this married man  and it is comfortable to  slip back occasionally into a familiar bachelor mood  however   he  continued with his brightest smile   i like the benedick far better  than i should ever have dreamed possible  and his wife is charming  and  i want to say  too   he added   that i have a thousand times thanked  you for taking that vial before i went to be married  i m in a spasm of  virtuousness just now  and it is pleasant to remember that i did not  have it that day      they went down stairs and out into the soft  spring like day   sauntering homeward in a happy and accordant mood  arthur urged helen s  going home to lunch with himself and edith  but to helen the morning  was far too precious to be ended in a possibly inharmonious meeting  with mrs  fenton     and that afternoon herman sent for mrs  greyson in all haste  ninitta  had vented her jealous rage upon the bas relief  destroying the head of  december which she heard fenton say must have been done  con  amore   and the beautiful may for which she herself had posed           xix     now he is for the numbers      romeo and juliet  ii           mrs  fenton s wedding reception was largely attended  however strongly  the artist might savor of bohemianism  his wife was connected with  certain prominent philistines  and he had exhibited a most remarkable  readiness to have them present in force      into the camp of philistia itself   muttered rangely to bently  as  they elbowed their way through the crowd   by the great horn spoon  if  there isn t peter calvin  arthur calls him the great boston art greek   that ever i should live to see the humbug under fenton s roof tree       pshaw   returned bently with an oath   what a set of rubbishy old fobs  and dowagers there is here anyway  is this the kind of people fenton  means to know       means to know   echoed rangely   he s got to go down on his marrow  bones to get them to consent to know him  they patronize art  and that  means that they snub artists       humph   exclaimed bently   is he sycophant enough to do that       that s as you look at it  his wife probably decides the matter for  him  she very naturally likes to know what she would call  nice  people   how those women chatter  i wonder what they find to talk  about       not necessarily any thing  they always talk all the same whether  they ve any thing to say or not       how much of life is wasted in enduring people for whom one does not  care   philosophized rangely  looking over the throng which filled to  overflowing the fentons  somewhat limited rooms   ah  there is dr   ashton  how do you do  doctor       as well as could be expected   the doctor answered   in this  antiquated assembly       oh  boston is only an antiquarian society   laughed rangely   and  these old tabbies are all honorary members  by jove  though  there are  some awfully pretty girls here       i ve observed that boston girls are apt to be pretty when they give  their minds to it   remarked bently   not when they wander round with  homer under one arm and virgil under the other and dyspepsia in the  stomach  but when they are deliberately frivolous      the throng separated them at this moment  and dr  ashton went in search  of host and hostess  arthur caught sight of his tall figure  and made a  sign at once of recognition and summons  struggling between a young  episcopal clergyman and a corpulent old lady  dr  ashton made his way  with difficulty to the spot where his friend was standing      you are the most married man i know  arthur   was his greeting    brigham young wasn t a circumstance  i have been half an hour crossing  the room       dr  ashton  edith  my wife  will   was the only reply fenton made   unless one could interpret the quizzical glance he bestowed upon his  friend      i feel already acquainted with you   was mrs  fenton s remark   i have  heard of you so often  my husband has spoken to me so much of his  friends that it is hard for me to realize that i do not know them  myself       you have been very little in boston  i believe   dr  ashton said   looking at her in a sudden surprise at remembering that he had seen her  face before      very little   replied she   i have been abroad a great part of my life  and       new claims upon her attention ended the conversation with that charming  abruptness characteristic of such an occasion  and the doctor was left  to elbow his way out of the crush  with the sense of having done all  that would be required of him  he found a corner where he could watch  the hostess and fell to wondering whether mrs  fenton in her turn  remembered their previous meeting     edith fenton was a slender  nun like woman  too pale  with a smile of  wonderful attractiveness   a woman to wear lilies   was the way grant  herman put it afterward  a remark which conveyed well the purity of her  face  her ease of manner showed familiarity with the conventionalities  of life  yet in some vague way she seemed removed from the people by  whom she was to day surrounded      she has been brought up in the old narrow ways   dr  ashton reflected    but there are great possibilities about her  she ll either be the  making of fenton or send him to the dogs  she will scarcely find much  room in her house for many of his former friends  i fancy      he stood watching the people and amusing himself with cynical  speculations until he saw grant herman s great figure among the guests   he knew him but slightly and looked at him with an indifference which a  couple of hours later he regretted  herman cared little for the  formalities of the occasion  and very likely might have gone away  without even being presented to the hostess had not fred rangely taken  him in charge and brought him safely through that ceremony  now the  sculptor was looking for mrs  greyson  of whom he soon caught sight   when he began making his way towards her  she however perceived him   and with the feeling that she could not bear to meet him in public just  at this time  she evaded him by slipping into the window where her  husband was ensconced      take me out of this  please   she said   i am tired      he gave her his arm without speaking  and together they made their way  from the room      i want to talk to you   he remarked easily   mayn t i walk home with  you      when she was ready they went together out into the starlit streets   neither spoke at first  each carrying on a train of thought to which  the other could have no adequate clew      who is arthur s wife   dr  ashton asked at length   i know she was a  miss caldwell  that she came from providence  and that she has been an  orphan so short a time that they had a perfectly quiet wedding  but  that is the extent of my knowledge  is she an artist       an amateur   answered helen   she studied in paris  he met her there   she is a relative  i forget just how far or near  of peter calvin  she  seems to me an icicle  think of arthur s marrying a  religieuse        what is his game  i wonder   said her companion thoughtfully   do you  know when she was in paris  was it when we were there       let me see   helen responded  with a mental calculation   yes  she  must have been there the last year we were  why  did you ever meet  her       perhaps   was the careless reply     they reached helen s door as he spoke      come in   she said   fortunately i can make you a salad  it is a long  time since we had a  petit souper  together  i have  too   something to say to you      he followed her to the pretty parlor  and sat idly chatting while she  made her preparations for the supper           xx     the world is still deceived     merchant of venice  iii           it was a dainty little table to which helen invited her husband when  every thing was ready  the china was of odd bits picked up here and  there abroad  and it was now disposed with an artist s eye for color  and grouping  a tall bottle of rhine wine had come from some mysterious  nook  and beside it were a pair of fine old german glasses  frail as  bubbles      i have always to offer my guests rhine wine   helen said   for i ve no  glasses for any thing else  arthur is ungracious enough to object  he  does not like white wine as you do       i do like it   her guest answered  drawing the cork   and so does  arthur  only he does not know it  he has somewhere stumbled upon the  whim of pretending not to  and he can deceive himself more completely  than any other man i ever saw  rhine wine is the most poetic of  beverages  it should go down like oil and only leave a fragrance like a  poet s dream behind it       that is quite a rhapsody for you  will  only your cool tone gives it a  certain cynical flavor       i mean all i say  i assure you  champagne is vulgar  it is the drink  of self made snobs and cads who wish to pass for men of the world  but  rhine wine is the drink for poets and artists       i am delighted to hear you defend it  it is very good of you  when i  happen to know you are not fond of it  it is a graceful return for my  inhospitality in not giving you your favorite burgundy  but i haven t a  drop       oh  don t mind the wine  i came to see you   dr  ashton said  with his  delightful smile   how droll it was to see arthur to day  do you think  he has really persuaded himself he is in love with his wife       arthur has great adaptability   helen returned   i think he believes  he is in love  i m sure i hope you ll not feel it your duty to tell him  he isn t       i m not mephistopheles   answered dr  ashton  smiling  and watching  appreciatively as she made the salad     mrs  greyson had dressed carefully for the reception from which she had  just come  and her cream colored cashmere  with soft old thread lace   and a bunch of amber hued roses at the throat  became her as only a  dress chosen by an artist could  it fell away from her exquisite arms   and from among the lace rose her beautiful neck  the stuff of her gown  setting off the lovely texture of her skin to perfection      i must not ruin my best attire   she said lightly  gathering it up    now ninitta has spoiled my bas relief  it may be long before i get  more  i owe you a good deal  will  for letting me study modeling in  paris       it was pure selfishness   he returned good humoredly   i wanted to  keep you busy so that i might go my own way  but what about your  bas relief  who spoiled it  who is ninitta  and what has she against  you       that is what i wanted to tell you      she did not speak again for a moment  seemingly intent upon the exact  measurement of the ingredients of her salad  in reality she was  considering how best to present what she had to say  she mentally ran  over the points she wished to make  becoming thereby conscious that she  had herself come to no definite conclusions upon the topic she was  about to discuss  she looked furtively at her husband  noting his  attitude  his expression  and whatever her past experience enabled her  to construe into indications of his mood  as well and as long as she  had known this man  she was still ignorant of the key to his nature  that  feeling or motive which  touched in an ultimate appeal  would  always insure a response  conscience is the fruit of the tree of  experience  and  taken in this sense  every man must be possessed of a  conscience  which by its inner voice re enforces any pleading which  coincides with its dictates  what was the nature of her husband s  inward monitor helen had never been able to discover and at this moment  she realized keenly her ignorance      will   she said earnestly  laying down her salad fork and spoon   i  think it is wrong for us to live as we do      he shrugged his shoulders  looking at her curiously      i cannot flatter myself that you care to return to the old  uncomfortableness      she flushed warmly  with a keen pang of mingled pain and indignation      no   she replied   no  never that  it is not for ourselves  but for  others       others  fenton      she flushed more deeply still      i have told you already that you are mistaken about my regard for  arthur  it was not he i meant      she served her guest  and sat playing nervously with her fork as he ate  and praised the salad      mr  herman sent for me the other afternoon   she began again  forcing  herself to speak calmly   my model ninitta is very fond of him  and  chose to be jealous of his praise of my work  it might have all gone  over without an outburst  i suppose  if she had not had her attention  called to the fact that i had modeled his head for december  why she  had never happened to notice it i don t know  she was in the studio  constantly       not when he was there   queried dr  ashton  holding up his graceful   antique wine glass and admiring it      no  not when he was there   repeated his wife   she had pounded off  the head when he sent for me with a mallet she had picked up in his  studio  i never saw him in such a rage  she was gone when i got there   she didn t make any attempt to conceal it  she came stalking  melodramatically into his studio with the mallet and laid it down    there   said she   now kill me  i have broken her work   it was like a  fashion magazine story  he thought at first she had gone mad       so she had  women are always insane when they are jealous  i wish i  had arthur s knack at epigram  and i d make that sound original       he says he was very harsh   helen continued   though i fancy he could  not be quite that in any circumstances  it was very hard   she added  with a sigh   it was like looking at a dead child to see my best work  ruined  it was really a part of myself       but can t it be repaired  it was in the clay  wasn t it       yes  but i fear for my exhausted enthusiasm  i can never do it as it  was before  my poor  unlucky december      she toyed with her glass absently  apparently for the moment forgetting  her companion  who continued his supper with no less relish than  before  he watched her keenly  however  fully aware that there was more  to be told  he was a man too accustomed to follow any desire or indulge  any whim not to notice appreciatively  as he had noticed many times  before  how beautiful were the curves of his wife s arms and throat   and with what grace her head was poised  he had once defined a liberal  man as one who could appreciate his own wife  and he would have been  far more insensible than he was  if  with this beautiful woman before  him he had not been  judged by his own standard  extremely liberal      and this has what to do with the question of our relations being  known   he asked     she started from her reverie  the red again showing faintly in her  cheek      it is hardly fair   she answered in a tone softer and lower than that  in which she had been speaking   to tell you all that mr  herman said   he wishes to marry me       and you wish you were free to have it so      there was once more a pause  helen busied herself in an elaborate  arrangement of the torn lettuce leaves upon her plate  seemingly  concentrating all her thoughts upon forming them into an intricate  figure      will   she said  suddenly  lifting her eyes and leaning towards him    i do not know how to make you understand  i haven t succeeded so well  in my attempts thus far in life as to be very sanguine of doing it now   you do not know how ashamed and contemptible i felt for being party to  the deception that made it possible for him to speak so to me  he was  so honest  so earnest  he was so unconscious of the barriers between  us  i felt that i had done him such an irreparable wrong by concealing  the truth  he had a right to know that i am a married woman       did you tell him       no  but i must  i want to be free from the promise we made to each  other       it all comes   returned her husband without any show of irritation    from my telling fenton       i cannot see what that has to do with it  i like the absence from  questioning  the avoidance of gossip  as much as you can  but it makes  me feel as if i were a living lie to have mr  herman bringing his  honest love to me to be met only by deception  it is cruel and it is  wrong       that depends entirely upon how you define wrong   retorted dr  ashton  coolly   i do not see why it is wrong for me to decline to sacrifice my  convenience to mr  herman s sentiment  but without going into the  question of metaphysics  let us look at the matter reasonably  do you  love mr  herman      notwithstanding the studied nonchalance of his tone  a glance into his  eyes might have shown helen how much importance he attached to her  answer  a woman is peculiarly dangerous when she is telling one man  that another loves her  the masculine greed of possession is aroused by  the mere thought of a possible rival  and dr  ashton was conscious at  this moment of a kindling desire himself to win helen s love  which he  knew perfectly well had never been his      that is not at all relevant   was her reply  her eyes downcast   the  question of honesty is enough now  at least i respect mr  herman  and i  must treat him squarely  as you would say  you have always told me to  be  a square fellow   you know   she added  raising her glance with a  faint smile      but if you tell him   said her husband  with a subtle tinge of  impatience in his tone   others must know  you can t go on letting one  after another into the secret without its soon becoming public  property       why not then   she responded   i wonder we have been able to keep it  so long  it is sure to be known now you have come home  i do not mean  to proclaim it upon the housetops  but to let it work out if it will   what harm can it do       it will harm me  my life is not so secluded as yours is  helen  it  will make things confoundedly awkward  i shall have to go about giving  endless explanations  besides  here is arthur s wife  i particularly  don t want her to know       why not  it is precisely that i was coming to  she seems to feel far  more kindly to me than i should have supposed possible  i can t lie to  her  will  she has already asked me questions about my past life hard  to answer  i want to tell her  so that we may have an honest basis for  our friendship  i don t want to lose my hold on her       nor on arthur   acquiesced he gravely   it is for that reason that i  say you had better not tell her  i usually know what i am saying  do i  not  i tell you it is for your own sake that i warn you to be quiet   arthur isn t going to be held in the leash very long by that piece of  china ware piety  and it is to you he will naturally turn for sympathy   don t spoil your chance of his friendship by breaking with her yet       will   his wife said  with a glitter in her eyes he knew of old    sometimes you talk like a very fiend incarnate       that   he replied rising   is precisely what i am  there are a few  rare  but fairly well authenticated cases on record  helen  where a man  under stress of circumstances  has been able to keep his own counsel   women without a confidant go mad  for your own sake you d better trust  me  now that arthur isn t available  so i ll come and see you again  i  am obliged to you for this jolly little supper  your salads always were  perfection  i d like to stay and have you make me some coffee  but i  have an engagement at twelve  good night          xxi     his pure heart s truth     two gentlemen of verona  iv           when grant herman attempted to speak with mrs  greyson at the fenton s  reception  he had more in view than simply the desire of being near the  woman he loved  he was full of trouble and bewilderment  and  instinctively turned toward her for aid and sympathy     the scene between himself and helen  to which the latter had alluded in  her conversation with dr  ashton  was of far deeper import than her  words might have seemed to imply  in the first shock of discovering  that her work was broken she had been so overcome  that although she  struggled bravely to conceal her feelings  she had excited the  sculptor s keenest pity  and it not unnaturally followed that in  attempting to express his sympathy he found himself telling his love  before he was aware  he had determined to be silent upon this subject   uncertain what were helen s feelings towards him and restrained by a  sense of loyalty to the bond which united him to ninitta  he had  resolved to bury his love in his own breast  at least until time gave  him opportunity of honorably declaring it  now circumstances betrayed  him into an avowal of his passion  and he was not without the indignant  feeling that ninitta s act had freed him from all obligations to her   it might have required an ingenious casuist to arrive logically at the  conclusion that an injury which the italian had done to another  released him from his plighted word  but the person injured was the  woman he loved  and he blindly felt that ninitta had struck at himself  through his most sensitive feelings  he renounced all the fealty to  which he had been held by a sense of honor  and he now poured out to  helen the full tide of his passionate love     the sculptor was not a man to be lightly moved  but it is these calm   grave natures that once aroused are most irresistible  his passionate  outburst took helen unaware  she scarcely knew what she did  and she  became suddenly aware of a truth so overwhelming that every thing else  faded into insignificance beside it      i love you   he cried out  and at the word she first knew  with a  poignant pang of mingled bliss and anguish  that she too loved him     it seemed to her that some power above her own volition ruled her  as  in moments of high excitement the body sometimes appears to declare its  independence of the will  and to act wholly by its own decisions  she  was aware that she raised her eyes to his  although she would have  given much to avoid his glance  and she knew that it was from what he  read there that he took courage to fold her in his embrace     yet with his arms about her and his piercing kisses upon her face   helen felt as if sinking helplessly into a mighty ocean  as if all  struggles must be unavailing  and she could only yield to the  resistless love which engulfed her     from this first feeling of powerlessness  however  her strong nature  sprang with a sharp recoil  she was too noble to surrender without a  struggle  she would not even think whether she loved this man  that  might be considered upon some safe vantage ground  now all energy must  be concentrated upon escaping from the deadly peril in which she found  herself     helen had freed herself as far as she was able from the marriage bond  which had so galled her  and she was glad to forget that such a tie had  ever existed  but she yet remembered that she was still a wife  and the  kiss of a man not her husband overwhelmed her with shuddering  humiliation and fear  she struggled from her lover s embrace with such  an expression of terror upon her face  that he started back amazed and  grieved     he began to stammer confused words of contrition  of sorrow  of love   and of supplication      how could you   she gasped   oh  leave me      there came into her excited mind a way of escape  upon which  even  though it brought with it a sense of baseness  she seized in despair      ninitta   she said   ninitta      he gave her a look of pain which went to her very heart  he did not  move or answer  but his whole soul seemed to look through his dark eyes  in pitiful appeal      go   she continued  but in a hurried voice which betrayed her  agitation   leave me now  oh  i cannot bear it      and crushed with pain and shame  she buried her face in her hands and  burst into tears     herman made a step towards her  but instantly she recovered herself   looking up with swimming eyes and lips that quivered despite her utmost  effort      no   she said   do not touch me  you must go  i cannot bear another  word  forgive me   she went on rapidly  as he hesitated  still with  those appealing eyes fixed upon her   oh  forgive me  but go      he turned slowly and moved towards the door  the broken bas relief   with its beautiful mutilated figure caught his eye  and seemed again to  remind him that he had at last a right to speak to helen  unhampered by  the thought of ninitta  he looked back as if he would even now disobey  her and plead his love anew  but her eyes refused his prayer before it  could be uttered  he lingered still an instant      i cannot go   he broke out suddenly   i love you  i must stay  i must  at least have an answer  do you think a man could kiss you once and  then leave you like this      she shivered as if she felt anew his passionate embrace and shrank from  it  she threw her glance about as to discover some means of escape  the  gesture  the look  overwhelmed him with sudden remorse  he trusted  himself not for a single backward look now  but rushed out of the  studio  leaving her sitting there like the princess of the fairy tale  who overcame the genii only by recourse to immortal fire which consumed  her also     alone in his studio the sculptor strode up and down  struggling with  the emotion which mastered him  he debated with himself whether helen  loved him or not  yet the more carefully he recalled his interview with  her  the more impossible he found it to determine  but hope plucked  courage out of this very uncertainty  and clung to the belief that had  not helen in her heart some affection for him  she could not have been  so touched     but what of ninitta  he threw back his head and walked down the studio   his steps sounding sharply upon the hard cement floor  what of ninitta   he had absurdly dallied with his supposed obligations to her long  enough  now  at least  after this outrage  he repeated to himself  he  was free  he was at liberty now  if indeed he had not always been  to  consider what he owed to himself  what to the woman he loved     he recalled the hot words he had spoken to the model earlier in the  afternoon when the anger of discovery was fresh upon him  and he felt a  pang of self reproach  he could not but know how poignant to ninitta  must be the grief of giving him up  although he assured himself that in  the long years of separation she must have become accustomed to live  without him  and that her grief would be rather fancied than real  yet  he was too tender hearted to be wholly at ease after all his reasoning   he at last started out to find ninitta  perhaps to comfort her  perhaps  to cast her off forever  at least to come to some definite conclusion  of their doubtful relations     but ninitta was not to be found  she was not in her attic  nor did she  return that night  nor the next day  nor yet the following  and it was  to tell of the model s disappearance  and to ask aid in tracing her   that herman had wished to speak to helen at the fenton s reception           xxii     upon a church bench     much ado about nothing  iii           herman did not see helen for several days after the reception  but she  came down to the studio sunday afternoon to begin the repairing of her  mutilated bas relief  the sculptor heard her step pass his door  and  felt a thrill at the sound for which he had longingly waited every  waking hour since he had heard helen go out upon the night of ninitta s  disappearance     he waited what seemed to him a long time  forcing himself to perform  certain trifling things needful in the studio  yet mrs  greyson had  only been able to get fairly to work before she heard his footstep  and  then his tap upon her door     he entered the studio almost hesitatingly  and after the usual  greetings stood looking gravely at the disfigured clay      i began to think you were never coming to restore it   he remarked   breaking at last the silence      i could not bear to touch it   she returned  not caring to confess  that she had also wished to avoid him until time should have restored  his usual self control   but i determined yesterday to begin this  morning  only strangely enough i went to church for the first time  since i came from europe       ah   returned herman smiling   i often go to church when i am not too  busy       i hardly supposed that a pagan was guilty of going to any church where  he could not worship pasht       one can worship whatever deity he pleases in whatever temple  i  suppose   was his rejoinder   i m catholic in my tastes  i do not so  much mind what people worship  if they are only sincere about it       it must be a great comfort to believe every thing  if one only could       there is often danger   he observed   that we assume it to be a  weakness to believe any thing       it is  i m afraid   replied she  turning her face from him and  seemingly intent upon her modeling      at least we believe in work   herman answered   else we are not  artists  you certainly find joy and support in your art       yes   helen said with a sigh   but i fancy the joy of creation  great  as it is  can never be so satisfying to a woman as to a man  it is  humiliating to confess  or it is presumptuous to boast  i am not sure  which  but a woman is never so fully an artist as a man  he is in great  moments all artist  but a woman is never able to lay herself aside even  in her most imaginative moods       i cannot think you wholly right   her master returned smiling   but to  go back a little  at least faith is woman s peculiar province and  prerogative  we seem nowadays to pride ourselves upon being superior to  belief in any thing  but it is really a poor enough hypocrisy  if we  really believed nothing  should we ever give up a single selfish desire  or combat any impulse that seizes us  for my part  i am glad to find  men better than their professions  but this   he added with his genial  smile   is more of a sermon  very likely  than you heard at church       i at least agree with it better than the one i heard at church this  morning  the preacher patronized the deity so that he shocked me       that troubles me at church   herman assented   preachers are so  irreverent      helen stepped back to observe the effects of the work she was doing      do you think   she ventured   that it would be possible for me to  induce ninitta to pose again for the may  if i told her that i am not  angry  that i understand  and that          but ninitta is gone   exclaimed the sculptor  suddenly recalled to  present difficulties   i have not been able to find her since the day  she did this       gone   echoed helen in dismay   and you cannot find her      herman related in detail the steps he had taken to trace ninitta  all  of which had thus far proved unavailing  he had endeavored to avoid  publicity  but he already began to fear that it would be necessary to  call detectives to his aid      not yet   helen said   let me try first  have you seen mr  fenton       no  why  i have been very cautious  i have told nobody but fred  rangely      helen reflected a moment  her woman s instinct told her that it was not  likely ninitta would put any great distance between herself and the  sculptor  the model could have but few acquaintances in the city  and  as she would need support it seemed probable she might try posing for  some of the artists  as this thought crossed her mind  helen remembered  that ninitta had promised to pose for fenton when no longer wanted for  the has relief  it was therefore possible that fenton might know  something of the whereabouts of the missing girl  and in any case helen  had been so used to consulting the artist in any perplexity  that it  was but natural for her thoughts to turn to him now      let me try   she repeated   it will be less likely to excite talk if i  look for her  she was my model  trust the search to me for a day or  two      he was only too glad to do so  glad to be released from the burden of  anxiety  as by virtue of some subtle faith in mrs  greyson he was  glad  of any thing in which he might obey her  glad above all of any bond of  common interest which might draw them nearer to each other  even if it  were search for the woman who stood between them     on her way homeward helen went into studio building  but before she had  climbed half way to fenton s room  she encountered dr  ashton      it is of no use   was his greeting   he isn t in  his wife has  probably taken him to church       he was at church this morning   helen answered  putting her hand into  the one dr  ashton extended   i saw him       did you go to church  what a lark       it was rather a lark   she assented   only i got wretchedly blue  before the service was done       what church was it  mrs  fenton looks as if she d poise dizzily on  high church altitudes like the angel on st  angelo       so she does  she goes to the nativity       how did arthur look       amused at first  then bored  then cross  and finally  when the sermon  was well under way  indignant       and his wife       his wife  will   helen said with a sudden enthusiasm   looked like a  saint  she really believes all these fables  i wish i did       it will be some fun to watch arthur s conversion and backsliding   dr   ashton observed   if he really gets far enough along to be able to  backslide  where are you going       to see arthur  i have an errand       do you object to my walking with you   he asked with a deference rare  enough to attract her notice     the sun was setting  and the trees on the common  as yet showing but  faintest signs of coming buds  stood out against the saffron sky  the  long shadows stretched softly over the dull ground  while every slight  prominence was gilded and transfigured by the golden glow which flooded  from the west  the atmosphere had that peculiar brilliancy  characteristic of the season  while the cool and bracing air was full  of that champagne like exhilaration in which lies at once the  fascination and the fatality of the new england climate     it was some time before either broke the silence      how i wish   at length began helen wistfully      that shows   spoke her husband  as she left the sentence unfinished    that you are still under forty  when you have quadrupled your decades  you ll thank your stars for deliverances and ask for nothing more       when i get to that stage  then   she returned   i ll take poison       is that a hint       life is bad enough now   she continued without heeding the  interruption   but better a bitter savor than none at all       you should devote yourself to cultivating the approval of conscience  as i do  i only do what i think to be right  you know       but think right whatever you do       not quite that   returned the doctor with a laugh   but the approval  of my conscience  or of my reason  which stands in its place  is  necessary to my happiness  so i change my principles whenever my acts  don t accord with them       so do a great many persons   she responded   perhaps most of us  for  that matter  only we are seldom honest enough to own it       by the way   queried her companion  as they approached her  destination   how came mrs  fenton so quickly domesticated at the  church of the nativity       there is a young man there  a deacon or a monk  i never know these  high church terms  they are usually faded out pieces of romanism  that  once wrote an article which enjoyed the honor of being interred in the  princeton review when her uncle was one of its editors      they reached the doorsteps and dr  ashton said good by  then he turned  back      by the by   he said   i walked up with you to make you invite me to  supper again  i enjoyed the last time very much       did you   returned his wife  rather carelessly   come to morrow  no   not until thursday night       very well  i am to dine here then  and i ll come and give you an  account of my visit            xxiii     heart sick with thought     two gentlemen of verona  i   i       the fentons were just going to dinner when helen arrived  and she was  persuaded to dine with them  she was not without some curiosity to  observe her friend in his new relations  and she also found herself  attracted by edith  although the two women had apparently little in  common     the talk at dinner flowed on easily enough  arthur conversing in the  strain which of old helen had been pleased to call  amiable   and which  fretted her by being conventional and not wholly sincere  she liked the  artist best when he spoke without restraint  even though she might not  agree with his extravagances and often detected a trace of  artificiality in his clever epigrams  it seemed to her that the whole  tendency of edith s influence upon her husband was towards restraint   yet she could not be sure whether the ultimate result upon fenton s  character might not be beneficial      it depends upon arthur himself   helen mused   if he is strong enough  to endure the struggle of adapting his honest belief to her honest  belief  he will be the better for it  i hope his love of ease will not  make him evade the difficulty  it never used to occur to me how little  i really know arthur  so that i cannot tell how this will be      when the host was enjoying his after dinner cigar  which by especial  indulgence upon the part of edith he was allowed to smoke in the  parlor  helen disclosed the object of her visit      do you remember   she asked   that model who posed for my may  and was  to come to you next week       ninitta  of course  what of her       that is precisely what i wish to find out   she responded   she has  changed her address  and i thought it possible you might know something  of her whereabouts       i have not seen her since the morning when she came into your studio   doesn t herman know       the truth is   helen said slowly  weighing her words with regard to  their effect upon edith   that she has run away  and we do not know  what has become of her  she went off in a rage  and i am troubled about  her       is she the italian you spoke of  arthur   interrupted mrs  fenton in  her soft voice   what is she like       yes  a black haired  splendidly shaped girl with piercing black eyes       i think i know where she is   edith said quietly      you   the others asked in one breath      you see   mrs  fenton explained  turning towards helen   i have made  rather a plunge into charity work  of course i meant to do something   but i hardly expected to begin quite so soon  but mr  candish is my  rector  and he came for me yesterday to go to an italian family that  cannot speak english well  the children have just been put into our  schools  but they have not advanced very far as yet  their teacher  asked mr  candish to do something for them  they are wretchedly poor  i  wish you could see the place  mrs  greyson  eight people in a room not  so large as this  and such poverty as you could hardly imagine  yet  these people had taken in another  the mother goes about selling fruit   and she happened to speak to this girl that i think is ninitta in her  own language one night  the girl had been wandering about in the cold   not knowing where to go  and i suppose the sound of her own tongue  touched her heart  poor thing  she would not speak a word to me  how  strange that i should chance to find her       thank heaven she is safe   was helen s inward exclamation  aloud she  said   but what is she doing       nothing   edith answered   she seems to have had a little money  so  that she can pay the family something  and she has helped to take care  of the children  they are catholics  naturally  and not in mr   candish s parish  but they do not seem to have much religion of any  kind  and keep clear of the priest for some reason       my wife will know more of the north end in a month   arthur observed  with an effort at good humor which did not wholly conceal from helen a  trace of annoyance   than i should in six years  i wonder she can bear  to go into such dirty places  of course philanthropy is all very well   but i d rather take it after it has been disinfected      the bitterness in his tone jarred upon helen  she felt a pang at his  evident dissatisfaction with his wife s views  his want of harmony with  his new surroundings      arthur must be disciplined   mrs  fenton said  smiling fondly   if he  once learns that the secret of being happy lies in helping others   he ll be unselfish from mere selfishness  if from nothing else       happy   helen exclaimed involuntarily   does one ever expect to be  happy nowadays  happiness went out of fashion with our grandmothers   bonnets       in this world   edith answered  without any trace in her voice of the  reproof which helen half expected   perhaps you are right  the age is  too restless and skeptical for happiness here  but that makes me long  the more for it hereafter       but even in a future life   returned helen   i can hardly expect to be  happy  since i shall still be myself       happiness   was mrs  fenton s reply   is a question of harmony with  surroundings  is it not  and your surroundings in the other life may be  such that you cannot but be happy       no more theology  please   interposed arthur   you forget  edith  that  i have been to church to day  and too much piety at once might impair  my spiritual digestion forever      a perception that the flippancy of his tone shocked his wife  made  helen turn the conversation again to ninitta  arranging to go with mrs   fenton in the morning to find the missing girl     they fell into silence after this  the twilight deepening until only  the glow of the fire lighted the room  edith went to the piano and  played a bit of mozart  wandering off then into the hymn tunes which  she loved and which were familiar in all orthodox homes of the last  generation  plaintive  olmutz  and stately  geneva   aspiring   amsterdam  and resonant  st  martin s   placid  boylston  and grand   hamburg  nuremburg  benevento  turner  and  old hundred   the tunes  of our fathers  the melodies which embody the spirit of the old time  new england sabbath  a day heavy  constrained and narrow  it may be   but  too  a day calm  unworldly and pure     arthur s cigar was finished  and he had fallen into a deep reverie   looking into the coals  he recalled his conversations with helen before  his marriage  he wondered whether his acquiescence in the limitations  of his present condition  his yielding to his wife s social and  religious views  was an advance or a deterioration  these pious tunes  jarred upon his mood  and he was glad when his wife left the  instrument  his bohemian instinct stirred within him  and taunted the  ease loving quality of his nature which put him in subjection to that  which he believed no more now than in the days when he was the most  sharp spoken of the pagans  a wave of disgust and self loathing swept  over him  he turned abruptly in the dusk toward helen      sing to us   he said   edith has never heard you      but helen had been moved by the melodies  which came to her as an echo  from her childhood  she understood the half peremptory accent in  arthur s voice to which she had so often yielded  but to which she  would not now submit      no   she answered   how can you ask me  my barbaric chant would be  wholly out of keeping here  some other time i shall be glad to sing for  mrs  fenton  now i must go home            xxiv     in place and in account nothing                 i  henry iv   v   i       notwithstanding her previous visit  mrs  fenton found it no easy matter  to guide helen to the place where ninitta had taken refuge     the poorer classes of foreigners in any city are led by similarity of  language and occupations to gather into neighborhoods according to  their nationality  and the italians are especially clannish  the  fruit venders and organ grinders form separate colonies  each  distinguished by the peculiarities incident to the calling of its  inhabitants  the crooked courts in the fruit sellers  neighborhood  being chiefly marked to outward observance by the number of two wheeled  hand carts which  out of business hours  are crowded together there     ninitta was found in a room tolerably clean for that portion of the  city  the old fruit woman who was its mistress having retained more of  the tidiness of thrifty peasant ancestors than most of her class  one  room was made to accommodate the mother and seven children  and during  the absence of the former from home the premises were left in charge of  a girl just entering her teens  who  when helen and edith reached the  place  was engaged in preparing the family dinner of maccaroni  the  younger members of the family had just returned from school  and were  noisily clamoring for their share  and all together relating the  incidents of the day     upon a bed in one corner lay the object of their search  her face  flushed  her hair disordered  her eyes wild and vacant  to all  appearances she was in a high fever  and she took no heed of edith  who  approached the bed and spoke to her  at the sound of mrs  greyson s  voice  however  the sick girl gave a cry and raised herself into a  sitting posture      no  no   she exclaimed in italian  excitedly   i will not  i will  not      helen drew off her gloves and sat down upon the dingy bed beside  ninitta  regarding her with pitying eyes      you shall not   she answered  in the girl s own language   you need do  nothing but what you choose      the soft tone seemed to calm ninitta  she allowed helen to arrange the  soiled and crumpled pillows  and yielded when her self constituted  nurse wished her to lie down again  the latter procured a bowl of  water  and with her handkerchief bathed the sick girl s face  soothing  her with womanly touches which waked in edith a new feeling of sympathy  and tenderness  mrs  greyson s white fingers  contrasting strongly with  the italian s clear dark skin  smoothed the tangled hair from the hot  forehead  and all the while her rich  pure voice murmured comforting  words  of little meaning in themselves  perhaps  but sweet with the  sympathy and womanhood which spoke through them     edith meanwhile was not idle  she applied herself to hushing the  boisterous children  and to bringing something like quiet out of the  tumult of the crowded room  she assisted the girl with her maccaroni   gravely listening to the principles which governed its equitable  distribution  with her own hands giving the grimy little children the  share belonging to each  an air of comfort seemed to come over the  frowsy room after edith had quietly set a chair straight here  picked  up something from the floor there  and arranged the ragged shade at the  window  even the little italians  half barbarians as they were  felt  the change  and were more subdued     ninitta  too  was calmed and soothed  and  with helen s cool hand upon  her hot brow  she sank presently into a drowse      mrs  fenton   helen whispered  fanning her sleeping patient   ninitta  cannot remain here  i must take her home with me  i think she had  better run the risk of being moved than to be ill in this crowded  room       but   remonstrated edith  somewhat aghast at this summary procedure    you do not even know what is the matter with her       no   helen returned lightly   but i shall probably discover       not by finding it something contagious  i hope   her friend said   laying her hand upon mrs  greyson s forehead with a slight  caressing  touch      can you get me a hack   helen asked of the girl who kept the house     but the girl had no idea how to obtain one of those vehicles  which she  had been accustomed to see driving about with a certain awe  but  without the hope of ever being able to do more than admire them from a  distance  unless  indeed  she should have the great good fortune of  going to a funeral  when perhaps she might even ride in one  as did  little sally mcmann of the next court  when her mother died  mrs   fenton therefore went herself for the carriage  finding remonstrance in  vain to change her companion s decision     during her absence ninitta awakened  and  while seeming more rational   was less quiet than before  she repulsed her visitor with angry looks  and muttered defiance  knowing perfectly well the cause of the girl s  agitation  helen knew  also  that it was best to go directly to the  root of the matter  and she did so unshrinkingly      you are wrong   she said in ninitta s ear   it is you he loves  you  are to go home with me because he wishes it      at first the sick girl seemed to gather no meaning from these words   but as helen repeated the assurance again and again  in different  phrases and with herman s name  she became passive  as if she at least  caught the spirit if not the actual significance     mrs  fenton had some difficulty in finding a carriage  and by the time  she returned ninitta had yielded herself submissively to helen s  guidance     mrs  greyson saw that her charge was carefully protected against the  cold  a matter which the mildness of the day rendered easy  and   supported by the two ladies  the model was able to walk down stairs to  the carriage     during the drive homeward helen lay back thinking hotly  and flushed  with excitement  ninitta sank into a doze  and mrs  fenton sat looking  at her friend with the air of one who has discovered in an acquaintance  characteristics before wholly unsuspected  she hesitated a little  and  then  mastering her shyness  she bent forward and kissed helen s hand     the other submitted in silence  indeed  the exaltation of her mood  seemed to lift her above her surroundings so that she felt a strange  remoteness from her companion  yet she was conscious of a vague twinge  of annoyance at edith s act  although she could neither have excused  nor defined the feeling  mrs  fenton not infrequently aroused in her a  curious mingling of attraction and repulsion  and it was under the  influence of the latter that she answered brusquely her friend s next  remark      how did you quiet ninitta   edith asked      by telling her lies   returned helen wearily and laconically      what       she is in no condition to be dealt with rationally   continued mrs   greyson  in a tone explanatory  but in no way defensive   so i said  whatever would soothe her      edith sat in silent dismay  apparently the woman before her  by whose  generous self forgetfulness she had been touched  was perfectly  untroubled by the idea of speaking a falsehood  a state of mind so  utterly beyond edith s experience as to be incomprehensible to her  she  could not bring herself to remonstrate  but it pained her that such  philanthropy should be stained by what she considered so wrong     mrs  fenton was perhaps equally mistaken in her opinion of helen s  regard for truth and of her philanthropy  mrs  greyson had a deep  repugnance to falsehood  and arthur fenton had often good humoredly  jeered at what he called her puritanic scrupulousness in this respect   on an occasion such as at present  however  the use of an untruth would  cause her not even a second thought  her reason so strongly supporting  her course as even to overcome her instincts  a fact which a moralist  might deplore but which still remains a fact     her philanthropy  upon the other hand  although seeming to edith so  disinterested  was largely instigated by a desire to aid grant herman   just what she wished or expected him to do  she could not have told   her actions being no more regulated by strict logic than those of most  women  but she felt that it was the office of friendship to see  if  possible  that no harm came to the italian through the jealousy which  both herself and herman knew to be but too well founded  she determined  to take ninitta home and do for her all that was necessary  in order  that the sculptor be spared the remorse which would pursue him if harm  came to his old betrothed  she was not without a secret feeling   moreover  scarcely acknowledged to herself  that she owed some  reparation to the girl whose lover s heart she had won  no matter how  undesignedly     reaching home  she got ninitta to bed and sent for dr  ashton  then she  dispatched a note to grant herman  saying      ninitta is with me  give yourself no uneasiness            xxv     this deed unshapes me     measure for measure  iv           ninitta s illness proved after all very slight  so slight  indeed  that  dr  ashton  calling in on his way to dine with the fentons thursday  evening  found her gone  she had insisted upon returning to her attic   although helen had not allowed her to depart without promising not to  abscond a second time     ninitta was grateful to mrs  greyson with all the ardor of her  passionate southern heart  she did not  it is true  understand the  relations between herman and helen  but even her jealousy was lost in  the gratitude she felt for the beautiful woman who had cared for her   and it is not unlikely saved her from a dangerous illness  it did not  seem possible to the undisciplined italian  versed only in crude   simple emotions  that a woman who was her rival could treat her with  tenderness  she accepted helen s kindness as indisputable proof that  the latter did not love the sculptor  a conclusion which the premises  scarcely warranted  she volunteered to pose again  and mrs  greyson   thinking it well to keep the girl under her influence  and desiring a  return to at least the semblance of the peaceful existence preceding  the stormy episode just ended  eagerly accepted this offer  only  stipulating that the model should undertake nothing until she was  really well able      i shall come back to supper   dr  ashton said  as he left his wife   i  have half a mind not to go to fenton s  only it amuses me to watch the  fellow s degeneration       it never amuses me to watch any degradation   she returned gravely    how do you know he is degenerating  if you mean by following his wife   why  they may be right after all  and what we call superstition the  veriest truth       of course   answered he   i never pretended to administer the  exclusive mysteries of truth  but it is always a degradation to yield  to personal influence at the expense of conviction  arthur is as much  of a heathen to day as he ever was  only he is too fond of comfort to  have the courage of his opinions      helen sighed      truth to me   she said thoughtfully   is whatever one sincerely  believes  i cannot conceive of any other standard  one man s truth is  often another s falsehood       you are as dull as a preface to night  helen  what carking care is  gnawing at your vitals       nothing in particular  a certain melancholy is befitting a widow  you  know  and that s what i am supposed to be       on the contrary there is a certain vivacity about the word widow to my  mind       your experience has been wider than mine  i am aware that i am too  much given to vast moral reflections  but you provoke them       i am sorry to provoke you   he said gayly   forgive me before supper  time  who knows what rich experiences i may have between now and then   good by      as he walked toward his appointment  could dr  ashton s vision have  reached to the house whither he was going  he would have seen arthur  fenton and his wife sitting together before an open fire awaiting their  guest  the artist was showing edith a portfolio of sketches by foreign  painters  which he had brought from his studio      what a strange uncanny thing this is   he remarked  holding one up    it is just like frontier  i never saw any thing more characteristic  i  wonder you got so few of his tricks  edith  while you studied with  him       he always repelled me  i was afraid of him  where did you get this  sketch       dr  ashton gave it to me       dr  ashton       yes  when he was in paris  both he and his wife were intimate with  frontier  or at least will was       oh  arthur      she leaned forward in her chair  her always pale face assuming a new  pallor  laying her hand upon her husband s  she asked in a quick   excited manner      do you know how frontier died       i know he died suddenly  now you speak of it  i have an idea it was a  case of  felo de se   you know i was in munich at the time       arthur   edith said earnestly   i have never told even you  but i saw  frontier die  i had a pass key to his studio  and his private rooms  were just behind it  that night i went in on my way from dinner  uncle  peter and i had been dining together  and i left him at the door with  the carriage  after a study i d forgotten  we were going to rome the  next morning  and i didn t want to leave it  the picture was at the  further end of the studio  and as i went down the room i heard voices  and saw that frontier s door was open  he sat at a table with a tiny  wine glass in his hand  a man who stood back to me said  just as i came  within hearing   it is none of my affair  and i shall not interfere   but you ll allow me to advise you not to be rash   i could not hear  frontier s answer  partly because i paid no attention  of course never  suspecting the truth  but as i went towards my easel  frontier  hearing  the noise  i suppose  and afraid of being interrupted  caught up the  glass and drank what was in it  the other man sprang forward just in  time to catch him as he fell back  and it suddenly came over me that he  was taking poison  i cried out and ran into the room  but it seemed  only an instant before it vas all over  oh  it was terrible  arthur   terrible      she covered her agitated face with her hands  as if to shut out the  vision which rose before her  her husband sat in silent astonishment  a  conviction growing in his mind of whom the other witness of frontier s  death must have been      arthur   edith broke out suddenly   that man was no better than a  murderer  he let frontier kill himself  when i cried out   oh  why  didn t you stop him   he said as coolly as if i had asked the most  trivial question   why should i  what right had i to interfere   it was  terrible  he seemed to me a perfect fiend       it was  who was it   demanded her husband  a name almost escaping him  in his excitement      it was dr  ashton  the man who is coming to sit down at your table  to night  arthur  i cannot meet him  i knew when he came to our  reception that i had seen him before  but i could not tell where  there  is his ring now  let me get by you       but where are you going   fenton asked in amazement      to my room  any where to get out of his way       but what shall i tell him       the truth  that i will not sit down to eat with a murderer      she vanished from the room  leaving her husband alone  dr  ashton s  step was already upon the stair  and however keenly mrs  fenton might  feel the wickedness of the doctor in not preventing frontier s  self destruction  the action was too strictly in accord with arthur s  own views to allow of his condemning it  his friend found him in a  state of confusion which instantly connected itself in the guest s mind  with the non appearance of edith  an impression which was strengthened  by the lameness of the excuses tendered for her absence  dr  ashton not  unnaturally concluded that he had just escaped stumbling upon a family  quarrel  he accepted whatever his host chose to say  and the two  proceeded rather gloomily to dinner     in arthur s mind there sprang an irritation against both his wife and  his friend  his instincts were all protective  that term including  comfort as well as self preservation  he was intensely annoyed at his  wife s attitude  and began to vent his spleen in cynical speeches   which since his marriage had been rare with him      christian grace   he declared   is exactly like milk  excellent and  nourishing while it is fresh  but hard to get pure  and even then sure  to sour       say something more original if you are cross  arthur   observed his  friend good humoredly   what is the matter  is it a new rug or a  japanese bronze you are dying for       hang rugs and bronzes   retorted arthur  with a vicious determination  to be ill natured   if i can get the necessities of life  i am lucky       nonsense   was the reply   it isn t that  the lack of the necessities  of life makes a man sad  it is the lack of luxuries that makes him  cynical      dr  ashton was perfectly right in his inward comment that fenton was  secretly regretting his marriage  this was the thought that filled  arthur s mind  it was true he had had no absolute disagreement with his  wife  although it is not impossible that it might have come to this   had a delay in the guest s arrival allowed time  but it filled the  husband with an unreasoning rage that edith presumed to establish so  strict a code of morals  he felt that her position as his wife demanded  more conformity to his standards  why need she trouble herself about  that which did not concern her  and sit in such lofty judgment upon the  morals of her neighbors  did she propose keeping dr  ashton s  conscience as well as her own  and his  certainly those whom the  husband found worthy his friendship it ill became the wife to  stigmatize and avoid  he sat moodily tearing his fish in pieces instead  of eating  for the moment wholly forgetting his duty as host      if you ll pardon my mentioning it   dr  ashton said at length   you  are about as cheerful company as a death s head  you are so melancholy  that i am tempted to fling in your face one of my old epigrams  that  love is a gay young bachelor who can never be persuaded to marry and  settle down      the other laughed and made an effort to shake off his gloom  but with  so little success that his guest resolved to escape at the earliest  moment possible  something in fenton s forced talk  however  attracted  dr  ashton s attention      my wife was a pupil of frontier      the simple phrase  which had escaped arthur s lips because it had been  in his mind not to allude to this fact  might have gone unnoticed had  not the speaker himself so strongly felt the shock of disclosure as to  show sudden confusion  the whole matter was at once clear to dr   ashton  who having recognized edith at the reception  had been prepared  for identification in his own turn      so that   he observed calmly   is the reason mrs  fenton does not dine  with us to night  i knew she was sure to recognize me sooner or later   but as i had no motive for concealing this matter  on the other hand i  had no reason for recalling so unpleasant a circumstance to her mind      there was a pause of a moment  and then the doctor continued      i think frontier was rather foolish  i told him so  a charming little  hungarian girl of whom he was fond  had left him to follow the fortunes  of a polish count  or something of the sort  i do not see why a man  should kill himself for so trifling a thing as a woman  but if he chose  to  i am not one of those officious persons who feel justified in  interfering with any private act they don t happen to approve  i  certainly should resent such impertinent intrusion into my own  affairs       and i   assented arthur doggedly   but my wife          certainly  i understand  mrs  fenton says hard things of me because i  would not rob poor frontier of what little comfort he could get from  dying  very well  i will not offend her by my presence  only she is  setting herself a hard task in attempting to treat people according to  their conservatism  in these days the sheep and goats have come to be  so much alike in appearance  that i scarcely see how a mere mortal is  to distinguish between them  my own case i settle for her by avoiding  her house       but this is my house   protested arthur  intensely chagrined      no   his guest replied  still smiling and moving toward the door   it  is the nest you have built for your love and your  regeneration  good  night            xxvi     there begins confusion        i henry vi   iv   i       alone in her own room  edith relieved her overwrought feelings by a  burst of tears  brief  indeed  but bitter  like her husband  she felt  that this incident  although not assuming the guise of a quarrel  was  an opening wedge in the unity of their affection  unlike arthur   however  she thought of it with self reproach and misgiving  she did  not for an instant consider the possibility of having taken a different  position in regard to dr  ashton  yet in a womanly  illogical way  she  felt that she should have learned her husband s wishes before so  vehemently declaring her own views     she heard the artist and his guest go in to dinner  and the thought  flashed upon her that this was the first time her husband had dined  without her since their marriage  she wondered if he remembered it   and  remembering  regretted  she longed for companionship  for some  friend into whose sympathetic ear she could pour her story  from whom  she might ask advice  she reflected sadly how far she was removed from  her intimate friends  of her new acquaintances many had been most kind  to her  but towards none of them  not even to her relatives  had she  been so strongly drawn as to wish now to go to them for confidence and  sympathy  unless  came a second thought  it were mrs  greyson  she was  a widow  edith reflected  and had evidently suffered much  while the  strength of her character was evident from her dealing with the italian  girl  it would be no disloyalty to go to her  there had been no words  spoken between husband and wife which could not be told a friend  and  edith felt that she needed the advice of a woman more versed in the  intricacies of life than herself     she dressed herself for walking  and slipped noiselessly out of the  house     mrs  greyson was at dinner  and was naturally surprised at seeing her  caller  but she had both too much tact and too much breeding to ask  explanations      i do hope you have not dined   she said   i am so much alone that it  is a perfect delight to me to have company  my dinner is a little like  a picnic  but if you will only consider how great a favor you are doing  me by sharing it  the consciousness of philanthropy ought to make it  palatable      neither lady mentioned arthur  although his name was uppermost in the  thoughts of both  they sat down together in helen s tiny dining room   and served by her only maid  had a charming meal  the hostess exerted  herself to entertain her guest  wisely judging that what edith said in  calmness she would be far less likely to regret than words uttered in  the unguarded moments of her excitement  she told mrs  fenton stories  of her studio life both in boston and abroad  she led edith on to speak  of her own travels and experiences  until the latter almost forgot that  she was dining in one house and her husband in another  it was not  until the coffee was reached  coffee made as only helen could make it   that the subject of the visit was really broached      how is mr  fenton   helen asked deliberately  believing the time had  come for such a question     the face of the other fell  she experienced a pang at the consciousness  of having been gay and happy  forgetful of her husband and her trouble      he is well   she answered falteringly      why did you not bring him with you   continued mrs  greyson lightly   yet with a secret determination to know the cause of her guest s  evident disturbance      he did not know i was coming   edith responded in a low voice   that  is what i came to talk about  i thought you might understand  but it  involves a third person  and perhaps i ought not to tell you  i am  sure  though   she went on  gaining confidence now that the ice was  broken   that i can trust you  a friend of arthur s came to dine  to night  and just as the door bell rang  i found him to be the man i  once saw commit murder in paris       murder   exclaimed helen  turning white   commit murder       consent to it   corrected edith  unconsciously a little pleased to  have produced so great an effect upon her usually self possessed  friend   he looked on while frontier took poison  without trying to  prevent him       but that   mrs  greyson said slowly   is hardly the same thing as  murder       it is quite as bad   edith protested earnestly   it makes me shudder  to think of his dining alone with arthur at this moment  who knows what  might happen       nothing tragic  i think   helen replied smiling   he does not go about  with pistols in his belt  i suppose       it is awful to me   edith continued  with increasing excitement  too  much stirred to notice the sarcasm   i told arthur i could not sit down  with a murderer  and just at that moment we heard his step  and i ran  away upstairs  and then i felt dreadfully  and i came to you       i thank you for your confidence  but what do you mean to do  what will  arthur tell him       the truth  i hope       he is scarcely likely to say to the guest he has himself invited that  you think him a murderer   answered her friend  smiling again   and i  am not sure that he would even look at this quite so severely as you  do       how else can he look at it   demanded edith   how else can any one  look at it  isn t it murder to take human life  and if one does not  prevent suicide when he might  isn t it the same as if he did it  himself       we will not get into a discussion   helen replied gently   i feel  about it as you do  though i believe very differently  but i see  perfectly well how a man might be strictly honest in thinking that it  was the privilege of any human being to lay aside his life when he is  weary of it  and i do not presume to condemn others for feeling what i  only think i believe       think you believe   cried the other in horror   you do not think you  believe that murder is right       assuredly not  but as there are so many related points upon which we  do not agree  would it not be better to talk of this particular case  than of general belief       but it is impossible for any one to believe as you say   persisted  edith   simply impossible  no one can believe that wrong is right       but each has his own standard      against this edith protested  but helen returned no answer  she  regretted being involved in such a debate  and resolved to let the  discussion go no further  they sat in silence a moment  and then edith  again spoke      i do not know what to do   she said   of course arthur cannot know  that man any longer  you were in paris at the time frontier died  were  you not  did you ever know         she broke off suddenly  remembering that she had not intended  disclosing the name of her guest      dr  ashton   helen returned  fixing her eyes upon her companion  and  unconsciously speaking with a deliberation which gave especial weight  to her words   yes  i know him  we went to paris together       together  was he a friend of your husband  how did you know whom i  meant      there was no perceptible pause before helen answered  but meanwhile she  determined to throw aside all concealment  she could no longer stand  before arthur fenton s wife with the humiliation of even a tacit  deception between them  she felt a spirit of defiance rising within  her  who was this woman that she assumed the right to judge them all by  standards for whose narrowness only contempt was possible  at least she  would rise above all conventional prejudices  and no longer tacitly  ask  as by silence she had done  exemption from the harsh judgments of  mrs  fenton s creed     helen was too womanly not to shrink from this disclosure  and she had  been too thoroughly educated in the faith by which edith lived not to  understand just how her life would appear seen through the latter s  belief  disconnected with a question relating to the marriage relation  and by implication casting reflection upon her delicacy and even purity  of life as a woman separated from her lawful husband  helen could have  met with dispassionate reasoning whatever assault edith made upon her   this point was too vital  it touched too closely the core of her  woman s nature  and although she retained perfectly her self control   there was a pulse of passion in her voice when she spoke      dr  ashton   she said unflinchingly   is my husband       what   cried edith      we have not found it convenient to live together   helen continued   with increasing calmness  a faint tinge of contempt creeping into her  voice   and so since my return from europe i have taken my mother s  name to avoid gossip  dr  ashton and i are very good friends still       and did mr  fenton know this   asked the other  very pale      certainly  although you understand that it is not a matter which we  discuss with the world at large  i pass  i believe  as a widow  though  i have never done or said any thing to give color to that idea      it is doubtful if helen fully comprehended the effect of these words  upon her guest  every fiber of edith s being tingled  all her most  sacred principles seemed outraged  she in some remote way felt   moreover  as if to hear without protest so lax notions of the  responsibilities of marriage was to stain her womanhood and dim the  luster of her modesty      how dared he introduce you to me   she cried   you are the wife of a  murderer and you defend his crime  you pretend to be a widow  you  ignore your marriage          stop   the hostess said with dignity   we need not go over the ground   mr  fenton made us acquainted  i presume  because he agrees with me in  seeing nothing wrong in my position  however unconventional it may be   you will see that if i had been ashamed of the fact i could easily have  kept it from your knowledge      but edith made her no answer  she was too much overwhelmed by the  various emotions which the disclosure of the evening had aroused     edith was  from helen s point of view  fatally narrow  it is true  but  the latter might have reflected that the limitations of her friend s  vision were the faiths of the christian world  and that her tenacity  arose not from obstinacy but sincerity  it is an age when belief and  doubt are brought face to face so sharply that the shock disturbs by  its jar the most ordinary affairs of life     edith was pure  high minded  simple souled  and for the rest she was  honest and earnest  her creeds were vitalized by the warm fervor with  which she clung to them  and what more could be demanded of her     she quitted the dining room  and soon helen heard the outer door close  behind her  the night gathered  and the lonely woman left behind sat  long in sad reverie  until the door was again opened to admit dr   ashton           xxvii     weighing delight and dole                 hamlet  i           dr  ashton came in too full of his own interview with arthur to notice  particularly if his wife showed signs of agitation      my dear   he said  throwing himself into a chair   it is at once one  of the latest and the wisest of my reflections that you had better  consider a newly married man as an entire stranger and form his  acquaintance quite from the foundation  wholly unbiased by any notion  you had of him as a bachelor       his wife   responded helen quietly   has been dining with me  so i  understand something of the situation  but how did arthur behave       like any husband who does not care to quarrel with his wife even when  he disapproves of her  it is upon that principle that matrimonial  felicity depends  do you say mrs  fenton has been here       yes  she came to me for sympathy and i administered it by telling her  that i am your wife       the devil  i beg your pardon  but  helen  it was precisely because i  knew she was sure to remember this frontier scrape that i wanted her  not to know  she will be very hard on you       christianity is always hard   returned she   but what difference does  it make  it was only a question of time  she is sweet and pure and  good  will  but her religion holds her in bands stronger than steel  i  couldn t long keep step with one in chains  it might as well come now  as any time      her husband looked at her with evident interest not unmixed with  admiration      she provokes me to do and to say childish things   helen continued    just to shock her  i told her bluntly the other day that i had been  telling a falsehood  and she had the impertinence to look shocked  i am  not sure that i did not go so far as to say i  lied   a word that  hardly holds the place in english that it did in the good days of mrs   opie  she would have been reconciled if i had said i told what i hoped  was true       i should have told her   laughed dr  ashton   that i only used truth  as the egyptians used straw in bricks  the smallest possible quantity  that will hold the rest together       i cannot see why arthur married her   helen said musingly      oh  as to that  an idle man will fall in love with any pretty woman  who will snub him       but arthur isn t idle  and she doesn t snub him       very well  he married her because he fell in love for no reason but  the weakness of our sex       love seems generally to be regarded by the masculine mind in the light  of a weakness       isn t it   her husband returned   love is the condition of desiring  the impossible  and if that is not a weakness  what becomes of logic       i am tired of logic   she said  rising abruptly   i am tired of every  thing  let us have supper  i want a glass of wine  i am sure i tried to  be kind to mrs  fenton  i would have helped her if i could  but how  could i assist her unless she chose to let me  and that  too  knowing  who i am       i never knew you to be other than kind   was the grave reply  which  brought to helen s cheek a faint flush of pleasure     the servant came in with supper  and the slender glasses were filled  with rhine wine      i could not help thinking   dr  ashton said  lifting his glass    i  drink to your very good health  my dear  i could not help thinking of  my wedding gift to arthur  that he asked me for it  i mean       i thought of it  too  when his wife told me the story  it is well she  does not know that of you       oh  it wouldn t matter   he said carelessly   she couldn t feel a  greater horror of me than she does already  do you see the mark of cain  on my forehead  helen       isn t it droll   she returned  with a smile half pensive  half  humorous   to feel ourselves suddenly tried by new standards and found  so wanting  i am not sure but dramatic propriety demands that i should  poison mrs  fenton  i have that vial  you know       did you notice the inscription on the vial       no  is there one       see for yourself   he answered  refilling his glass     she rose from the table and brought from a small cabinet the morocco  case  unopened since arthur had given it to her  a certain dread and  distaste had prevented her examining it  now she sat down again in her  place  a beautiful woman  with the light falling upon her from above   shining upon her golden hair  and bringing out the hues of her sea blue  dress  her husband watched her as she held the case a moment in her  delicate  firm fingers before unclasping it  he had learned within  these last weeks that his old love for helen had re awakened  or more  truly that a new affection had been born  the knowledge had come to him  through thinking upon the relations between helen and arthur and in  speculating concerning her feeling for grant herman  and it had been in  his mind when he described love as the desire for the impossible  he  had determined to speak his passion  but as he looked at his wife  sitting within arm s length yet as remote as if half the world lay  between them  he hesitated  helen unclasped the case and lifted the  tiny cut glass vial from its velvet bed      how extravagant you were in your vial   she said  involuntarily  lifting it to her nostrils      don t   dr  ashton exclaimed  leaning forward suddenly      is it so deadly as that   she asked in some dismay  holding it off      it is simply pure prussic acid   he replied   but it might be loosely  stopped      she examined carefully the minute writing engraved upon the glass       death foils the gods    she read   is it one of your own  wickednesses  will    i don t know  by the way  we might send it to  mrs  fenton now as a souvenir of the two desirable acquaintances she  has lost       what a brood of vipers she must think us  will  i think it is  pathetic  probably  but i cannot help being amused  it is rather an odd  sensation to find that instead of being the harmless  insignificant  body i have always supposed  i am really a hardened and abandoned  reprobate       oh  i ve always known it  but i did not tell you for fear of  destroying your peace of mind       i m afraid   sighed helen  rather absently   that  if you don t mind  the slang  arthur has an elephant on his hands       yes   assented the other   himself      she laughed musically  toying with the little cut glass vial      how familiarity takes away the dread of any thing   she remarked   we  become accustomed to any thing  and  while i dare say it is the  shallowest of sophistry  that ought to be an argument in favor of the  theory that vice and fearfulness are alike only strangeness       that is rather a sophistical bit of logic  so perfectly so that it  ought to be theology  excuse me  but could you let me have a morsel of  cheese       there does not seem to be any for you to have   she said  glancing  over the table      isn t there   returned he  as carelessly as if he had not noted that  fact   it is of no consequence       oh  i can easily get it  i suppose hannah forgot it      she restored the vial to its place  laying the closed case by her  plate  and left the room  the instant the door closed behind her  dr   ashton reached across the table  possessed himself of the vial   returning the case to its former position  his wife turned just outside  the door  and came back with a meaning smile to take up the empty case  and lock it again in the cabinet      i cannot trust you   she remarked with a smile   you are too eager to  foil the gods      he smiled in return  holding his wine glass up to the light      there is more where that came from   he said   you forget my  profession       of what are you musing so intently   helen queried  half an hour  later  while  the supper being ended  her husband was enjoying his  cigar      of two things which i have to communicate  one is a folly and the  other  or perhaps i should say each  is a misfortune       the folly   returned she   i forgive  the misfortune i regret  what  are they    i am glad you forgive the folly  that gives me boldness to  tell it  i have fallen in love       you  will  with whom       that is the madness of it  with my wife       will       it is the truth   he went on  half whimsically  but with a certain  ring of earnestness in his tone   i acknowledge the madness  the poor  taste of a man s falling in love with his own wife  but the fact  stubbornly remains  i have been in love with you for a long time  but i  stood back for arthur like a good fellow       i never was in love with arthur   she interrupted      it is no matter   he continued   the question is  can t you get up a  grain of grace for me  old lady      he leaned over the table  his dark eyes shining as she had never seen  them before  she was fascinated by his gaze  she felt as if the ground  were slipping from beneath her feet  and as though he were casting upon  her an evil spell  a wave of despair swept over her  must she again  submit to his power  were the old days of bitter bondage to return  was  she nothing but a puppet to his will     in this extremity a memory saved her  unable to withdraw her gaze from  her husband s face  there came to her suddenly the look in the eyes of  grant herman that day when he told her his love  the blood surged to  her cheeks  but her calmness returned      it is of no use  will   she said with gentle firmness   all that is  past forever between us  we had better not speak of it   she added  wistfully   i have so few friends that i cannot bear to lose any one of  them       my folly is then my misfortune   he responded  with no appearance of  diminished good humor   it is the pleasure of the gods to torment me  i  suppose it amuses them  the old romans were only aping them in their  blood thirsty sports  and i fancy that is the secret of their  deification  for nothing seems so much to the liking of the gods as to  torment humanity      the evident endeavor which the speaker made to appear flippant and at  his ease showed her how deeply he was moved  his wife felt this without  fully reasoning it out  and the consciousness that this self controlled  man was so stirred awoke in her a strange and powerful excitement  she  turned a shade paler  as she looked silently down into her wine glass   her own life had been too sad for her not to feel some emotion at his  words  she strove to repress the thoughts which made her bosom swell  and heave  yet it was from them her words came when she broke the  silence      it is bitterest to find one s self mistaken  to find that our gods are  only clay like the rest of humanity  i could forgive a friend for  neglect  abuse or any cruelty  but i could never forgive him for  falling below my ideal of him       you do not mean me   he returned placidly   for of me you never had an  ideal  but waiving that for a moment  i should like to tell you of my  second misfortune  if it isn t to be reckoned a blessing      she looked at him without speaking  if this disclosure were but a  repetition in varied form of the other  she had no wish to help him put  it into words  yet even as this thought passed through her mind  she  fancied she had detected in his tone some new gravity      i ve discovered   continued dr  ashton  with the same light manner he  had used throughout the interview   that i have a cancer gayly but with  grim persistency developing under my arm       oh  will   helen cried  clasping her hands   you are not in earnest       i assure you it is a very earnest matter with me  and has been for  some time  i might have an operation  i suppose  if it were worth  while  though it is so near the heart that it would be uncomfortably  risky      helen became suddenly calm  the color faded slowly from her cheeks  and  her husband  watching her narrowly  saw her beautiful lips assume a new  expression of firmness and determination  she unconsciously lifted her  head into a more erect carnage  her eyes were moist and full of  feeling  slowly in her mind formed a resolve  and with a full knowledge  of the renunciation of self which it involved  she called up all the  nobility of her soul to aid her in living up to it  creeds were little  to this woman  yet her life was formed upon the principles which give  to creeds their stability  and by which the moral is removed from the  animal      will   she at length said  slowly and gravely   could it not be  arranged for me to live with you  you did not tell me you were fond of  me without having thought out the possibilities       i should have hesitated to ask so much   was his reply   even of your  love  i shall certainly not take it of your pity       my pity   she murmured  not raising her eyes   what do you mean       you know  you cannot think me so dull as not to see that your proffer  comes not from affection  but from generosity  i thank you  but i will  accept no sacrifices      he rose as he spoke  and put out his hand      i must be going   he said in an indifferent tone   i have letters to  write that must be mailed by midnight  i am not more than half as bad   helen  as you have always persisted in thinking  i never made very  profound pretensions  but i ve treated every body squarely from my own  point of view  if they have regarded my blessings as curses  it wasn t  my fault  and i am not sufficiently hypocritical to pretend that i  think it was  good night      he gave her hand a warmer and more lingering pressure than usual      i ve had a very pleasant evening   he added   despite the admixture of  truth  young people don t like any bitters  but we old  shattered  wrecks need a dash of it in the wine of life to help digestion  good  night            xxviii     like covered fire     much ado about nothing  iii   i       that night marked an epoch in the married life of arthur and edith  fenton     the results of matrimony upon character are for the most part slow and  hardly perceptible  yet even so not without certain well defined stages  by which their progression forces itself into recognition  and in  fervid temperaments like that of the artist  any change is sure to be  rapid  and marked by sharp and sudden crises     edith returned from helen with her soul in a tumult  grant herman had  described more than her face when he applied to her the epithet  nun like  it was a source of perpetual wonderment to many of her  friends that such a girl could be so strongly attracted by arthur  fenton  but those who knew his marvelous flexibility  the unconscious  hypocrisy with which he adapted himself to any nature with which he  came in contact  and on the other hand his fascinating manner  at once  brilliant and sympathetic  felt edith s love to be the perfectly  natural consequence  she believed him to be what she wished  and he   without conscious deceit  became for the time being what she believed  him to be     it was a theory of dr  ashton s that what arthur fenton became was so  purely a question of environment as to leave the artist all but  irresponsible  this fatalistic view he had laid before his wife with  some detail  at once explaining and defending his position      if a chameleon is put upon a black tree   he said on one occasion when  the matter was under discussion   you have really no right to blame him  for becoming black too  it is simply his nature  if arthur is like that  it isn t his fault  he wasn t consulted  i fancy  about how he should  be made at all  he is self indulgent  and if a point hurts him he  glides away from it  he cannot help it       there is something in what you say   helen had reluctantly assented    but i think you put it far too strongly       oh  very likely   was the careless reply   his strongest instinct   though  is to escape pain  we are none of us better than our  instincts      to such a decision as this  had she heard it  edith  too religious to  acknowledge any thing tending towards fatalism  would not for a moment  have agreed  yet it embodied a truth destined to cause her deepest  sorrow  and which was gradually forcing itself upon her  already   although they had been married so few weeks  even her love blinded eyes  could not but perceive much in her husband which shocked and pained  her  she had not considered deeply enough  never having had the  experience which would have taught her the need of considering  how  great was the gulf between her moral standpoint and that of her  betrothed  he had seemed so yielding that she had failed to perceive  that his compliances were merely outward  and left his mental attitude  unchanged  now when it became necessary  as in every wedded life it  must sooner or later  for her to appeal to his ultimate moral belief   she was startled to find nothing with which she was in sympathy  a  cynic  or  indeed  her husband himself  would have assured her that it  was  after all  a question of standards merely  and that difference of  judgment was natural and inevitable  and that measured by his own  convictions arthur was quite well enough  her answer to such a  proposition would have been that there was but one standard  and that  what differed from that were not moral principles at all  but excuses  for immoral obliquity     outwardly  it is true  there was little in her husband s life of which  edith could complain  he accompanied her to church  and if he quizzed  the preacher after returning home  she was ready to excuse this as the  natural result of a keen appreciation of the ludicrous  he allowed her  to do as she chose in the matter of charity work  and he even refrained  from going to his studio on sunday  a sacrifice whose magnitude she had  no means of estimating  and which she therefore thought would be  continuous  it was when some ethical question arose between them that  edith was disquieted  feeling sometimes as if she were looking into  black deeps of immorality  the principles which to her were most  sacred  were to him light subjects upon which  she was well aware  only  her presence prevented his jesting  the most obvious laws of rectitude  were but thistle down before the whirlwind of his subversive theories   and edith found argument impossible with one who denied her every  premise     his old acquaintances found in arthur fenton a change more subtle but  none the less distasteful  it was a trait of his nature to assume the  character he was half unconsciously acting  as a player may between the  scenes still feel the personality he is simulating upon the stage  and  there was about fenton when he came in contact with the pagans  a vague  air of remonstrance and disapproval  even when he was as bold as ever  in his own cynical utterances      an expression of virtuous indignation isn t becoming in you  fenton    rangely said to him one day   especially in a discussion which you  started yourself by the most shocking piece of wickedness i ever  heard      and among all the pagans there existed a yet unspoken feeling that  fenton was ceasing to be one of them     on returning from helen s  edith found her husband still engaged with  dr  ashton  but as soon as the latter had gone arthur came to her room      well   he said  sinking leisurely into a chair   do you feel any  milder  have you had your dinner       yes   she returned  not leaving her seat on the opposite side of the  room   i have been dining with mrs  ashton       what   cried arthur  as if a bomb had exploded at his feet  then he  sank back into his languid position   so she has told you   he remarked  carelessly      yes  she has told me  did you know  arthur  when you brought us  together  that she was living under a false name  and under false  pretenses       i knew certainly   replied her husband with a coolness that marked his  inward irritation   that her legal name was ashton  i have still to  learn that she is living under false pretenses       is it not false   retorted edith  with difficulty controlling her  voice  her indignation increasing with every word   to pass as widow   to live separated from her husband       oh  false  why  in your stiff  conventional definition of the word  that calls the letter every thing  the spirit nothing  i dare say it is  false  but what of that  she has a right to do as she pleases  has she  not      edith drew herself back in her chair and looked at him across the dimly  lighted chamber  it is but justice to her husband to consider that he  could not dream of the anguish she suffered  it was  as he so often  said  a question of standards  by his  she was narrow  uncharitable   even bigoted  tried by the code of more orthodox circles she was simply  high minded  true and noble in her devotion to principle  she was  neither bigoted nor prudish  however the alien circumstances in which  she was placed made her appear so  to her it was a vital question of  right and purity of which arthur disposed with such contemptuous  lightness  true as the sunlight herself  no pang could be more bitter  than the knowledge that the truth was not sacred to the man she loved   her husband s words pierced her like a dagger  it was some minutes  before she answered him  he rose moodily  lit a cigar at the gas jet  and sat down again before she broke the silence      arthur   she said in a voice which was sad and full of the solemnity  of deep feeling   have you no regard for truth       truth   retorted he   to go back to pilate s conundrum   what is  truth   if you mean a strict and fantastic adherence to facts and to  stiff conventional rules  no  i haven t the slightest regard for truth   if you mean the eternal verities as a man s own nature and the occasion  interpret them  yes  i have the highest       but that is only a confusion of words  arthur  what do you mean by   eternal verities  if not adherence to facts  the eternal verities  cannot be whatever it pleases any one to say  doesn t all human  intercourse depend upon faith in one another that we will adhere to  facts  even if you do not look at the right and the wrong  there are  surely reasons enough why the truth should be sacred      her husband whiffed his cigar  idly blowing a succession of graceful  rings      you are quite a metaphysician  did you have a pleasant dinner       but  arthur   edith persisted  ignoring his attempt to break away   according to his habit  from a discussion which did not please him    but  arthur  do you think it right for mrs  greyson  mrs  ashton  i  mean  to live so       right  oh  that is the same old question in another shape  mr  candish  will answer all those theological riddles  it is his business to  they  don t interest me      he threw away his half smoked cigar  dusted his coat sleeve of a stray  fleck of ash  settled his cravat before the glass  and humming a tune  walked towards his wife  his hands clasped behind him      we do not agree  edith   he said with cold deliberation   and unless  you broaden your views  i am afraid we never shall  you are a dozen  decades behind the day  and are foolish enough to take all your church  teaches you in earnest  religion should no more be taken without salt  than radishes  the church inculcates it to excuse its own existence   but you certainly are reasonable enough to outgrow this old fashioned  puritanism       arthur   was her answer   we do not agree  and if you wait for me to  come to your standards  i am afraid you are right in saying that we  never shall  and  indeed  i hope you are right  it makes me more  unhappy than you can think   she continued  her eyes swimming with  bitter tears   that we are so far apart on what i must believe to be  vital points  on truths which i believe  arthur  with my whole soul  as  you would  too  had you not carefully educated yourself into a doubt  which cannot make you better or happier      she had risen as she spoke  and stood facing him  her pure  pale face  confronting his with a look of pathos which touched him despite  himself  she came a step nearer  and put her arms about his neck      oh  arthur   she pleaded   i love you  and how can i help mourning  that you wrong your better nature  that you resist the impulses of your  own best self      he yielded to her caresses in silence  he remembered that helen had  used this same phrase      women always appeal to one s best self   he commented inly  with a  mental shrug   which means a man s inclination to do whatever a woman  asks of him      but he kissed his wife s lips  and said  tolerantly      we will talk it over some other time  my dear  we are both tired  to night  but you are right  i suppose  as you always are      and she loosened her arms from his neck  recognizing that he had put  her appeal aside and waived the whole matter           xxix     a necessary evil     julius caesar  ii           at the st  filipe club  somewhere in the small hours of that same  night  half a dozen members were lingering  one was at the piano   recalling snatches from various composers  the air being clouded alike  with music and smoke wreaths      i think you fellows are hard on fenton   the musician protested  in  response to some remark of ainsworth s   i don t see what he s done to  make you all so down on him       it isn t any thing that he has done   tom bently replied   it is what  he has become  he has developed an entirely new side of his nature  and  a deucedly unpleasant one  too       i always had a mental reservation on fenton   remarked another   he  was always insisting that his soul was his own  don t you know  and  when a man keeps that up i always conclude that he has his private  doubts on the subject  or if he hasn t  i have       that s about the case with all the musical rowing we ve been having  for the last year or two  every musician has been in a fever lest he  should be thought to be truckling to somebody       what rubbish all this concert business is   remarked tom   in boston a  concert interests a little  clique  of people  and another bigger   clique  pretend to be interested  the nonsense that is talked  about music here is nauseating  the public doesn t really care any  thing about it  in boston a concert is given in music hall  but in  paris it is given in the whole city  it is an event there  not a  trifling incident       what do you know about music   retorted the player  clashing a furious  discord with his elbow as he turned towards the speaker   i ll attend  to you presently  now i want to know about fenton  what has he done  that you are all blackguarding him       i think he s got a creed   said ainsworth  scowling and smiling  together  according to his wont   i hate to charge a man with any thing  so black  but i think fenton s wife has made him take a creed  and a  pretty damned narrow one at that       by jove   the musician observed  solemnly   it s too bad  fenton is a  mighty bright fellow  and no end obliging       if it s only a creed   swore bently   what s all this fuss about   every body has a creed  hasn t he  a man s temperament is his creed       it isn t his having a creed that i object to   remarked grant herman    it is the question of his sincerity that troubles me  if he has taken  up some collection of dogmas merely to please his wife  who seems a  very sweet  quiet body  that is of course against him  but if he  believes it  i don t see why we should object       believes it   sniffed ainsworth  in great contempt   that is worse  than any thing i ve said  i don t think fenton is quite such an idiot  as that comes to  the idea of his believing in puritanism  oh  good  lord       puritanism   bently threw in irrelevantly  and because he liked the  sound of it   puritanism is the preliminary rottenness of new england   if he is struck with that by all means let him go  the further the  better       isn t it his night for the pagans this month   somebody inquired      yes   returned bently   but i took the liberty of going to him and  asking if he would let me take it this turn  i hope you fellows don t  mind   the talk thus flowed on in a desultory fashion amid ever  thickening clouds of tobacco smoke  and grant herman  sitting for the  most part quiet  had a whimsical idea in looking at his  half extinguished cigar  certain excellent cigars  his thoughts ran   have a way of burning sluggishly about the middle  and without actually  going out  yet need to be relighted  and in the same way a man s life  goes on better for the kindling flame of a fresh attachment in middle  life  he fell into reverie  thinking of helen and of ninitta  he had  not seen the italian since her flight  but from mrs  greyson he had  learned the story of the finding and recovery of the fugitive  and his  heart kindled with gratitude toward the woman who had prevented  consequences which he should have fruitlessly regretted  he became so  absorbed in his thoughts that only the entrance of fred rangely aroused  him      hallo  rangely   the new comer was greeted   where do you come from at  this time of night       oh  from the office of the daily day before yesterday  i had an  article in  and i wanted to read the proof  i can stand any thing in  the world better than i can endure a compositor s blunders  do any of  you know dr  ashton       i do   somebody answered   what of him       rather clever fellow  wasn t he       why  yes  i think he is  he s rather odd sometimes  what about him       dead       nonsense  i saw him myself not three hours ago  posting a letter in  the box opposite his office       he is dead  though  heart disease  they just got the news at the   advertiser  office       where was he       in his office  the night porter of the building heard him fall against  the door  they say he must have died without a struggle            xxx     how chances mock     ii henry iv   in   i       early on the following forenoon helen took her way to the studio  she  was in unusually good spirits that day  for no especial reason that she  could have told  although indeed it is possible that the prospect of  meeting grant herman may have subtly contributed to the buoyancy of her  mood     she walked briskly through the bracing morning across the common  her  mind full of bright fancies  a thin column of smoke arose from the  chimney of the lodge in the deer park  rising straight in the clear  air  and cheerfully suggestive that some tiny family  not too large for  the building  were at breakfast within  it might even be the deer  themselves  and helen smiled at her whim  almost laughing outright as a  picture arose of a matronly doe preparing coffee  while a solemn buck  sat in his easy chair before the fire  reading his morning paper and  now and then glancing at his wife over his spectacles     in this joyous mood she came to the studio  a sudden thought darted  through her mind  with no apparent connection  of the talk of the night  previous  and for an instant her face clouded  but the exhilaration of  the morning and the reaction from the sad  overstrained state in which  her husband had left her  both helped her to throw off all mournful  thoughts  ninitta had not arrived  and mrs  greyson busied herself  about the bas relief  preparing for work  suddenly the tap of grant  herman sounded upon her door      good morning   he said  entering in response to her invitation   i  knew by your step that you were in good spirits  and it gave me so much  pleasure to think you were glad to be back  that i had to come up       i am in good spirits   she returned   it is such a glorious morning   and ninitta has kept me away from my work long enough for me to be very  glad to return to it       what of ninitta   he asked  a shadow coming over his fine face   she  is not still with you       no  but she is coming to pose this morning  though i hardly think she  is strong enough      the sculptor took in his hands a bit of clay and began nervously to  model it into various shapes      why did you take her home  mrs  greyson   he asked after a moment s  silence      because she needed me   helen answered   and besides   she added  hesitatingly   i thought you would like her to be under my care       did you   he returned eagerly   i was more grateful to you than you  would let me tell you  i       he broke off abruptly as if determined to keep himself from any  dangerous demonstrativeness      come into my studio a moment   said he  throwing down the clay he  held   i have something to show you      helen followed willingly  glad to avoid the chance of their being  interrupted by the arrival of ninitta  whose jealousy might easily be  aroused again  the sculptor led the way through a couple of chambers   bringing her out at the top of the stairs leading down in the corner of  his studio  the morning sun shone in through the window far up in the  side wall  tinged to rich colors by the stained glass which herman had  set there  the statues and casts looked in the light coming from above  them  as if they had just emerged from garments of shadows which yet  lay fallen about their feet  helen uttered an exclamation of  admiration      how charming the studio is in this light   she said   it is like  looking down into a ghost world       it is a ghost world   was the response   it has long been haunted  but  i had not supposed that any eyes but my own saw the wraiths which dwell  here      the vibratory quality in his voice warned her not to answer  she felt  that she stood upon the brink of a significant interview  yet she  lacked the resolution to turn back     she descended the first flight of steps into the gallery  the sculptor  following closely  she could not have defined to herself what she  wished or intended  somewhat paradoxically she wished to escape from  herman  yet had she fled she would have been unhappy had he not  pursued  nothing is more contradictory than a nascent passion  and   indeed  the tenderness of any woman for a man is not very profound if  unmixed with some desire to escape from him     all sorts of artistic rubbish had accumulated in the little gallery   broken casts  fragments of statues and vases  pieces of time discolored  marble  and the thousand objects which make up the  debris  of a  sculptor s studio  a bit of warm colored though faded tapestry hung  dustily over the railing of the little balcony  making the  white plaster goddess appear doubly wan  against it stood a small  antique altar  around whose base a train of garland bearing cupids  danced in immortal glee      how lovely   mrs  greyson said eagerly   i never saw this altar  before  where did you get it  and why is it hidden up here       i picked it up in rome  years ago   herman returned  a trifle  shamefacedly   it came from somewhere in greece  isn t it beautiful       yes  but why is it hidden here   she repeated      the truth is that when i was young and romantic  i bought that altar  it  is a hymeneal altar  they say  and said i would pour a libation upon  it at my marriage  a sentimental and heathenish notion enough      he paused a moment  a certain hesitancy showing itself more and more  definitely in his manner  he glanced at his companion  then looked away  into the ghost world below  her heart was beating quickly  she cast  down her eyes  her hand  the whiter by contrast with the discolored  marble  resting upon the altar      when i left rome   he resumed   i could not quite make up my mind to  leave it behind  so i had it boxed up and sent home  it has been boxed  up ever since until  until recently      however determined helen might be to avoid dangerous topics  she was  yet a woman  and she had in her heart a strong yearning towards the  sculptor which could hardly be repressed  before she had considered to  what the question might lead  she asked      and recently       recently   re echoed he  regaining his composure   i took it out and  meant it to stand down in the corner there to remind me      he pointed as he spoke  down into the studio below  still dim  since  the screens covered the large windows  her glance followed his motion  in an abstracted  impersonal way      to remind you   she in turn echoed      to remind me   he took up the words again   that i am like other men   and that life is at best an aspiration  at worst a despair      she understood the intimation of his words  but it seemed not to touch  her  she did not flush or start  but regarded abstractedly the jocund  cupids  then she raised her eyes to his face      but you removed it here       yes   he said   our friend fenton once said that there is in this  world only one good  into which all others resolve themselves  the  amelioration of life  the reminder  with all its suggestiveness  was  too poignant  i ameliorated my life by putting it up here out of  sight      she did not question him further  but  gathering up her dress  turned  and went down the next flight of stairs  which brought her to a landing  eight or ten feet from the floor of the studio  there she turned again  and looked back at him descending  she almost seemed to herself not to  speak  yet by some inward volition her lips formed the words      hope is only a bubble  yet it rims with rainbows whatever we see  mirrored in it       yes   he returned  inquiringly      i was only thinking   replied she  continuing her descent   that it is  worth some pains to keep the bubble unbroken as long as possible       but facts are such achromatic glasses      to this she made no answer  and together they moved towards a modeling  stand upon which stood something covered with wet cloths  these the  sculptor carefully removed     a perfectly nude male figure was disclosed  exquisitely modeled  and  of superb proportions  it lay upon a hillock  about which fragments of  broken weapons and the torn ground indicated a recent battle  the head  and limbs of the figure drooped down the sides of the mound  falling  with the limpness of death  about the noble  lifeless head were bent  and broken stalks of poppies  ridden down by the horses  yet not wholly  destroyed     herman and mrs  greyson stood in silence looking at the figure  the  pathos of the work so penetrating helen that the tears gathered in her  eyes      what do you call it   she asked  struggling to regain composure     her companion pulled away the cloth  which still lay against the  pedestal  and she saw the words          i strew these opiate flowers      round thy restless pillow      again she was silent  perplexity  regret  and  more keenly than all  a  delicious exultation  overcame her  she stole a half glance up into the  face of the tall form beside her      but he is dead   she murmured at length      it seems so   he assented     she turned and faced him  a sudden paleness making her very lips white      i have no right to let you show me this   she cried  in a voice  thrilling with emotion   my husband is alive  i never pretended to love  him  but i am his wife  you must have seen him with arthur fenton  dr   ashton       dr  ashton   he echoed  in bewilderment   your husband  dr  ashton   teuton s friend       yes   replied she  her eyes falling  and her breast beginning to  heave   i had promised not to tell  but it was not right  i should have  told you  but i could not bear  oh   she cried  breaking off her  sentence abruptly   if you despise me it is only my due       despise you  as if it were possible  but don t you know  haven t you  been told       know  been told   demanded helen  in alarm   what is it       haven t you seen the morning paper  even       no  what was in it  has any thing happened to dr  ashton       yes   herman said slowly  wondering in a baffled way if  it was  possible to soften the blow   he is dead       dead      her cry rang out sharply in the dim studio  over that clay figure of a  lifeless warrior     a cry of horror  of pain  and  too  of remorse  there was in it nothing  of love  only that nameless fear that death brings  and still more  that groundless self reproach which sensitive natures must feel when  confronted by the irremediable  as if some blame must be taken for the  acts of fate  imaginative natures never quite shake off the  responsibility of the inevitable  and helen began instinctively to  question herself  the scene of the previous night came before her   ought she to have yielded to the love which had called her  late  aftermath of a blighted wedded life  at least when her husband spoke of  his suffering she might more strongly  a sudden thought pierced her  like a knife      how did he die   she questioned breathlessly      of heart disease      so then the world would not know the truth  if what she feared were  truth      i will go home   she said   please tell ninitta      when she reached her rooms she found a letter  addressed in dr   ashton s hand  which the penny post had left for her after she had gone  out in the morning  it contained only an impression in wax which  resembled a large seal  with hot eyes she bent over it  making nothing  of its reversed letters  then  with a sudden thought  she held it  before the glass  seeing in the mirror the words  which read backwards   like the life of him whose last act had been their forming          death foils the gods            xxxi     he speaks the mere contrary      love s labor s lost  i            edith   arthur fenton said  looking up from his paper at breakfast  that morning   dr  ashton is dead       dead   she exclaimed     her husband s indifferent tone shocked her  she was not without an  unphrased feeling that death was so sacred or at least so solemn a  subject that it should be treated with reverence  any jesting upon it  made her cringe  and the light mention of it seemed to her almost  immoral      so the paper says   replied he  and he read aloud the paragraph  containing the announcement of dr  ashton s sudden death from heart  disease   it is too bad   he commented   he was a mighty smart fellow  and square as a brick  i wonder what made him do it now       made him do what   she asked   how strangely you talk  made him die       yes  that s what i meant  i knew he had a trouble which would probably  make him do it sooner or later  but i d no idea it would come so soon       arthur  what do you mean   edith repeated  the tears coming into her  eyes   i don t like to hear you speak of death so  so  flippantly       flippantly  my dear   returned he   i m sure i don t know why you  should use that word  if a man takes his life  why shouldn t i speak of  it   to you  that is  of course i should not in public       takes his life   she cried   do you mean        of course i know nothing about it   her husband replied as coolly as  ever  and watching sharply the effect of his words   but i presume will  took poison  poor old fellow      she sank back in her chair  white and trembling      it is what might have been expected   she said   it almost seems as if  providence measured to him the portion of poor frontier       providence is noted for close observance of the  lex talionis    sneered arthur   but dr  ashton didn t believe in the existence of that  functionary  so it really ought to have passed him by  it would  certainly have been more dignified       but  oh   she cried out  apparently not hearing or not heeding his  last words   into what sort of a world have you brought me  arthur  are  all your friends so desperate that they think only of taking their own  lives  have they no faith  no hope  no beyond  i feel as if it were all  a dreadful nightmare  it cannot be you alone  for mrs  greyson and dr   ashton  oh  arthur  where has religion  where has morality gone  oh  i  cannot understand it  i cannot bear it      she laid her bowed head on her arms upon the pretty breakfast table   and sobbed as if her heart would break  her husband looked at her with  intense irritation  and an inward curse that he had ever married her   he sipped his coffee  he noted with admiration the rich  glowing hues  of the dull blue bowl of nasturtiums which adorned the table      there  edith   he said at length   it is rather idle to cry over the  sins of your neighbors  according to your creed each of us has enough  of his own derelictions to answer for  without going abroad for things  to repent  as for religion  i suppose girls who do kensington work will  use it for decorative purposes for some time to come  but thinking  people long ago outgrew such folly  in regard to my friends  it is all  a question of standards  as i ve said no end of times  from my point of  view they are very sensible people  and you a little bigot  grant  herman believes some pious nonsense  though he has too good taste to  obtrude it  and i dare say bently and rangely have their superstitions   there are probably ten thousand people in this good city of boston  and  for aught i know a hundred thousand  who believe  or  if you like   disbelieve  as i do       it cannot be true   was edith s reply   but if it is so  it is too sad  to think of       why  i suspect   arthur continued lightly   that the pagans regard me  as too orthodox lately  though you d hardly agree with them      she made no reply  and arthur continued his breakfast in silence  the  sun shone in at the windows  the soft coal fire sputtered in the grate   and to all appearance the room was full of cheerfulness  edith leaned  her head upon her hand and reflected sadly  she resolved that her  husband should be weaned from the pagans  if that were within her  power  she seemed to herself to relinquish joy in life  and to devote  herself wholly to duty     the entrance of a servant with the morning letters interrupted further  conversation  until arthur tossed his wife a letter which dr  ashton  had mailed at the same time he posted the missive which helen received  later in the day      there  you see   fenton remarked   of course i show it to you in  confidence      the room swam before edith as she read  but she forced herself to be  outwardly calm  as she ran her eye over this note       dear arthur       i ve a strong presentiment  and although i disbelieve in presentiments   mine generally come true  that in about half an hour my obituary will  be in order  certain easily foreseen contingencies have determined me  to give it up  i shall never have a better chance to make my exit  dramatically  and you ve often assured me that that is the chief thing  to consider in this connection  i ve contemplated such a possibility  long enough to have my affairs in order  and doubtless your wife will  have a mass or two said for the repose of my soul  if you ever have a  chance to do helen a good turn  you may regard it as a personal favor  to my ghost to do it  i ve left you my diaz as a sort of propitiatory  sop     yours  of course  as ever         w  a        oh  arthur  arthur   edith sobbed  breaking down again   it is awful   it is just as he always talked  it is as light as if he were going out  to drive       naturally   was the response   if you fancy will would cry baby at  death  you knew him far from as well as i did  how strange it is to  think of his being in the past tense  poor fellow  it was clever of him  to leave me his diaz  i always coveted it      in the face of this  what was there for edith to say  she was simply  numbed to silence  and horror at her husband for the time deadened all  sense of the shock of dr  ashton s death  it was not until later in the  day that she was able to think of helen      but  arthur   she said then   mrs  greyson       well  what of mrs  greyson       i am going to see her       after your last night s indignation       i may have been wrong   mrs  fenton said bravely   i may have been  hard  i realize every day how little i am able to judge for other  people  perhaps i am narrow  as you say  at least now her husband is  dead i can show her my sympathy  and since i know more of him  it does  not seem so strange that she left him       they left each other   he responded to these contradictory words   but  what can you say  the consolations of religion will hardly be  available  and helen never pretended to love ashton      his tone wounded her  but she answered without a change of countenance      the death of the man who has been her husband can never be indifferent  to any true woman  i shall not force her to listen to any religion she  does not wish to hear            xxxii     a sympathy of woe     titus andronicus  iii   i        i am afraid you will think me intrusive   was edith s hesitating  greeting to helen   but i could not help coming  i thought you might  feel lonely      helen looked at her for a moment with wistful eyes and trembling lips   then she crossed swiftly to where her friend stood and kissed her  and  never could these two be so wholly separated or estranged again as to  efface the memory of all the meaning that this caress conveyed  the  word which edith had used had been most happily chosen  her woman s  instinct divined the loneliness which overwhelmed the widow  and this  proof of her sympathy was the passport to mrs  greyson s heart   loneliness was the feeling of which helen was most of all conscious   the death of even an indifferent acquaintance often may seem to  desolate the earth from its simple irremediableness  and much more does  the removal of one near to us make the world appear half a void     helen had been sitting alone before edith came  reviewing her past and  drearily speculating of her future  she went over the days of her  wedded life  her innocent  introspective childhood  in which she had  dreamed and read  dwelling in a world apart  alone but for the ideal  creations of her books or her own quick fancy  she had married knowing  as little of life or of love  as when  a lonely child  she had spelled  out the tale of prince camaralzaman  and wondered what the divine  passion really was  or if indeed it had existence  outside of fairy  lore     the torch of death throws its glare backward  and its funeral light  showed many a past long since forgotten  but now revealed with new and  distorting vividness  helen remembered the baby which had lived but  long enough to open its eyes with a smile that seemed of recognition   and then faded back into the unknown whence it had come  a throb of  tenderness for the dead father moved the mother s heart as she thought  of her baby  so little time hers  and so long asleep under the  marguerites of a grave over the sea  she had suffered much from the  selfishness  the dominant self will  the distorted views of life of dr   ashton  and these things she even now could not forget  but  too  she  thought of him as the father of her child  her baby ever dear and  living in memory     she reflected  too  of the men she had known  and especially of arthur  fenton  her nature had need of some one upon whom to expend its  treasures  and she realized that had she not felt in the artist a  certain insincerity  he might have awakened her love  he had been  appreciative  sympathetic  brilliant  and  too  he had called largely  upon her patience and forbearance  than which there is no surer way to  win a generous woman s affection  yet always some note rang false to  her fine ear  and to the weakness of his nature she had never been  wholly blind  although not until his marriage had given him a certain  distance had she realized how deep and unsparing her knowledge of him  really was     of grant herman she would not think  thoughts of him arose again and  again in her mind  but she resolutely put them down  some secret stir  of mingled pain and joy told her too well that the sculptor had  awakened the first love of her life  but at least with her husband   however unloved  lying yet unburied  she would not dwell upon the  passion of another     she took edith s hand  and the two women sat down side by side   shedding tears together  rather from a sense of the general woe and  bitterness of life than for poignant grief for the present calamity  it  was not much they said at first  neither was of the talkative order of  women  finding comfort in the mere utterance of words  they grew  together  sustained by giving and receiving tenderness  and each  tacitly asking and according forgiveness for unfriendly feelings in the  past  it is probable  too  that edith  heavy with the disappointments  of her married life  found relief in being able to weep unrestrainedly   even though the true source of her tears was not the obvious one      i never loved him   helen said of her husband   after we separated we  became friends  rather because of a common past when we were both  strangers here  than from any fitness for each other  but he was once  my husband      her friend pressed her hand in silence      we had a child   helen spoke again   a little daughter  she only lived  one day  if she had not gone it might have been different  at least we  should have kept on together  my poor little baby      edith s eyes were full of tears  as she answered softly      i hope you will let me say that i believe she is waiting for you some  where       she must be   the mother responded quickly   whatever one doubts  one  must surely believe that  i could not lose her  she is mine  wherever  in the universe she may be       yes   was all edith ventured in reply   i am sure of it      they gave no heed to the fading day  but sat with clasped hands until  twilight had gathered  and it occurred at last to mrs  fenton that her  husband and dinner must be awaiting her  helen had been telling of her  plans      i shall go abroad   she said   i want to study in rome  i want to meet  great men  to be influenced by great works  i have been thinking of it  for a long time  and now it seems as if some ties that held me here are  broken  for we often obey claims which we yet deny  and besides   she  added  in a lower tone   it is a flight from temptation  i am in danger  here       in danger   edith asked wonderingly      only from myself   was the reply   but that peril is sufficiently  imminent to make me afraid      edith questioned no further  and to the true import of these words she  had no clue  she looked at her friend a moment inquiringly and  musingly  but as helen did not continue  she rose to go      i must get home now   she said  in a tone so tender that it seemed to  beg pardon for this abandonment   arthur is waiting for me and his  dinner  and if he doesn t get the latter at least  i won t answer for  the consequences  mr  calvin was with him when i came away       mr  peter calvin   exclaimed the other  in some surprise      yes  he has bought one of arthur s pictures  and he wants arthur to  propose him at the st  filipe club  i believe      she spoke in perfect ignorance of the tumult her words excited in her  hearer s mind  long after edith was gone helen sat looking out into the  darkening sky and thinking of arthur fenton  she had heard him talk too  often about mr  peter calvin not to know what was implied by this new  friendship  mr  peter calvin had been for years the head and front of  boston philistinism in art  he had been the patron of subservient  artists  the chairman of committees for the purchase of public statues   an elegant writer upon such live and timely topics as  plaster  casting among the egyptians  notes upon abyssinian statues   while  his monograph upon the question   what was the original cost of the  venus de milo   had by his flatterers been pronounced the  masterpiece of all known art essays for power and critical research   his was a prominent name upon the covers of dilettante art journals  it  was he who effectually crushed young and too daringly independent  artists  who repressed impertinent originality  who headed the hosts of  conventionality against individuality or genius which held itself above  the established canons of antiquated tradition  he was the high priest  of boston conservatism  the presiding genius of philistia  and until  the st  filipe club entered a protest against him by refusing to admit  him to membership  his power had scarcely received a blow     tom bently always insisted  with much profanity  that mr  peter calvin  was a joke      he writes with tremendous pomposity   tom would say   and he is in no  end of societies for molly coddling art  he goes on  too  about the  plaster casts at that hospital for decrepit gods  the art museum  as if  his whole soul was in the plaster barrels of the greeks  but bless your  soul  it s only his little joke  he doesn t really mean any thing by  it  he s only a stupendous joke himself      the pagans  so far as they were to be regarded as an entity   represented the protest of the artistic soul against shams  they stood  for sincerity above everything  for utter honesty in art  in life  in  manners and morals alike  to them philistinism was the substitution of  convention for conviction  for the spirit of imitation  of blind  subservience to authority  the pagans had no tolerance  while they held  themselves always open to conviction  they refused assent to any thing  which was offered them  ex cathedra   they devoted themselves to  art with a passion of enthusiasm which was in itself the highest  expression of their principles  that they seemed often iconoclastic was  in reality less the result of their hatred of authority than the  prevalence of unreasoning  and therefore by their standards necessarily  insincere  adherence to established formulae  dogmas they hated  not  because they were popularly received  but because although they had  been vital realities to their originators  they had become in time mere  lifeless forms  held in reverence by blind devotees long after the soul  had gone out of them     in art especially the pagans demanded the most absolute surrender of  self to truth  and it should be added that they defined truth exactly  as helen did   that which one sincerely believes   they had no  condemnation too severe or sweeping for the artist who worshipped the  golden gods of philistia by following popular conventions at the  expense of his honest art ideals  it is not impossible that they  carried this feeling to extremes sometimes  suspecting every thing  which was stamped with popular approval  but in the main at least their  standard was of the highest and their lives conformed well to it   measured by the creeds they rejected  they might often enough be found  wanting  tried by their own  there had never been an apostate among  them until the defection of fenton     no one had been more bitter and outspoken in his condemnation of mr   calvin and of what he represented than arthur fenton  many a time he  had entertained helen with stories of the presumption and the ignorance  of this man whom now he was receiving into his friendship  or  more  properly  in whose train of sycophants he had taken his place     helen could not forgive him  leaving dinner untasted  she sat with  burning cheeks in the darkness  mourning over the apostacy of the man  who had been her warmest friend           xxxiii     a mint of phrases in his brain         love s labor s lost  i           dr  ashton had been in his grave several weeks  life had gone on much  as usual in boston  with the bickerings of small souls the gaping  imitations of the mob  the carping of the self appointed critics  and  the earnest endeavor of the honest and inspired workers  who leaven the  lump of modern civilization     among the pagans the nomination of mr  calvin to the st  filipe club by  arthur fenton had been received with a bitterness born of a feeling of  outraged confidence  they were to night to meet in tom bently s studio   and fenton  who had no intention of being present  was yet keenly  conscious of what the talk there concerning him would be  he was glum  and moody at dinner  and edith  who knew that this was pagan night   watched him wistfully  she hoped to win him away from friends and  acquaintances who seemed to her dangerous  perfectly honest and ready  to lay down her life for her husband  she was yet urging him into paths  which he felt it to be degradation to walk  since they led him away  from sincerity  she had no means of knowing how his sudden championship  of mr  calvin was regarded  her own relations to art had been those of  pretty amateurishness  she had been bred to believe in conventionality   and the flavor of bohemianism alarmed and repelled her     to night she had put on her most becoming dress  she had ordered the  dinner with especial reference to her husband s tastes  and she exerted  herself to be as entertaining and attractive as lay in her power  she  even allowed herself the innocent ruse of delaying dinner a little   that it might be later before arthur could be ready to go out  and when  the answer to her timid hope that he was to be at home that evening   was in the affirmative  her foolish  tender heart fluttered with  delighted hope that she was influencing him to shake off his irregular  associations     he was rather gloomy and silent all the evening  brooding of the  pagans  from whose meetings he had never before been absent  and of  helen  and what she would think  edith tried all her arts and wiles to  make him forget the pleasure he was losing  and she partly succeeded   since her attentions and endearments chimed in with the train of  thought by which he was endeavoring to prove to his own satisfaction  that he was the most virtuous of men  and that his swearing allegiance  to philistinism  was a noble example of a transgressor willing to  confess and abjure his faults  he accepted his wife s attentions as  eminently fitting under the circumstances  and could he have forgotten  the pagans and helen  he might almost have been comfortable  more than  once in the old days he had found it hard to face mrs  greyson s clear  eyes  which saw so readily through shams  and now while he was able to  work himself into a defensive attitude towards all others of his old  friends  he felt a horrible humiliation in the consciousness that helen  was sure to know of his course and to understand all its weakness     it occurred to him  too  that helen had avoided him of late  since the  death of dr  ashton  he had scarcely seen her  although she was often  with his wife  he knew from edith that she was soon to go abroad  and  he wondered if the wish to escape him had any share in bringing her to  this decision     he tormented himself with speculations and memories until he could  endure it no longer  he must have comfort  his wounded self sufficiency  craved the balm of approval  and although he was contemptuously  conscious of his own weakness  he turned to edith to seek admiration  and praise      so you are glad that i am not going to the pagans to night   he said  to her  as they sat before the fire  for the evening was damp and  chilly      very glad   she answered  leaving her chair to come and sit upon a low  hassock by his knee   it was so good of you      she made a beautiful picture as she sat there  her long dress of  cardinal and stone gray silk gathered in waves about her  the  elizabethan ruffle setting off her shapely head and slender neck  while  the soft  yellow old lace showed how clear was the tone of her skin   her pure  sweet face  with its appealing dark eyes  was turned upward  to her husband s  in an expression at once wistful and full of love   edith had always a highbred air  and to night her attitude and  expression added the one charm of warmth and softness needed to make  her most lovely and moving      you doubtless have some excellent reason   remarked arthur smiling  down on her      i am afraid of them  they are in arms against every thing that is  acknowledged to be good       and yet they are the most honest men i ever knew   he returned  half  musing  and with a little pleased sense of his magnanimity in saying  this at a moment when they were probably abusing him      i don t know  arthur  perhaps they may be honest  but i am sure it is  not good for you to be with them  they are so sure that their false  views of life are true      the little sting in the implication that he was not able to resist the  influence which had surrounded him was forgotten in the satisfactory  view which his wife took of the real value of the judgments of the  pagans  he knew how little she understood them  with every premise upon  which her conclusions were founded he disagreed  yet he said to himself  that edith was right  that the pagans were quite too infallible about  every thing  they would have him grope along poor and unknown  he  argued with himself  simply for the sake of standing in the position of  chronic rebuke to established authorities  with only now and then a  chance to get a hearing upon what they assumed to be the true theory of  art  what they believed  ah  there after all was the weakness of the  whole  what ground had they for their belief  did he himself really  believe any thing  or had he a right to assert in any matter a positive  conviction  and even if they or he asserted never so strongly  what  sort of a test of truth was that  after all the philistines  the  calvins  were as likely to be right as were a set of discontented if  not disappointed artists  men whose natures would never allow them to  be satisfied with any existing state of things  since it would  inevitably differ from their dreamy ideals  and it was certainly true  that the weight of authority and of numbers was with the philistines      perhaps you are right  edith   he said aloud   i hope so at least  for  they are probably indignant enough with me       with you  why       oh  they choose to think i went over to philistia when i proposed mr   calvin for the st  filipe  i m sure i don t see why i haven t a right  to propose whom i please       but mr  calvin  arthur   responded edith  who regarded that gentleman  as one of the art gods of boston   i should think any body would be  proud to propose him  why  he is one of the most distinguished men in  the city      her husband did not answer for a moment  he looked into the fire and  watched his inner consciousness adapt itself to this view of the case   which than himself no one had condemned more bitterly  yet it was the  theory upon which it was necessary to rest did he expect to arrive at  any comfort in the course of supporting mr  calvin  which he had  already pursued so far that retreat was impossible  yes  he assured  himself  he could even accept this  and why not  did not common opinion  confirm it  and however much common opinion might be sneered at  it was  surely the voice of the common sense of the world     he looked down at his wife  who looked back smiling proudly  he  realized how pure  how tender  how true she was  he knew  too  that she  was daily and hourly weaving about him bands which held him captive to  beliefs which though true to her were the veriest falsehoods to him   and that only his love of ease  his fatal complaisance  prevented his  rending these cords as did samson the new ropes of the philistines  he  realized that he was sacrificing his manhood  that he was bartering his  convictions for flattery and ease by allying himself to calvin and his  following  he recalled helen s remark that what is called being honest  with one s self is often the subtlest form of hypocrisy  and he did not  spare himself a single pang of self humiliation and contempt  and then   when he was full to the throat with self loathing  he let his sensuous   self loving nature devise excuse and soothe his wounded vanity     he looked into the fire with a smile of mingled bitterness and  complacency  half ashamed  half amused at the view which introspection  gave him     but whenever into his musings came the thought of helen it rankled like  a poisoned barb  for he secretly believed that helen loved him  and  although if a man humiliates himself in the eyes of the woman he loves  it is as bitter as death  yet to prove unworthy in the sight of her who  hopelessly loves him  contains a more subtly envenomed shaft  which  wounds that most sensitive spot in a sensuous man s nature  his vanity           xxxiv     heart burning heat of duty     love s labor s lost  i   i       that evening helen too sat at home  alone and full of resistless  thoughts     she had put the finishing touches to the  flight of the months    completing the work with scarcely less success than at first  and in  three days she was to sail for europe  she had not allowed dr  ashton s  death to interrupt her work  the necessity of avoiding unpleasant  gossip which would be provoked by the disclosure of her relations with  the dead man  being sufficient reason why she should not change her  outward life  she quietly and rapidly completed the preparations for  departure  and already the feeling of severance from familiar scenes  cast its sadness over her     leaving the studio to day  she had gone down to speak with herman  whom  she wished to take the responsibility of the firing of the bas relief   when she had finished this errand she turned to a figure in terra cotta  whose freshness showed that it had but recently come from the kiln      what is this   she asked   i have never seen it       it is a pasht   the sculptor returned   i modeled it as a wedding  present for arthur fenton  but luckily i did not get it done in time       why  luckily        because i should be sorry to have given him any thing so closely  connected with the pagans  as things have turned out      helen did not need to ask explanations of these words  although she did  not know how complete the breach between fenton and his former friends  had become      i am glad i am going away   she exclaimed with a sigh      going away   he echoed  dropping his modeling tools      yes  i sail saturday      she spoke with perfect composure  yet her glance was averted  she was  painfully conscious of having concealed the fact from him until this  moment     he came towards her  his eyes fixed upon her face      what does this mean   he demanded  almost fiercely   why do you go       i mean to study in rome   she replied faintly   i always told you that  i hoped to go some day       but why do you go now  why have you concealed it from me  are you  afraid of my  of my love  if any one must go it should be i  i have no  right to drive you away       you are not driving me away  i  it is better that i should go       but why go now  now you are free  and i have a right to claim you       no   helen said in a voice suddenly firm  but which yet showed her  inward agitation   no  there is ninitta  i have suffered too much  myself to be willing to try to come to happiness over any woman s  heart  it is better that i should go       ninitta   herman burst out   she has no claim  she will not even care   she        no   interrupted helen  laying her hand upon his arm   you cannot say  that  you know it is not true  you can see as well as i that ninitta is  pining her life out over your neglect  we are not free to break her  heart when you yourself taught her to love       i have never been unkind to her   he said  a little defiantly   except  perhaps when she acted like a mad woman and broke your figures       in love   returned helen  smiling faintly  and glad to take refuge in  generalities   sins of commission  as compared with the deadly sin of  omission  are mere venial offenses  it is not what you have done  but  what you have left undone       but what can i do  i cannot force myself to love her       you have made her love you       but i outgrew her centuries ago       the price of growth is always to outgrow   replied helen     she was struggling hard to keep the conversation away from dangerous  levels  she felt that she must seem heartless  but none the less she  went on bravely      and after all what is outgrowing  it is a question of moods  of       but her courage failed her  her voice trembled  she turned away from  him and walked down the studio  stopping here and there as if to  examine a cast or a figure  invisible through the tears which welled up  in her eyes  the sculptor followed close behind her  until she put her  hand upon the great oran rug which hung before the door      then you leave me   he broke out bitterly   you make ninitta a pretext  for escaping me  you might have told me that you did not care for me  i  would not have molested you      she turned to him suddenly  and he was startled by the whiteness of her  face  for she was pale to the very lips      do you think it is easy for me to go   she cried passionately   to  give you up when i love you  you should help me  not make it harder   isn t it better to part now while we have nothing to regret than to  live with a wrong between us       but what wrong will be between us  surely that boyish mistake need not  blight both our lives       can we help it   she asked sadly      we will help it  are we merely puppets then  to be bandied about  helplessly  i told her i loved her  it is no longer true  and why is  the pledge that followed binding       it is not simply that you gave her your word   helen returned   struggling bravely with herself   it is that you made her love you  and  that obligation you can never shake off  oh  it is because you are too  noble to take a woman s love and then trample upon it  that i love  you  that you fill my heart      she poured out the words  her eyes blazing  her splendid form dilated   her arms involuntarily extended towards him  he took her into his  embrace  not hastily  not wildly  but with a slow  irresistible movement  that had in it something of solemnity  he showered kisses upon her  hair  her forehead  her lips  he pressed her to his bosom as if he  would absorb her into himself      my darling  my darling   he said  in a hoarse  fiery whisper   i  cannot give you up  think how lonely i am  how i love you      she put up her face and kissed him with a long  clinging kiss  then she  freed herself from his arms  they stood face to face  her eyes  appealing  until his glance fell before hers      yes   he said in a voice so low that she bent forward to listen   yes   you must be right       i am right   she responded sadly   i have fought against it too much  not to be sure of that       it is an odd way of proving my love for you to give you up   continued  herman  with a new accent of bitterness in his voice   oh  the folly of  that boyish passion      he strode away from her  as she leaned panting against a modeling  stand  the darkness was gathering so rapidly that when he turned back  his face came out of the gloom like a surprise      my reward   he said   must be that you love me  but that very reward  makes it harder to deserve it  i am sure that we would be wiser and  happier if we had no scruples to hamper us       but we have   was her response   to take your own words  we are not  mere puppets      again he walked away from her  and for a few moments there was no sound  but that of his heavy footsteps  which seemed to make the silence more  solemn and penetrating      i will do whatever you ask   he burst out suddenly   i will even marry  her if you wish       i ask nothing  it is not i but your convictions you should follow  i  am not even able to advise  your own instincts are better and nobler  than any thing i can say to you   she stopped and choked back a sob    oh  grant  it is so hard   she cried     she had never used that name before  and it so thrilled him with joy  and pain that he made an impulsive movement as if once more to take her  in his arms  but she lifted her hand with a gesture of negation      i have been tempted as well as you   she continued   i have said to  myself a thousand times that love justified all  and that these  theories were too fine spun  i could not keep the thought of you down  even when i first knew i was a widow  and i said over and over to  myself that now no one stood between us  i knew it was no use  but i  lay awake in the night and tried to prove to myself that ninitta had no  claim   but  oh  you are too much to me for me to be willing that you  should do what we both know is wrong and cruel  i can endure anything  better than that you should not always be my ideal  and i should hate  myself if i tempted you to wrong       what i am   he said brokenly  moved most of all by the tears upon her  cheeks   is nothing  you have beaten this temptation  not i  i would  have done any thing if you had encouraged me  i am a very ordinary  mortal  helen  when one really knows my littleness      she smiled through her tears at him      you shall not abuse yourself   she replied   i will not have it      there was not much further said between them  they remained together  until the dusk filled the studio  and it looked again like a  ghost world as on the morning they two had come into it to see the dead  form modeled in red clay  perhaps it was upon this remembrance that at  length mrs  greyson said      will you give me  before i go to europe  that figure you showed me       i will give you any thing you ask   he answered   i wish i might add  myself  is it right   he added  with sudden fire   for me to tie myself  to that model girl  am i worth nothing better than that       you are worth the best woman on earth  but  oh i cannot argue it  but  i feel it  i am sure that it cannot be right to deny the claim which  you yourself gave her  grant  i know by myself what it would be to lose  you       but she is not the woman you are  her feelings are those of an  ignorant peasant  she       helen laid her fingers lightly upon his lips      no   she said   don t go on  we have said it all once  you are trying  to out argue your own convictions  i must go now  it is almost dark  already      she took a step or two towards the door and again laid her hand upon  the rug  portiere   then as by a common impulse they turned  towards each other  and once more she was locked in his embrace     and to night  sitting alone in the dark  with dilated eyes  helen felt  still the ecstasy of that moment  but murmured to herself      it must not be again  i will not see him alone            xxxv     parted our fellowship           othello  ii   i       tom bently s studio that night was a sight well worth seeing     tom had two rooms in studio building  opening into each other by  folding doors  which were never known to be shut  the walls were hung  with old french tapestry  its rich  soft colors harmonizing exquisitely  with some dull red velvet draperies from venice  bits of armor  some of  them very splendid  were disposed here and there  while a wealth of   bric a brac  enriched every nook and corner  in the doorway hung  an old altar lamp of silver  with a cup of ruby glass  and from various  points depended other lamps of moresque and antique shapes  a pair of  tall brass flambeau stands  spoil of a belgian cathedral sacked a  couple of centuries ago  upheld the heaviest candles tom had been able  to find  which smoked and flared most picturesquely     bently had traveled widely  every where picking up graceful and  artistic trifles  stuffs from algiers  rugs from persia and turkey   weapons from tripoli and india and tunis  musical instruments from  egypt and spain  antiques from greece and germany and italy  and  pottery from every where  his studio was the envy of all his brother  artists  although he himself growled about it profanely  declaring that  he had so much rubbish about him that he could not work  yet  nevertheless declining to part with a single object      i ought to clear the place out   he would say   my pictures are  getting to look like advertisements of an old clo  shop  and if a man  doesn t change all his properties every year  the sapient critics say  he has become mannered  but i can t let them go  or rather they won t  let me go  they hang on like barnacles to an old hulk      the pagans were six that night  fenton s place being unfilled  the  delinquency of the absent artist was a good deal commented upon  yet  always as if an effort were made to keep the subject out of the  conversation  it came up again and again  and that not unnaturally   since it was necessarily in every man s thoughts      he s a mellifluous coward  now isn t he   bently remarked  with his  usual picturesque disregard of the conventional use of words   the  average american couldn t have been more sneaking       he was always afraid of the rough grain of life   rangely responded    i always told him he was a born coward  he could never serve any cause  that wouldn t give him a uniform of broadcloth  but he was born for  something better than tagging after calvin and his tribe  heaven  knows       bah   went on bently   the bad taste of it  i could get over every  thing else  but the bad taste of proving a sneak  and giving up every  thing worth while      somebody threw in a quotation from browning s  lost leader   and  then grant herman  trying to turn the conversation  took up bently s  remark      you re right  tom   he said   in your view of taste  taste is  sublimated morality  it is the appreciation of the proportion and  fitness of all things in the universe  and of course it is above simple  morality  for that is founded upon a partial view  taste is the  universal  where a system of morals is the local       can t you say that of art   asked rangely   i should think art is the  universal  where religion is the provincial  a religion expresses the  needs and the aspirations of a race or a country  while art embodies  the aspirations and attributes of humanity       good   bently responded   that is better than i should have said it   but it s my belief  all the same  there are so few people who have  imagination enough even to understand what one means by saying that art  is the only thing in the world worth living for  why  art is the  supreme expression of humanity  the apotheosis of all the best there is  in the race       i don t see that   objected another   isn t religion the expression of  the longings of the soul  or whatever there is in us we call soul  i  can t say it well  but it seems to me you talk of religions  not  religion       people seldom take the trouble to make that distinction  he who  attacks any of the religions is generally set down as striking at  religion itself       religion   returned bently   is the expression of fear  and nothing  else  if you sift it to the bottom  knowledge kills so called religion  as surely as it does those lower forms of belief which it is nowadays  the fashion to dub superstition  it is precisely the same feeling that  builds churches and that rhymes the country hag s charms  fairies and  saints are double and twisted cousins  after all       but religion   persisted the german   is more than the expression of  fear  it is the embodiment of the aspirations of mankind  of the  instinct and desire for worship       for worshipping something   amended tom   that is the same thing  differently phrased       no  it isn t  either  to yearn for the higher is not to show that we  fear it  but that we long to grow like it  it is a confession of  incompleteness  of weakness  i grant you  but a thousand times no to  your calling it fear       i confess to having been hasty  and modify my words so far as to say   an expression of fear or weakness       is there then any shame in acknowledging weakness   demanded the  german  pushing him as hard as he was able   it certainly is honest       is there any shame to formulating fear   retorted the other  deftly  evading him      then see how religion always appeals to art to help out its ultimate  expression   observed rangely      and how it has failed   added bently   when it has not had art to help  it  puritanism tried to get on without art  and where is puritanism   you couldn t find a trace of it  if it hadn t come down on its  marrow bones and begged art to build its churches  compose its music   and regulate its rituals       it is no more fair to say that   objected another pagan  doggedly    than to say that art has gone to religion for help  their accounts are  pretty evenly balanced       nonsense   rangely returned   art has never gained by being religious   but by being art  but religion owes its hold largely to the help art  has given it       and it has paid its debts by blackguarding art from every pulpit it  has builded for it       as fenton used to say   ainsworth remarked   art has been used as the  sugar coating to the bitter pill of religion       oh  fenton again   bently exclaimed impatiently   what did you bring  him up for  who the devil would have thought fenton would have turned  out so       i can tell you a piece of news   said rangely   the election committee  blackballed calvin this afternoon       good   cried they all  and some body added   but fenton said he d  resign if calvin wasn t elected       resign   echoed rangely   i guess he ll have to  he s been sent to  coventry by half the club now for that graves affair       the graves affair   some one queried   what s that  what else has he  been doing  if a man starts to go to the devil  it does seem as if he  never could get ahead fast enough       miss graves was going to buy one of flackerman s pictures  and heaven  knows he needs the money  and fenton  who has always pretended to be  flack s friend  talked her into taking one of his instead  or rather he  got calvin to go to her and do it  it was a stunning flackerman  too   and we were all rejoicing over his luck       i would not be too ready to believe that story   grant herman said   i  don t think fenton s gone utterly to the bad all at once  he s living  expensively  they say  and possibly he let calvin go to miss graves   but i don t believe arthur ever originated that sneaking scheme  and i  shouldn t be surprised if he never knew the rights of the case       he s done what so many artists have been bullied into doing before    ainsworth observed   if he has sold his birthright for a mess of  pottage  that is precisely what the patrons of art in this country  demand that every man shall do who comes here  i could tell you of a  dozen good fellows who ve been spoiled in that way  i am far enough  outside to look on in an unbiased way  but they treat us architects in  the same fashion  lots of the most rubbishy and conventional men we  have  started out to be fair and work from conviction  and they simply  had the choice between subservience and starvation  and cases of the  choice of death from starvation haven t been over plenty       oh  a man is known by the tailor he keeps   threw in rangely    especially if he doesn t pay him       it s all a game of cut throat   bently remarked philosophically   art  and business alike       i should hate to have my throat cut   observed the german pagan in a  matter of fact tone   it must let a dreadful draught into the system       oh  if you were beheaded   cried rangely   you d turn into a capital  beer fountain  so your friends would find some consolation  even in  your loss      a diversion was caused here by the production of a splendid japanese  punch bowl  supported upon a teakwood stand  in it the host proceeded  to brew a potent and steaming mixture  whose fragrance must have  delighted the jocund gods of jollity and laughter  tom was notorious  for being chronically in pecuniary difficulties  but he was always  adding to his collection of  bibelots   and he never was known to  lack the means of concocting a glorious punch      ye gods   exclaimed ainsworth   how good that smells  it almost  overcomes the general mustiness of tom s den here  which usually has  all the odors of the ghetto from which his things are dragged       casper is intoxicated already with the mere fumes   retorted bently  good humoredly   he s bound to fill a drunkard s grave sooner or  later       no  i never shall   chuckled the other   i m altogether too good  natured to crowd the drunkard out      this sally was received with applause  and the glasses being filled   the usual toasts to the goddess pasht and to art were drank      and to our seven   went on herman  holding up his glass  and going on  with the formula they had  half unconsciously  fallen into the habit of  using  although they made no pretense of having a ritual     but he set his glass down untasted  suddenly remembering that their  ranks were broken  and the others followed his example      the difference between religion and art   broke out rangely   hurriedly  to cover the awkward silence which followed   is that  religion is a matter of tradition  of convention  it rests upon  authority  while art springs from inner conviction       sophistry   retorted the german  picking up the gauntlet   there have  been a good many things said here to night which sound well but won t  stand fire  it is precisely for following conventions in art that we  blame fenton       and that proves my point       no  it doesn t  there s as much art that depends upon tradition as  there is religion       no   replied rangely   in so far as art gets its inspiration from  fossil tradition it is lifeless and indeed ceases to be art  religion  presupposes something exterior  while art is the outgrowth of the  individual s own mind  the best expression of his inner strength       religion   herman threw in   demands the existence of the unknown  art  only the existence of the inexpressible       yet art devotes itself to expression       yes  but more to suggesting  it phrases the possible so as to suggest  that which is above and beyond expression  yet toward which it helps  the emotions and the imagination  i think a man s soul a matter of very  little moment as compared to his imagination  and it is because art  ministers to the latter that i place it above religion      the talk was diverted here by some laughing remark which led on to a  train of gay badinage  the german tried to bring the conversation back  to serious levels  but in vain      oh  what fustian we ve given ourselves up to to night   laughed  rangely      it amuses me to hear you fellows discuss religion   tom bently  observed   you wander round the subject as aimlessly as the young women  in the first half hour of a harvard symphony concert       never you mind  bently   rejoined ainsworth   you are sure of coming  out all right  the gods are bound to protect humbug  for on it depends  their own existence      they drifted in little groups to different parts of the studio   admiring this or that bit of grace or beauty  then the german  who was  a professional musician  tuned an old mandolin with which a venetian  lover some star lit night centuries ago  may have serenaded his loved  one from his gondola  and to its trembling accompaniment sang a quaint  chansonette  his teutonic accent making havoc among its liquid italian  syllables  then rangely possessed himself of a strange african  instrument  a crooked gourd  hollowed and strung with twisted tree  fibers  and joined to the notes of the mandolin  its weird  cicada like  harshness  the duet moved bently to clear a miscellaneous collection of  articles from the lid of a spinnet of the time of louis xiv   upon  which be powdered and be patched dames  long forgotten  had strummed  pretty little tinkling tunes  while all about them other  marionette like ladies and gallants played at little tinkling loves  as  pretty and as empty     the three instruments  so strangely matched  went off together in a  variety of music  imparting to every thing an uncanny  ghostly flavor   as if these airs came in wild echoes from the shores of some dead past      oh  stop that   herman cried  at last   it s too melancholy  your  instruments are all dead  and it s no use trying to get live music out  of them      for reply the german led off in a drearisome minor folk tune  rangely  and bently improvising their parts with some skill  albeit not always  with perfect harmony      ye gods   cried ainsworth  seizing the mandolin out of the player s  grasp   is this a hottentot funeral  here  fred  give me that  diabolical gourd  it is haunted by the soul of a caffre medicine man       i say  fellows   spoke rangely  as the din subsided   i move we make  this a funeral  by breaking up the pagans  of course there is nothing  to hinder our meeting round at each other s places whenever we want to   but we ve either got to turn fenton out or break up  i  for one  am  coward enough to prefer to break up       so say i   said herman   when once a circle like this is broken  there  is an end of it  it can t be patched together      they looked at each other in silence a moment  to disband seemed like  an acknowledgment of defeat  many another band of ardent souls has  known the feeling  with its dreary ache  although it oftener happens  that a circle of this kind disappears by the gradual dropping away of  its numbers one by one rather than that its members are brought face to  face with the necessity of owning that its existence had resulted in  failure  whatever their faults and extravagances  whatever their errors  and intolerance  they were sincere  self sacrificing and ardent beyond  the men who made up the world about them  a group of eager lovers of  truth and art who had been drawn together by mutual aims and  enthusiasms  their fierceness had been in defense of honesty and  sincerity  their disinterestedness was attested by the fact that any  one of them might have made his peace with philistia and been rewarded  for his complaisance had he so chosen  doubtless they had their faults  and foibles  yet their comradeship  in its essential purport had been  true and noble     they in no wise abandoned their aims in agreeing with the proposition  to disband  but about their fellowship had been a certain un phrased  tenderness  at which  if put in word  any one of them might have  scoffed  yet which nevertheless they all felt strongly in their secret  hearts  and all were conscious that after this defection of fenton  the  circle could never be perfect again  they did not discuss the matter  now  but in the interval of silence each acknowledged to himself that  to disband was best  and briefly each gave his assent  all soberly   some almost gruffly     and so it came about that the goddess pasht lost her last band of  followers  and the pagans assembled no more forever           xxxvi     as false as stairs of sand      merchant of venice  v            very likely you cannot see it   arthur fenton said  striking in the  background of a portrait with vicious roughness   women and brutes  differ from men in lacking reason  if you were logical you d see       see that you are right in selling your convictions for patronage    helen returned gravely  ignoring the insult   then i am glad i am not  logical       if you choose to put it that way   he retorted doggedly   i must still  say yes      it was friday morning  and helen was to sail the next day  she had come  to fenton s studio to bid him good by  knowing that they should have  that to say which could not be freely spoken before edith  and yet not  choosing to have him come to her own house without his wife      poverty   he went on aggressively   is nature s protest against  civilization  and still more against art  i am bound to fight nature on  her own ground  am i not       if i were a little more orthodox   she replied   i might quote  scripture upon life s being some thing more than meat  oh  arthur  what  is the use of all this fencing  all that is asked of you is to be  honest  and to be honest the life of an artist in america to day must  be a protest against dominant philistinism  nobody has ever  acknowledged that oftener or more emphatically than you have       but the artists   returned he  not meeting her eyes   are too  self centered  look at the pagans  what efforts have they ever made to  win society  society is ready enough to take them in       arthur  is it you who say that  to quote yourself against yourself    every work of art is an effort to conquer philistinism   patronage  seems already to have sucked the life out of you       you may say what you like   fenton remarked defensively   you cannot  make me angry       that may be your misfortune   rejoined she sadly   but i fear it is  your fault       the sin of a thing   he said  putting down his brushes impatiently    oftener consists in regarding it as a sin than in the thing itself      he went to the round window  for his studio was high up in the  building  and removed the japanese umbrella which served as its screen   he threw himself upon a pile of cushions  regarding darkly the tops of  the trees in the old granary burying ground opposite       que voulez vous    he demanded coolly  after a moment s silence    you are unreasonable  you always are  i must live  i don t know why  you have a right to object to that  i have married a wife who is well  connected  and i always meant to make her connections help me   philistines or not  even the godly israelites made a virtue of spoiling  the egyptians       but that was in departing from their country       we won t argue   the artist declared sulkily   argument is only  disputing about definitions  and we should never agree  i don t expect  you to think i m right  as a matter of fact i have my doubts myself   you might at least allow me the satisfaction of humbugging myself if i  am able      she regarded him sadly  the chance remarks about edith s relatives  seemed to throw a new and sinister light upon the reasons of his  marriage  she wondered if she had not been mistaken in following her  impulse to come here  and whether words could effect any thing      but edith   she said at length  and as if half to herself   does not  her honesty rebuke you  don t you feel unworthy of her       well  and if her severe virtue does repel me   he asked  a hard look  coming into his face   am i to blame for that also       you are speaking of your wife        c est vrai   with a shrug   but the one lie i never tell to or  of any woman is that my passion for her will be eternal  and i am long  ago tired of edith  her innocence bores me  she urges me  too  to do  precisely the things you condemn  and after all what is my crime   simply that i am following the intelligence of the majority instead of  being governed by the growls of the discontented minority  any one of  whom would be glad of the chance to follow my example       it is not with whom you side   helen answered   it is the simple  question of having the courage of your convictions  the dry rot of  hypocrisy is ruining you  i can see peter calvin s smirk in every brush  mark of your canvas there      for reply he threw a brush at the picture upon the easel  then he sat  upright in his cushions and faced her      well   he ejaculated  half angrily  half bitterly   you are right  you  cannot scorn me half as much as i scorn myself  and have ever since i  asked edith caldwell to marry me  i meant then to make my peace with  the philistines      he sprang to his feet impetuously and shook himself as if to shake off  some disgusting touch      i like a comfortable home at the west end   he continued impetuously    far better than i do dreary bachelor lodgings  now here  now there  i  prefer faring sumptuously every day  to dining in an attic  whatever  else may be said of that terrible calvin  my god  helen  how i would  like to choke him   he certainly has plenty of money  and he patronizes  me beautifully      he walked up to the easel and regarded the half finished portrait  contemptuously      honesty   he began again with cool irony   is doubtless a charming  thing for digestive purposes  but it is a luxury too expensive for me   the gods in this country bid for shams  and shams i purpose giving  them  i am not sure i shall not go into chromos eventually  i don t  enjoy this especially  but after all that is a mere matter of  standards  and i have resolved to change mine  so that i shall end by  enjoying or even honoring my eminently respectable self  as for art   she is a jade that can t give her lovers even a fire to sit by while  they woo her  i m sorry for her  but i don t see clearly how i can help  her by sitting down to starve in her company  so i ve made friends with  the mammon of unrighteousness  you see my orthodox education was not  wholly lost upon me   voila tout   honesty  i say  is for the most  part cant  and at any rate only a relative term  i prefer substantial  good  if you despise me   tant pis pour   one of us  whichever you  choose      he spoke defiantly  but faltered a little at the last words  she rose  as he finished      good by   she said   you have taught me forever to distrust my own  judgments  for i had mistaken you for a man  i am sorry that i have  ever known you  you lower my respect for all the race       but i acknowledge my faults       acknowledge   she retorted in disdain   what of that  acknowledgment  is not reparation  though many try to make it so      she walked towards the door  but he reached it first and laid his hand  upon the latch      you are going away   he said   who knows when we shall ever meet  again  at least remember that i condemn myself as sharply as you can       that is the degradation of it   was her retort  her eyes blazing at  him   if you could plead ignorance  i could pity you       edith is a saint   he went on  not heeding   but her good is my evil   i do not plead it as an excuse  i have and i want no excuse  but it is  true that temptation could come to me in no shape so insidious as  through her sincerity       then you will be honest   pleaded helen      i do not say that  i think i shall go on as i am  but i have changed  my idea of my epitaph  it shall be only the word  pardon        your old one was better   she retorted stingingly   and better than  either would be a blank  let me pass            xxxvii     farewell at once  for once  for all and ever                              richard ii   ii           the outward bound steamer was almost ready to sail  and all the bustle  attendant upon departure of an ocean craft eddied about three people  who stood in a half sheltered nook upon the wharf  they were saying  little  both grant herman and ninitta kept their eyes fixed upon helen   while her glance was cast to the ground  save when she raised her head  in speaking     the italian from time to time took helen s hand in hers and kissed it  fondly      i pray the madonna for you every night   she whispered in her native  tongue   that she will give you a safe voyage      the sculptor watched all that went on about them  waiting with some  inward impatience for the moment when the duty of escorting mrs   greyson on board would give him an opportunity of being a moment alone  with her      we shall miss you much   he said  feeling that any thing would be  better than the silence which hedged them in amid the noisy bustle of  the throng   we shall not soon fill your place  shall we  ninitta      he did not listen to the eager answer  his eyes were fixed upon helen s  face  and for her alone he had ears      yes   he said again with nervous platitude  when once more they had  lapsed into the silence he found it so hard to bear   neither my wife  nor myself has any friend to take your place      some faint accent in the tone in which he referred to his three hours   bride made the widow look up suddenly  to the question in her eyes his  glance gave no answer  and for the moment a feeling of despair overcame  her  had she given him up only to the end that his life should be  miserable  had she forced him into a marriage whose bonds would gall  and chafe him with more deadly and festering wounds as time went on     but all these questionings helen had answered with stern bravery during  the sad wakeful nights and lonely days just past  she had first  convinced herself that it was right that herman should redeem his  old time pledge to ninitta  and after that she forced herself to the  bitterer task of realizing that when time had obliterated somewhat the  clearness of her own image in the sculptor s heart  something of his  old affection for the italian might be rekindled in his generous  warm  nature  always tenderly chivalrous towards woman  and sure to prove  doubly so to one dependent upon him  it was hard  but helen  unflinchingly analyzed the nature of her lover  and while she could not  believe that he would ever feel for his wife the grand passion which  she had herself inspired in his breast  she saw for him a tranquil  future in which his wife s devotion would be met with enduring  even  with increasing affection  which if not love  would be so like it that  ninitta  at least  would never distinguish  and in which her husband  would find comfort and warmth  if not fire and aspiration     she had a harder struggle when the thought came to her   have i not led  him into the one thing he most dreads and despises  an act of  insincerity  can a loveless marriage be honest   but she answered her  doubting heart   no  he has told ninitta that he does not love her as  of old  and he is not deceiving her  it is my own selfishness that puts  this thought into my mind   it may be that helen was wrong  for the  influence of her puritan training had left a strong impress upon her  moral sense in a regard for the sanctity of a pledge  especially to its  spirit rather than its letter  so deep as to be almost morbid  yet at  least she was self sacrificing and never more truly consistent than in  the seeming inconsistency of urging this marriage      come   was herman s word  almost a command  when the crowd upon the  steamer s deck began definitely to separate into those who were to go  and those who remained   you must go aboard  ninitta  stand just where  you are until i come back  i will be gone only an instant      helen turned and kissed ninitta  a sharp pang stabbing her very soul   as the thought came to her   he will love her  she is his wife  and he  will learn to love her   then she put her arm upon herman s in silence     she had been alternately desiring and fearing this moment  until her  excitement was almost beyond control  the sculptor led her on board the  steamer  and together they descended to the saloon  every body was on  deck except the servants  and without difficulty a nook was found where  the two were alone      well   he said  breaking the silence with a voice full of emotion   it  is done  and we are parted as far as the earth is wide       no   she answered  clasping his hands in hers   with a broken faith  between us we should have been separated  now we are truly together  no  matter how many oceans part us  it is hard  it is hard  but i know it  must be right      he bent forward to kiss her      no   she said  drawing back   your kisses belong to your wife  now  i  have no right even to your thought  but i cannot help telling you  now  we are parting  how much it is to me to love you  it is hard to leave  you  grant  to give you up  but now i understand that it is better to  love  even if we are not together  even though we may not belong to  each other  and i cannot but find comfort in thinking that you will not  forget me       but if hereafter   he began eagerly  but before the words were uttered  he realized what they implied  and a hot flush of shame tinged his  cheek   no   he said   i cannot think of the future      she put up her hand with a gesture of appeal  the bell of the steamer  sounded out sharply upon the air      no   she said   we must say good by with no reservations  no hopes   even with no prayers  it is simply and absolutely good by  and oh   she  added  her voice breaking a little   i do so hope for your happiness   though i must not share it      he wrung her hand and left her  once he halted  as if to return  but  her gesture gave him so absolute a farewell that he went on  his wife  awaited him where he had left her  she slipped her arm through his      i am so glad you have come back   she said in her soft italian   lifting to his a face full of trust and love   i was so lonely and  afraid without you      he was touched with a tender pity as he looked into her eyes  when he  withdrew his glance the steamer was moving  and he saw helen leaning  over the rail  she waved her hand  and as the ship glided away  down  the harbor  these two  so separated  yet so united  clung together by  their glances until distance shut them from each other s sight     finis                       the  shaher   mission premises in orogmiah

meadows and  fruitful fields delight the eye  its ripening harvests make us feel as  if we too were wealthy  but while the view of what lies before us is so  pleasant  our joy is greater if we can remember when it was all a  wilderness  and contrast its present beauty with the roughness of its  former state     so  in viewing the wonders of divine grace  we need to see its results  in connection with what has been  we can appreciate the loveliness of  the child of god only as we compare him with the child of wrath he was  before  paul not only recounts the great things which god had done for  the early disciples  but bids them remember that they were once without  christ  and before he tells them that god had made them  sit together  in heavenly places in christ jesus   he reminds them that they had   walked according to the spirit that now worketh in the children of  disobedience      in seeking  then  to set forth the great things which god has done for  woman in persia  let us first look on her as his gospel found her  that  we may better appreciate the grace which wrought the change     we can understand the condition of woman in that empire only as we bear  in mind that its government is despotic  and that no constitutional  safeguards shield the subjects of a thoroughly selfish and profligate  nobility  the nestorians  too  are marked out alike by religion and  nationality as victims of oppression  however great their wrongs  they  can hope for little redress  for a distant court shares in the plunder  taken from them  and believes its own officials rather than the  despised rayahs  whom they oppress  even when foreign intervention  procures some edict in their favor  these same officials  in distant  oroomiah  are at no loss to evade its demands     the nestorian is not allowed a place in the bazaar     he cannot engage  in commerce  and in the mechanic arts  he cannot aspire higher than the  position of a mason or carpenter  which  of course  is not to be  compared to the standing of the same trades among us  when our  missionaries went to oroomiah  a decent garment on a nestorian was safe  only as it had an outer covering of rags to hide it   footnote    the  bazaar is  literally  the market  but denotes the business part of a  city      in their language  as in arabic  the missionaries found no word for   home   and there was no need of it  for the thing itself was wanting   the house consisted of one large room and was generally occupied by  several generations  in that one room all the work of the family was  performed  there they ate  and there they slept  the beds consisted of  three articles  a thick comfortable filled with wool or cotton beneath   a pillow  and one heavy quilt for covering  on rising  they  took up  their beds   and piled them on a wooden frame  and spread them down  again at night  the room was lighted by an opening in the roof  which  also served for a chimney  though  of course  in a very imperfect  manner  as the inside of every dwelling that has stood for any length  of time bears witness  the upper part of the walls and the under  surface of the roof  we can hardly call it ceiling  fairly glitter  as  though they had been painted black and varnished  and every article of  clothing  book  or household utensil  is saturated with the smell of  creosote  the floor  like the walls  is of earth  covered in part with  coarse straw mats and pieces of carpeting  and the flat roof  of the  same material  rests on a layer of sticks  supported by large beams   the mass above  however  often sifts through  and sometimes during a  heavy rain assumes the form of a shower of mud  bad as all this may  seem  the houses are still worse in the mountain districts  such as  gawar  there they are half under ground  made of cobble stones laid up  against the slanting sides of the excavation  and covered by a conical  roof with a hole in the centre  they contain  besides the family  all  the implements of husbandry  the cattle  and the flocks  these last  occupy  the sides of the house     sam  xxiv      and stand facing the   decana   or raised place in the centre  which is devoted to the  family  as wood is scarce in the mountains  and the climate severe  the  animal heat of the cattle is a substitute for fuel  except as sun baked  cakes of manure are used once a day for cooking  as is the practice  also on the plain  in such houses the buffaloes sometimes break loose  and fight furiously  and instances are not rare when they knock down  the posts on which the roof rests  and thus bury all in one common ruin     the influence of such family arrangements  even in the more favored  villages of the plain  on manners and morality  need not be told  it is  equally evident that in such circumstances personal tidiness is  impossible  though few in our favored land have any idea of the extent  of such untidiness  if the truth must be told  vermin abound in most of  these houses  the inmates are covered not only with fleas  but from  head to foot they are infested with the third plague of egypt   ex   viii          this last is a constant annoyance in many parts of turkey  as well as persia  if one lodges in the native houses  there is no  refuge from them  and only an entire change of clothing affords relief  when he returns to his own home  even there the divans have to be  sedulously examined after the departure of visitors  that the plague do  not spread  the writer has known daughters of new england  ready for  almost any self denial  burst into tears when first brought into  contact with this     at first  the teachers of the female seminary in oroomiah had to  cleanse their pupils very thoroughly  and were glad thus to purify the  outside  while beseeching christ to cleanse the heart  each one  on her  first arrival  had to be separately cared for  lest the enemy should  recover ground from which he had already been driven with much labor   missionary publications do not usually tell of such trials  but those  who drew the lambs from the deep pit  loved them all the more tenderly  for having gone down into it themselves  that thence they might bring  them to jesus  such trials are less common now  for it is generally  understood that a degree of personal cleanliness is an indispensable  requisite for admission to the seminary  but such a demand  at that  time  would have rendered the commencement of the school impossible     the pupils became much improved in personal appearance  and some of  their simple hearted mothers really thought their children had grown  very pretty under their teachers  care  so  as many of them were  strangers to the cleansing properties of water  they would ask again  and again   how do you make them so white      but if such houses were comfortless abodes for those in health  what  were they for the sick  think of one in a burning fever  perhaps  delirious  lying in such a crowd  in winter  there they must remain   for there is no other place  and in summer  they are often laid under a  tree in the day time  and carried up to the flat roof  with the rest of  the family  at night     dr  perkins  in the early part of his missionary life  tells us that in  a village the family room was given up to him for the night  and in the  morning he found a little son had been born in the stable  he supposed  that he had been the unwitting cause of such an event occurring there   but longer acquaintance with the people shows that woman almost  invariably resorts to that place in her hour of sorrow  and there she  often dies  the number who meet death in this form is very large     in persia  as in other unevangelized countries  women spend their days  in out door labor  they weed the cotton  and assist in pruning the  vines and gathering the grapes  they go forth in the morning  bearing  not only their implements of husbandry  but also their babes in the  cradle  and returning in the evening  they prepare their husband s  supper  and set it before him  but never think of eating themselves  till after he is done  one of the early objections the nestorians made  to the female seminary was  that it would disqualify their daughters  for their accustomed toil  in after years  woman might be seen carrying  her spelling book to the field  along with her persian hoe  little  dreaming that she was thus taking the first step towards the  substitution of the new implement for the old     nestorian parents used to consider the birth of a daughter a great  calamity  when asked the number of their children  they would count up  their sons  and make no mention of their daughters  the birth of a son  was an occasion for great joy and giving of gifts  neighbors hastened  to congratulate the happy father  but days might elapse before the  neighborhood knew of the birth of a daughter  it was deemed highly  improper to inquire after the health of a wife  and the nearest  approach to it was to ask after the welfare of the house or household   formerly  a man never called his wife by name  but in speaking of her  would say   the mother of so and so   giving the name of her child  or    the daughter of so and so   giving the name of her father  or  simply   that woman  did this or that  nor did the wife presume to call her  husband s name  or to address him in the presence of his parents  who   it will be borne in mind  lived in the same apartment  they were  married very young  often at the age of fourteen  and without any  consultation of their own preference  either as to time or person     there was hardly a man among the nestorians who did not beat his wife   the women expected to be beaten  and took it as a matter of course  as  the wife lived with the husband s father  it was not uncommon for him  to beat both son and daughter in law  when the men wished to talk  together of any thing important  they usually sent the women out of  doors or to the stable  as unable to understand  or unfit to be  trusted  in some cases  this might be a necessary precaution  for the  absence of true affection  and the frequency of domestic broils   rendered the wife an unsafe depositary of any important family affair   the same causes often led the wife to appropriate to her own foolish  gratification any money of her husband she could lay hands on   regardless of family necessities  women whose tastes led them to load  themselves with beads  silver  baser metal  and rude trinkets  would  not be likely to expend money very judiciously     in       the only nestorian woman that knew how to read was heleneh   the sister of mar shimon  and when others were asked if they would not  like to learn  with a significant shrug they would reply   i am a  woman   they had themselves no more desire to learn than the men had to  have them taught  indeed  the very idea of a woman reading was regarded  as an infringement of female modesty and propriety     it is a little curious  and shows how we adapt ourselves to our  situation  that the women were as unwilling to receive attention from  their husbands as they were to render it  several years after the  arrival of miss fiske in oroomiah  the wife of one of her assistants  visited the seminary  and on leaving to return to her village  the  teacher  in the kindness of her heart  proposed to the husband to go  and assist her to carry the child  she seemed as if she had been  insulted in being thought unable to carry it  and sent her husband back  from the door in any thing but a gracious mood  leaving the good  teacher half bewildered and half amused at this reception of her  intended kindness     indeed  until some of them were converted  all that was lovely and of  good report in woman was entirely wanting  they were trodden down  but  at the same time exceedingly defiant and imperious  if they were not  the  head   it was not because they did not  strive for the mastery    they seemed to have no idea of self control  their bursts of passion  were awful  the number of women who reverenced their husbands was as  small as the list of husbands who did not beat their wives  says miss  fiske  in writing to a friend   i felt pity for my poor sisters before  going among them  but anguish when  from actual contact with them  i  realized how very low they were  i did not want to leave them  but i  did ask  can the image of christ ever be reflected from such hearts   they would come and tell me their troubles  and fall down at my feet   begging me to deliver them from their husbands  they would say   you  are sent by our holy mother  mary  to help us   and do not think me  hard hearted when i tell you that i often said to them   loose your  hold of my feet  i did not come to deliver you from your husbands  but  to show you how to be so good that you can be happy with them    weeping  they would say   have mercy on us  if not  we must kill  ourselves   i had no fear of their doing that  so i would seat them at  my side  and tell them of my own dear father   how good he was  but he  was always  obeyed   they would say   we could obey a good man    but i  am very sure you would not have been willing to obey my father       it is one thing to pray for our degraded sisters while in america  but  quite another to raise them from their low estate  when i saw their  true character  i found that i needed a purer  holier love for them  than i had ever possessed  it was good for me to see that  i  could do  nothing  and it was comforting to think that jesus had talked with just  such females as composed the mass around me  and that afterwards many  believed because of one such woman      sometimes the revilings of the women were almost equalled by similar  talk among the men  as in a village of gawar  where they said   we  would not receive a priest or deacon here who could not swear well  and  lie too   in the same village  a young man spoke favorably of mr   coan s preaching in jeloo  instantly a woman called out   and have you  heard those deceivers preach    yes   was the reply   both last year  and this  and hope i shall again   hearing this  her eyes flashed  and  drawing her brawny arms into the form of a dagger  with a vengeful  thrust of her imaginary weapon  she cried   the blood of thy father  smite thee  thou satan   and dreadful was the volley of oaths and  curses that followed  yet she was only a fair specimen of the village     we of the calmer west do not know what it is to have a mob of such  women come forth in their wrath  in one town was a virago  who often   single handed  faced down and drove off moslem tax gatherers when the  men fled in terror  no one who has ever heard the stinging shrillness  of their tongues  or looked on their frenzied gestures  can ever forget  them  or wonder why the ancients painted the furies in the form of  women  words cannot portray the excitement of such a scene  the hair of  the frantic actors is streaming in the wind  stones and clods seem only  embodiments of the unearthly yells and shrieks that fill the air  and  yet it was such beings that grace made to be  last at the cross and  first at the sepulchre      the east is notorious for profanity  and among the nestorians women  were as profane as men  the pupils in the seminary at first used to  swear  and use the vilest language on the slightest provocation  poor   blind martha  on her death bed  in her own father s house  was  constantly cursed and reviled  she was obliged sometimes to cover her  head with the quilt  and stop her ears  to secure an opportunity to  pray for her profane and abusive brother  and though  in such  circumstances  she died before her prayers were answered  yet they were  heard  for he afterwards learned to serve his sister s god   do you  think people will believe me   said a pupil to her teacher  who was  reproving her for profanity   if i do not repeat the name of god very  often      lying was almost as common as profanity  and stealing quite as  prevalent as either  it was a frequent remark   we all lie here  do you  think we could succeed in business without it      in the early days of the seminary  nothing was safe except under lock  and key  sometimes there seemed to be a dawn of improvement  and next   all the buttons would be missing from the week s washing  and the  teacher was pretty sure to find that her own pupils were the thieves   miss rice tells of one  amply supplied with every thing by her parents   yet noted for her thefts  indeed  sons and daughters were alike trained  to such practices  in       miss fiske could not keep a pin in her  pin cushion  little fingers took them as often as she turned away  and  lest she should tempt them to lie  she avoided questioning them  unless  her own eye had seen the theft  no wonder she wrote   i feel very weak   and were it not that christ has loved these souls  i should be  discouraged  but he has loved them  and he loves them still   if the  pins were found with the pupils  the answer was ready   we found them    or   you gave them to us   and nothing could be proved  but one summer  evening  just before the pupils were to pass through her room to their  beds on the flat roof  knowing that none of that color could be  obtained elsewhere  the teacher put six black pins in her cushion  and  stepped out till they had passed  as soon as they were gone  she found  the pins gone too  and at once called them back  she told them of her  loss  but none knew any thing about it  she showed them that no one  else had been there  and therefore they must know  six pairs of little  hands were lifted up  as they said   god knows we have not got them    but this only called forth the reply   i think that god knows you have  got them   and she searched each one carefully  without finding them   she then proposed to kneel down where they stood  and ask god to show  where they were  adding   he may not see it best to show me now  but he  will do it some time   she laid the matter before the lord  and  just  as they rose from their knees  remembered that she had not examined  their cloth caps  she now proposed to examine them  and one pair of  hands went right up to her cap  of course she was searched first  and  there were the six pins  so nicely concealed in its folds that nothing  was visible but their heads  this incident did much good  the pupils  looked on the discovery as an answer to prayer  and so did their  teacher  they began to be afraid to steal when god so exposed their  thefts  and she was thankful for an answer so immediate  the offender  is now a pious  useful woman     yet some were so accustomed to falsehood  that  even after conversion   it cost a struggle to be entirely truthful  and missionaries could see   as christians in our own land cannot see  why an apostle should write  to the regenerate   lie not one to another   the teacher labored to  impress her charge with the sinfulness of such conduct  but in the  revival of       they seemed to learn more in one hour than she had  taught them in the two years preceding  yet that faithful instruction  was not lost  it was the fuel which the spirit of god kindled into a  flame  the sower has not labored in vain because the seed lies for days  buried in the soil     in that revival  the awakened hastened to restore what they had stolen   one came to miss fiske in great distress  saying   do you remember the  day  two years ago  when sawdee s new shoes were taken from the  door    they leave off their shoes on entering a house    yes  i  recollect it    you thought a moslem woman stole them  but   and here  her feelings overcame her   i took them  for i was angry with her  and  threw them into a well  what shall i do  i know christ will not receive  me till i have confessed it to her  can i go and confess it to night   and pray with her  and then may i go and work for money to replace  them   she paid for the shoes  and became a bright light in her dark  home  there were many such cases  and from that time the teachers had  little trouble from theft  new pupils would sometimes steal  but the  older ones were ready to detect them  and show them a more excellent  way  miss fiske says of this   the frequent visits of the holy spirit  have removed an evil which mocked my efforts  god made me feel my utter  helplessness  and then he did the work   that same term there was but  one case of theft in the male seminary  though formerly it was not  infrequent there     in reference to transgressions of the seventh commandment  much detail  is not expedient  it is sufficient to say  that the first impressions  of earlier missionaries respecting the purity of nestorian women were  not sustained by subsequent acquaintance  the farther they went beneath  the surface of things  the more they found of corruption  one might go  to persia supposing that he knew a good deal of the degradation of the  people  and yet really know very little of the pit into which he was  descending     a seminary gathering together such a company of young females  was a  new thing in persia  and it will readily be conceived that amid a  mohammedan community it was an object of peculiar solicitude to its  guardians  many a moslem eye was on those girls  as the results of a  religious education appeared in their manners  their dress  and  personal beauty  in one instance  an officer of government attempted to  take one of them to his harem  but god thwarted his purpose through the  interference of the english consul  similar dangers threatened from  other sources  and eternity alone will reveal the burden of care and  watchfulness they involved  if only one pupil had been led astray  what  a hopeless loss of confidence would have followed among the people  in  the early years of the institution  when parents could hardly be  persuaded to trust their daughters out of their sight for a single  night  it might have broken up the whole enterprise  but in this  matter  also  god showed himself the hearer of prayer  and not one  danger of the kind was ever allowed to be more than an occasion for  renewed intercession  and more confiding dependence on his gracious  care  sometimes  in vacation  it seemed strange to its guardians that  they had no longer a fold to protect  and could retire to rest free  from that anxious solicitude that sometimes drove sleep from their eyes     it is not in the beginning of missionary life that all these things are  understood  they are learned gradually  this is wisely ordered  that  the missionary be not discouraged at the outset  strength is given each  day to meet new trials as they come  and it would not be leaving a  truthful impression on the reader  if  at the close of this description  of what has been  it should not be recorded  to the praise of divine  grace  that a great change has taken place  there are many to day to  whom the missionary may say   such were some of you  but ye are washed   but ye are sanctified  but ye are justified in the name of the lord  jesus  and by the spirit of our god   not only do some who stole steal  no more  but many young husbands now provide separate apartments for  the bride whom they bring home  and they need all that the word  home   expresses to describe their mutual joy  the hour of suffering is  anticipated by a considerate affection  and that affection is so  reciprocated that many hearts safely trust in the daughters of the  female seminary of oroomiah     it is not merely education that has wrought this change  but a bible  education  paul cared for just such converts  and left divine teachings  for the use of those who should come after him in the same work  as a  young wife said to her teacher one day  after she had been talking with  her about her new duties   i thank you  you are right  i am glad that  you have told me what paul says  and i think that god has told you the  same thing   many a graduate might say  with another   i thank you for  your instructions  and as i look on the trials of ungodly families   every drop of my blood thanks you            chapter ii       marbeeshoo     visit there   native accommodations   hospitality of senum   mohammedan  women     the following account of miss fiske s visit to marbeeshoo  in november         presents a vivid picture of things as they were  and the  christian thoughtfulness of one who had learned a more excellent way        as we sat at dinner a few days since  mr  stocking proposed that i  spend the sabbath with him at marbeeshoo  i said at once   i cannot  leave my school   but he forthwith called sanum  sarah  and moressa  my  oldest girls  and asked them if they did not love souls in marbeeshoo  well enough to take good care of school  and let me be absent till  tuesday  they were delighted to think of my going where no missionary  lady had ever been  and said   we will do all we can for the girls  and  we will pray for you  if you will only go and try to do those poor  women good   it was hardly two o clock before we were on horseback   marbeeshoo is about fifty miles from us  and in turkey  two years ago  it was said  no lady should try to go there   but brother stocking  thought not so now  and i was willing to follow where he led   especially as a former pupil had recently settled there  we must be out  over night  but we thought best not to spend it in a tent  on account  of the cold  near sunset we came to mawana  a village of mud huts  we  went to the house of the head man  who joyfully welcomed us to his  house  it consisted of a single low room  inhabited by at least a score  of men  women  and children  they came in one by one  but already the  hens had found their resting place  evidently no strangers there   several lambs had been brought into their corner  and three or four  calves  each had his couch of grass  our horses had been arranged for  the night on the other side of a partition wall  some three feet high   when all were within  the coarse bread and sour milk were brought out  for supper  then mr  stocking read from the bible  and talked  and  prayed with the numerous family  and the women sat around me  while i  tried to do them good  till about ten o clock  at that time  the mother  of the family rose  saying   now we will settle it   i listened to hear  the settlement of some family quarrel  but to my surprise her meaning  was   we will settle where to lie down for the night   and as i looked  over the room i thought  surely some little skill in settling is  needed  if we are all to sleep here  but soon she took out three of the  children to an empty manger  where she put new hay  and quickly settled  them  they were covered with an old rug  and at once fell fast asleep   she then returned  saying   now there is room for our guests   and  brought a piece of cotton cloth  which she said was  all  for me  in a  short time  one and another was fast asleep  they lay on mats  without  either bed or pillow  and the divers breathing or snoring of men  and  calves  and lambs was soon heard  all mingled together      i found myself sitting alone with the old lady  and so  putting my  carpet bag under my head  and drawing my shawl about me  i lay down  too  this was a signal for extinguishing the light  but before that  i  had marked a road  where i thought i might possibly pass out between  the sleepers should i need fresh air  there was no sleep for me  and  the swarms of fleas made me so uncomfortable  that before midnight i  found my way out  and remained as long as the cold air of that november  night allowed  and so passed out and in several times during the night   i watched long for the morning  and at length it came  and the  sleepers  one by one  arose  they all hoped i had slept well  and i  could not tell them i had not  for they had given me the best they had   and told me again and again how glad they were that i had come  and  hoped their house would always be mine when i came that way  there was  a proposal for breakfast  but the morning was so fine that i suggested  to mr  stocking that a carpet bag sometimes furnished a very good  breakfast      we did enjoy that ride very much after a sleepless night  the road was  often only a narrow path on the edge of a precipice  and such as i had  never passed over before  but i thanked my god at every step for the  pure  fresh air of those mountains  as we approached the village  hid  away among the cliffs  and in such a narrow spot that houses were  placed one above another on the terraced hill side  one of our  attendants insisted on riding forward  and we were not greatly  surprised to find a crowd ready to welcome us  one and another cried  out   senum wants you to go to zechariah s   so to zechariah s we went   and there was my pupil  waiting with open arms to receive me  she took  me from my horse  exclaiming   is it true that you have come  i have  heard where you staid last night  and i know you did not sleep at all   come right into my room  there are no fleas here  i have a bed that is  clean  that i keep for the missionaries  i will spread it for you  and  you shall sleep before any body comes to see you   the bed was spread   she gave me milk to drink  judg  iv       and then said   i will guard  the door so no one shall disturb you  and i will wake you for dinner    i was soon asleep  and slept two long hours before she woke me      when she did  she came with her tray in her hand  where was the  freshly baked bread  the nicely cooked little fish  which  she said    my husband caught expressly for you and mr  stocking   honey from  their own hives  milk from their flock  and other simple refreshments   all was neatly prepared  and we were so thankful for the dear child s  attentions  when dinner was over  she said   now i want you to see the  women  but they must not come here  for they will leave fleas  and you  will not be able to sleep tonight  there is another large room the  other side  and we will have meeting there this afternoon       about three o clock i met there more than one hundred poor women  who  of course must ask many questions before their curiosity would be  satisfied  they finally became quiet  however  and i could tell them of  the saviour  who had loved to teach just such needy ones as they were   i enjoyed the afternoon very much  it was all the more precious for the  discomforts of the night  and the comforts of senum s house  the next  day was the sabbath  and most of the time i was in the  large room    where the women came freely  in the afternoon about three hundred were  present  i was weary at night  but senum s care  with the thought of  the privilege of meeting so many who had never before heard of christ  as the  only  saviour  made me forget it all      painful as is this view of woman as she was among the nestorians  her  condition was still worse among the mohammedans  not  indeed  in  matters of outward comfort  for the wealth of persia is in moslem  hands  and they occupy every position of rank or authority in the land   but in all that pertains to morality and religion  they stand on a  lower level     the nestorian woman may not have known what was contained in the bible   yet she knew that it was the word of god  and was ready to receive all  its teachings as of divine authority  to her moslem sister it is not  only an unknown book  but one she is taught to regard as superseded by  the koran     although the nestorian woman knew nothing of spiritual worship  yet she  regarded the lord s day as set apart for his service  the moslem  on  the other hand  regards it like any other day of the week  and exalts  her friday to the place that of right belongs to the sabbath of the  lord     in all her degradation  the nestorian woman reverenced the name of  jesus as her god  true  she had no correct idea of salvation or  redeeming love  yet even a blind attachment to that sacred name is not  without its reward  she may have fallen very low  but there was a power  even in her ignorant adherence to christ  that kept her from falling to  the level of those who renounced him for the arabian impostor  this was  seen especially in the blessings that came to her through the  institution of christian marriage  while others groaned under the  debasing influence of a sensual polygamy  the wretchedness this  occasioned is a topic too large and too painful to dwell upon here  but  the wide gulf that separated the two classes was clearly seen  when on  her sabbath the missionary could speak to the nestorian of her saviour  out of her bible  while the moslem knows nothing beyond her kohl and  her henna     her dresses and her follies  and other topics at once  belittling  debasing  and corrupting   footnote    kohl is a black  powder used to paint the eyebrows and eyelashes  henna is a plant  employed to stain the nails  and sometimes the entire hand and part of  the foot  of a dark orange hue            chapter iii       the scene of the narrative     nestorians   their country   frontispiece   lake   plain   fording the  shaher   mission premises in oroomiah     we will now glance at the scene of the events to be narrated  as it may  not be familiar to every reader  to write of woman in persia would  embrace the whole empire as the field of inquiry  for the existence of  woman is coextensive with the population  but  woman and her saviour in  persia  confines our attention to those who have been taught the truth  as it is in jesus  for when christ sent forth paul to preach his gospel  to the gentiles  it was that they might receive forgiveness of sins   and inheritance among them who are sanctified by faith that is in him   and how shall they believe in him of whom they have not heard  our  theme  then  confines us to the nestorians  who number about one  hundred thousand souls  about two thirds of these live in turkey  but  the following pages relate principally to those residing in persia  and  hence the title of the volume     this people inhabit  along with koords and other races  the territory  extending from the western shore of the lake of oroomiah to the eastern  bank of the tigris  it includes the persian province of oroomiah  and  both the eastern and western slope of central koordistan  the most  inaccessible recesses of the koordish mountains have been their refuge  for centuries  the whole region extends across four degrees of  longitude  with a varying breadth of from one to two degrees of  latitude  attention will be called especially to the city of oroomiah  and the villages around it  the plain of that name is seventy five  miles long and from twelve to twenty miles in width  containing more  than a thousand square miles  it is dotted with perhaps three hundred  villages  the population varying  according to the size of the village   from less than one hundred to more than a thousand inhabitants     the frontispiece gives a view of this plain  from the roof of the  mission premises at seir  one thousand feet above the city  the lofty  wolf mountain appears on the right  and the high range west of the  narrowest part of the lake on the left  the lake itself is seen beyond  the plain at the foot of the mountains which rise abruptly from its  eastern shore  the distance makes it seem much narrower than it is  for  while one hundred miles in length  it is not far from thirty miles in  breadth  its surface is forty one hundred feet above the sea  and four  hundred feet below the city of oroomiah  no living thing exists in its  waters  which are both salt and bituminous     the plain is more crowded with villages than here represented  and each  one is made conspicuous by its grove of trees  as well as its houses   the city appears prominent at the foot of the hill  though six miles  distant from the spectator  it is in the same latitude with richmond   virginia  and contains about thirty five thousand souls  the plain  slopes up very gradually from the lake  and mount seir rises  behind  our point of view  two thousand eight hundred and thirty four feet  above the city  farther west  the summits of central koordistan rise   range above range  to the height of seventeen thousand feet     we pass down from seir to the city by a carriage road  now by the side  of vineyards  and now near fields of wheat and clover  diversified by  orchards and gardens of cucumbers  all of these  and indeed the whole  plain  owes its fertility to canals  led out from the rivers which  descend from the mountains  willow  poplar  and sycamore trees line  these watercourses  all kinds of fruit trees abound  while the rich  verdure of the plain contrasts strikingly with the bare declivities  that overlook it from every side  the villages on either hand are  clusters of mud houses crowded together for greater security  and every  tree in their groves has to be watered as regularly as the fields and  gardens     before reaching the city we must ford the shaher  a river that  though  frequently all drained off into the fields in summer  is very deep in  early spring  when fatal accidents sometimes occur  it was here that   in may        miss fiske narrowly escaped a watery grave  on her way to  seir  with mr  and mrs  stoddard  the horse lay down in the middle of  the river  leaving her to be swept off by the rapid current  mr   stoddard hastened to the rescue  but the moment his steed was loose  he  rushed to attack the horse of mrs  stoddard  and  as miss fiske rose to  the surface  she caught a glimpse of mr  stoddard looking back on the  battle  and his wife held between the combatants by her riding habit   which had caught on the saddle  but while she looked the dress gave  way  and mrs  stoddard was safe  she herself had sufficient presence of  mind not to breathe under water  and  on coming up for the fifth time   floated into shallow water near the opposite shore  forty rods below  the ford  just as mr  stoddard reached the same point     from the river  beautiful orchards line the road on both sides to the  city gate  of which a representation is given on page      and about  one eighth of a mile inside of that  where the nestorian and moslem  sections of the city join each other  stand the mission premises  built  of sun dried bricks  like the houses around them     they occupy a little more than an acre  in the form of a parallelogram   and if  for the sake of clearness  we compare it to a window  the  bottom of the lower sash is represented by a long  earthen roofed  structure  half of it a dwelling house  once the home of dr  grant  but  now the dwelling of dr  wright  it is the building on the left of the  engraving at page      and the round object occupying the nearest  window in the second story is a clock  the gift of a well known  merchant of boston  brother of one of our deceased missionaries  let  our lower sash be filled by two large panes in modern style  and these  are represented by two courts surrounded by pavements  and shaded by  large sycamore trees  in the engraving just referred to  the spectator  stands in one of these courts  looking over a low wall into the other   for the top of the lower sash  we have another building  extending  across the premises  the left half of this appearing on page       behind the trees  and on the opposite page represented without them   was the first home of dr  perkins  and is now the female seminary  but  repeated additions and modifications have been required to transform a  building  originally erected for a private residence  into a structure  suitable for such a school     miss fiske first taught in one room of a building to the right  which  does not appear in the engraving  though a part of it is seen on page       then  as the school grew larger  another room was added  and when  those quarters became too strait  this building was remodelled for its  use      illustration  female seminary at oboomiah     as we shall have a good deal to do with the seminary in these pages   let us become familiar with its home  between the central door and the  one on the left  those three windows belong to a large room once used  as a chapel  but since then as a guest room for the accommodation of  the women whom we shall see coming here to learn of jesus  in this  room  nestorian converts first partook of the lord s supper with the  missionaries  the left of the three windows directly over these  with  the rose bush in it  belongs to miss fiske s private room  and the  other two to her sitting room  this the pupils have named  the bethel    and it is so connected that the teacher can step into recitation room   dining room  or kitchen  as occasion requires  the last named apartment  is on the rear of the building  the largest recitation room  by a  curious necessity  is in the form of a carpenter s wooden square  with  the teacher s desk in the angle between the two compartments  one of  these is on the back side of the building  out of sight  the other   extending across the end  is represented in front by the window at the  extreme left     over the central door is  first  the steward s room  and then closets  over that  for one of the results of the successive alterations and  additions is  that parts of the building are two  and other parts  three  stories high  miss rice s room is directly over the door on the  left hand  as the steward s is here  the three windows in the second  story  to the right of the two central closets  open into the dining  room  and one of the girls  rooms occupies the corner beyond  on the  lower floor  going from the central door to the right  is first a  closet  and then a large guest room for visitors  and underneath the  whole is the cellar where the boys  school was first taught  that has  since grown into the male seminary at seir     the rooms of the pupils are mostly in the rear  these are large enough  to accommodate six or eight occupants  as the oriental style of living  does not require so much furniture as ours  in each room is a member of  the senior class  who exercises a kind supervision over her younger  companions  every room has two or more closets  designed especially   but not exclusively  for devotion  and some sleep in the recitation  rooms  as such a use of them at night does not interfere with other  uses during the day     but we had almost forgotten our imaginary window  the upper sash of  which remains to be described  in that we have only one pane   representing a large court  with the chapel on one side  and the wash  rooms and other outbuildings of the seminary on the other  this court  is more garden like than the other two  has fewer trees  and a long  arbor  covered with grape vines  forms a covered walk in the middle of  it  it was in this arbor that the tables were spread for the collation  in       to be described hereafter  this court is invaluable as a place  for out door exercise  where the pupils may enjoy the fresh air  free  from the annoyances and exposures of the streets in an oriental city     a stream is led through all these courts in a channel lined with stone   its murmuring waters are a pleasant sound at early dawn  when they  mingle sweetly with the morning song of birds  here many nestorian  women come to fill their earthen pitchers  as the water is not carried  through the courts of christian houses  the mission premises belonged  to mohammedans  and here  in the shade of the tall sycamores  mrs   grant used to sit  with her children  and talk with the women who came  for water  her successors find time to continue the same

the power of bible truth     the seminary is outwardly very humble  and would contrast very  unfavorably with the stately edifices of similar institutions at home   but we shall see that the saviour has not disdained to honor it with  his presence  and its earthen floors and mud walls    have witnessed  many a gracious visit of the holy spirit  though the glory of lebanon  has not come unto it  yet has god himself beautified the place and made  it glorious   footnote    the pilasters in the engraving are made of  brick  and not only support the large timbers of the roof  but  by  their

  missionary education     object  means  study of bible  pupils kept in sympathy with the  people   people stimulated to exertion and self dependence  tahiti     madagascar     let us now look at some of the principles on which missionary education  was here carried on  that we may see what kind of an instrumentality  god was pleased to crown with his blessing     the seminary was founded  not to polish the manners  refine the taste   or impart accomplishments  but to renovate the character by a permanent  inward change  the main dependence for bringing this about was the  power of the holy ghost  the only power that can impart or maintain  spiritual life in man  this dependence was expressed in fervent prayer   offered for years amid discouragement and opposition  and  instead of  ceasing when an answer came  only offered by a greater number  it is  worthy of note that some of the seasons of greatest revival were  preceded by disasters that threatened the very existence of the mission     the principal text book was the word of god  partly  as we shall see   through a providential necessity  but chiefly because it was god s own  chosen instrumentality for the salvation of our race  and it was  eminently adapted for the education of such a people  the teachers  could say  with a beloved co laborer on mount lebanon   to the  scriptures we give increased attention  they do more to unfold and  expand the intellectual powers  and to create careful and honest  thinkers  than all the sciences we teach   it is also most efficient in  freeing mind and heart from those erroneous views that are opposed to  its teachings  and actual trial developed a richness and fulness of  practical adaptation to the work that astonished even those who already  knew something of its value  its precepts and instructions were also  clothed with power  requirements and counsels which from the missionary  had only awakened opposition  coming from the bible were received as  messages from heaven  said a nestorian to a missionary who had been  speaking to him the words of god   his words grew very beautiful while  we were talking   in reference to every suspicious novelty or  distasteful duty  the bible was the ultimate appeal  the missionary  could say to them as paul did to an early church   when ye received the  word of god  which ye heard of us  ye received it not as the word of  man  but  as it is in truth  the word of god  which effectually worketh  also in you that believe   besides  those thus educated were to teach  others  and needed to be thoroughly furnished from the divine oracles  with the truths they were to impart  it is not strange  then  that in  the seminary the bible was studied both doctrinally and historically   that they had a system of theology and tables of scripture chronology   that biblical biography and geography were regular studies  that  different portions of scripture occupied different years  and that   instead of butler s analogy and wayland s moral science  were the  epistles to the romans and hebrews studied with all the accurate  analysis and thoroughness bestowed elsewhere upon the classics  such  teaching would yield good fruit any where  and the good seed found good  ground in persia     so much for the instrumentality  but  then  influences are every where  at work to check the growth of the plant of grace  and these must be  overcome  there is danger that missionary education may be made worse  than useless by allowing the sympathies of pupils to become alienated  from the masses around them  children from heathen families may be  puffed up with an idea of superiority to their own people  their taste  may be cultivated so as to render disgust with heathen degradation  stronger than the christian desire to do them good  a foreign language   foreign dress  and foreign habits may widen the gulf that separates  them from their people  till  what with an undue exaltation on the one  hand and a suspicious jealousy on the other  usefulness is well nigh  impossible  but here such tendencies have been carefully watched and  guarded against  the pupils have been trained with the view of doing  good among their own people  no line of separation has been drawn in  dress or diet  furniture or household arrangements  while taught to be  neat  the goal kept ever in sight has been  a happy usefulness in their  own homes  the elevation of the mass just as fast as was consistent  with mutual love and sympathy  the people not feeling that their  daughters were denationalized  and they not lifted out of sympathy with  the homes they were to bless  hence  even in       we find the mud  floor of the small school room covered with straw mats  one window  of  oiled paper  admitting the light  and a brick stove  with a few rude  benches  its only furniture  in the other room  where the cooking was  done  the pupils ate  and spent their time out of school  here were two  windows of like material  and besides the mats  the floor was covered  with a thick felt  on which they spread their beds at night  a table  was provided  covered with a coarse blue and white check  there were  also a set of coarse plates and a few other dishes  but no knives nor  forks  they eat their soup with wooden spoons  and their other food  with their hands  their clothing  like their cooking  was mostly in  native style  and they were taught to make it for themselves     another object in missionary education is  to do enough to stimulate to  exertion  and yet not foster inefficiency or undue dependence  the  nestorians are poor  but doing too much for them may make them still  poorer  they must be brought to sustain their own institutions at the  earliest possible moment  and their training should keep that end in  view  hence miss fiske writes   at first i was inclined to do more for  them than afterwards  and at length settled down on this principle   to  give my pupils nothing for common use which they could not secure in  their own homes by industry and economy  so i furnished only such  articles as they could buy in the city  i preferred that they should  make all their own clothing  and may have grieved friends sometimes by  declining clothing which they offered to send for them  we chose rather  to spend our own strength in training them to provide for themselves  i  do not mean that i am not glad to see foreign articles in oroomiah  but  we were in danger of fostering a more expensive taste than they would  have the means of gratifying  our great object is to raise up the most  efficient coadjutors from among the people  and they must labor among  their neighbors as of them  and not as foreigners  and be prepared to  carry forward the work when we leave it      at first we clothed as well as boarded our pupils  and then led them  to provide one article after another  till they clothed themselves  it  was delightful to see the interest parents began to take in clothing  their daughters  in order to send them to school after they provided  their own garments  they took better care of them  and so learned to  take better care of other things  since i left  miss rice has advanced  farther in this matter  and last year most of the pupils paid a trifle  for tuition  amounting in all to over twenty dollars  it often costs  more than the amount to secure these pittances  but it does our pupils  good  and we spared no pains to this end      it is touching to see the spirit manifested by some parents in this  connection  one very poor widow  whose little field of grain had been  devoured by locusts  brought a large squash and a quantity of raisins  which she had earned by laboring for others  a self denial almost equal  to her previous giving up of her only bed for the use of a daughter in  the seminary  which she brought  saying   i can sleep on the  hasseer    rush mat   if you will only receive her into school      it certainly is not benevolence to do for others what they can do as  well for themselves  or to do for them in a way to diminish either  their ability or disposition to provide for themselves  missionaries  may be in danger of staying too long and doing too much for a people   rather than of leaving them too soon after the gospel has taken root  among them     native pastors came into being at tahiti simply because the french  drove off the missionaries  they were not ordained before  but at once  proved themselves equal to the work that providence assigned them  and  after twenty years of french misrule  in spite of popery on the one  hand and brandy and vice on the other  there are now more church  members under these native pastors than ever before     twenty years ago the european shepherds were driven from madagascar   and a few lambs left in the midst of wolves  but god raised up native  pastors  and  instead of tens of christians under europeans  there are  now hundreds  yea  thousands  under these natives     those  missionaries are wise who aim constantly at results like these  and it  is in such a spirit that work has been done among the women of persia

unmarried missionary ladies   books     we have seen that among the nestorians it was counted a disgrace for a  female to learn to read  and even now  in the districts remote from  missionary influence  a woman who reads  and especially one who writes   is an object of public odium  if not of persecution  how  then  could  the nestorians be induced to send their daughters to schools  what  overcame this strong national prejudice  these questions open a  delightful chapter in divine providence  showing how wonderfully god  adapts means to ends  even on opposite sides of the globe     a christian gentleman in the state of new york  on the death of his  wife s sister  adopted into his own family her infant child  she was  trained to the exercise of a practical christian benevolence  and her  superior mind was improved by an education remarkably thorough  in the  classics and mathematics she exhibited uncommon aptitude  and made  unusual attainments  so that it was truly said of her   perhaps no  female missionary ever left our country with a mind so well disciplined  as mrs  judith s  grant   she sailed for persia  july           and  there she displayed rare ability in acquiring the language of the  people  the turkish she soon spoke familiarly  in a short time she read  the ancient syriac  and acquired the spoken language with at least  equal facility  previous even to these acquisitions  she taught mar  yohanan and others english  and as they noticed the ease with which she  turned to her greek testament  whenever ours seemed to differ from the  ancient syriac  they regarded her with feelings in which it would be  hard to say whether wonder  love  or reverence was the strongest  some  might have cried out  when her fine intellect and rare acquirements  were devoted to the missionary work   why is this waste of the ointment  made   but had her friends searched the round world for a sphere of  greatest usefulness  they could not have selected one where her rare  gifts would have accomplished so much  and when such a woman manifested  deep solicitude for the education of her sex  ancient prejudice fell  before her  she taught her own domestics to read  she sedulously  cultivated the acquaintance of both christian and mohammedan women  nor  did she rest till she had opened a school for girls in what is now mr   coan s barn  such was her zeal  that when her health would not allow  her to go there  she taught the pupils in her own apartment  she  commenced with only four scholars  but at the same time prepared the  maps for parley s geography in modern syriac  and the old map of  oroomiah  so familiar to the readers of the missionary herald  was her  handiwork  nor was her usefulness confined to her school room  hers was  the privilege of creating such a public sentiment in favor of the  education of woman  that her successors have found the gates wide open  before them  and often wondered at the extent and permanence of the  influence she acquired  there is no one topic of which miss fiske has  spoken to the writer so frequently  and with such enthusiasm  as the  great work that mrs  grant accomplished for woman in persia  during her  short missionary life  she was the laborious and self denying pioneer  in female education  and every year thus far has brought to light new  evidence of her extensive usefulness  it was no empty compliment  when  the venerable mar elias said   we will bury her in our church  where  none but very holy men are laid  as she has done so much for us  we  want the privilege of digging her grave with our own hands      miss fiske writes  shortly after her arrival   the first syriac word i  learned was  daughter   and as i can now use the verb  to give   i  often ask parents to give me their daughters  some think that i cannot  secure boarding scholars  but mrs  grant got day scholars  and when i  hear men  women  and children say   how she loved us   i want to love  them too  i mean to devote at least five years to the work of trying to  gather girls into a boarding school  as mrs  grant desired to do  she  has gone to her rest  i wonder that i am allowed to take her place    and again   i am usually in school till three p m   and then i go out  among the poor mothers till tea time  they often say to me   mrs  grant  did just as you do   her short life was a precious offering  i feel  each day more and more that i have entered into the labors of a  faithful servant of christ      among the pupils of mrs  grant was selby  of oroomiah  who was  hopefully converted while teaching some day scholars connected with the  seminary  in       raheel   rachel   the wife of siyad  the tailor  mentioned in the memoir of mr  stoddard  was another  so were sanum   the wife of joseph  meressa  the wife of yakob  and sarah  the daughter  of priest abraham  and wife of oshana  of whom we shall hear more  hereafter     after the death of mrs  grant  january           the school was  continued under the charge of mr  holladay  who employed native  teachers to assist him  the ladies of the mission cooperating as they  could  it then passed into the hands of dr  wright  who had the care of  it when miss fiske arrived in oroomiah  june           during all this  time it was only a day school  and contact with vice in the homes of  the pupils greatly hindered its usefulness  it was for this reason that  miss fiske was exceedingly anxious to make it a boarding school  so as  to retain the pupils continuously under good influences  but would they  be allowed to spend the night on the mission premises  this was doubted  by many  and all had their fears  yet in august an appropriation was  made for the support of six boarding pupils  who were to be entirely  under the control of the mission for three years  some said they could  not be obtained for even one year  and not one of them would remain to  complete the three  even priest abraham said   i cannot bear the  reproach of having my daughter live with you   at that time  scarcely a  girl twelve years old could be found who was not betrothed  and years  were devoted to the preparation of a coarse kind of embroidery  a  certain amount of which must be ready for the wedding     one day in august  mar yohanan said to miss fiske   you get ready  and  i find girls   she devoted that month and the next to preparation for  her expected charge  but the day came for opening the school  and not  one pupil had been obtained  the teacher was feeling somewhat anxious   when  from her window in the second story  she saw mar yohanan crossing  the court  with a girl in either hand  one of them was his own niece   selby  of gavalan  seven years of age  the other  hanee  of geog tapa   about three years older  they were not very inviting in outward  appearance  but it did not take miss fiske long to reach the door   where the bishop met her  and placing their little hands in hers  said   in his broken english   they be your daughters  no man take them from  your hand   she wrote to a friend an account of her success  adding   i  shall be glad to give them to the lord jesus  and love to look on them  as the beginning of my dear school   these two pupils were supported by  ladies in maiden  massachusetts  and the number soon increased to six   but fifteen days after  two of them  finding the gate open  suddenly  left for home  their teacher did not think it advisable to follow them   nor did she see them again till  ten years after  an invitation for a  reunion of all her scholars brought two whom she did not recognize  she  said   perhaps you were here under mrs  grant    no  we were your own  scholars for fifteen days  and we are very sorry we ran away   they are  now both useful christians  and the places they left in      were  speedily filled by others     the care of the school was much more exhausting than its instruction   when the teacher went out  and when she came in  she must take her  pupils with her  for she dared not leave them to themselves  indeed  so  strong were the feelings of their friends  that they allowed them to  remain only on condition that they should lodge with or near their  teacher  and never go out except in her company  a native teacher  rendered such help as he could  needing much teaching himself  and  everything combined to make the principal feel that hers was to be a  work of faith and prayer  as the first of january approached  she  thought how sweet it would be to be remembered by dear friends at mount  holyoke  and when it came  she wrote to miss whitman   in looking over  miss lyon s suggestions for the observance of the day  last year  i  cannot tell you how i felt as i read the words   perhaps next new  year s day will find some of you on a foreign shore  if so  we pledge  you a remembrance within these consecrated walls   i thought not then  that privilege would be mine  but since it is  i count your prayers the  greatest favor you can confer      at oroomiah  the missionaries met together for prayer at one o clock   and after that dr  perkins and mr  holladay preached to the assembled  seminaries  while the ladies of the mission met separately for prayer   then united intercession again closed the day  and they needed to wait  on god  for many difficulties combined to prevent success     one was the poverty of the people  to say merely that they were poor  gives no true idea of their situation to an american reader  they were  extremely poor  and grinding oppression still keeps them so  in        mr  stocking found very few pupils in the schools wearing shoes  even  in the snow of midwinter  and one sprightly lad in sabbath school had  nothing on but a coarse cotton shirt  reaching down to his knees  and a  skull cap  though the missionary required all his winter clothes   besides a fire  to keep him comfortable     another evil growing out of their poverty was  that the missionairies   in order to give the first impulse to education  resorted to some  measures which  after an interest was awakened  had to be laid aside in  order to increase it  for example  poor parents could not be persuaded  to earn bread for their children while they sent them to school  hence   to get scholars at first  the mission furnished their daily bread  and  this having been done for the boys  had to be done for the girls also   so  in the winter of          twenty five cents a week was paid to the  day scholars  the others having their board instead  but the current  having once commenced to flow in the new channel  such inducements  became more a hinderance than a help  and  in the spring of       miss  fiske told her scholars that no more money would be paid for their  bread  and though some of the mission feared it would be necessary to  resume the practice  instead of that it was soon dropped in the other  seminary also     but the special difficulty growing out of the condition of woman in a  mohammedan country demands our notice  some may suppose that because  miss fiske and miss rice have succeeded so well  an unmarried lady from  this country has nothing to do but to go there and work like any one  else  this is not true  such a one cannot live by herself  her home  must be in some missionary family  she cannot go out alone  either  inside or outside of the city  in many things she needs to be shielded  from annoyances here unknown  and god provided all that the teachers of  the seminary needed of such help  first  in the kind family of mr   stocking  and  after his death  in the pleasant household of mr   breath  indeed  not one of all the missionary circle ever stood in need  of such a hint as paul gave the church at rome concerning the deaconess  of cenchrea  as miss fiske says  playfully   whenever we went with them  to visit pupils at a distance  they always made us believe that it was  a great privilege to take us along   and every lady who goes out  in a  similar way  to labor in the missionary field  will find just such  christian kindness indispensable to her comfort and usefulness  in such  a sphere of action  a lady s dependence is her independence     another difficulty was the want of books  such a thing as a school book  had been unknown among the nestorians  the only ones to be had in       were the bible in ancient syriac   a language unintelligible to the  common people   and the gospel of john  with a few chapters of genesis   in the spoken language  besides a few tracts  later came the gospel of  matthew  and  after that  the four gospels  mr  stocking prepared a  spelling book of fifty four pages   vo  a mental arithmetic of  twenty four pages  and afterwards a larger arithmetic  mr  coan  a  scripture spelling book of one hundred and sixty pages   vo  mr   stoddard issued a very full and complete arithmetic for the older  scholars in       but his system of theology did not appear till after  his decease  in       dr  wright was the author of a geography of three  hundred and two pages  printed in       mr  cochran s scripture  geography appeared in       and barth s church history was published  the same year  but the book studied more than all others  and most  efficient in enlightening and elevating the people  was the bible  of  which the new testament appeared in       and the old in       as many  as three hours a day were devoted to that  and no recollections of  missionary education in persia are so pleasant as those of the bible  lessons  the pupils have pleasant memorials of some of them in the form  of bible maps  drawn by themselves  which now form a conspicuous and  appropriate ornament of their homes     it may seem to some as though so much study of the bible would make the  pupils weary of its sacred pages  but precisely the contrary was true   when the new testament  shortly after it was printed  was offered to  those who  during recreation hours  would commit to memory the  scripture catechism  containing more than one thousand texts  some  learned it in three weeks  and others in a longer time  and their joy  in receiving the reward could hardly be expressed  it was near the  close of the term  and some who had not quite finished when vacation  began remained to complete the task  for they said they could not go  home unless they carried with them their testament  and the diligent  use they made of it afterwards showed that their desire was more than  mere covetousness  even eighteen months after  writing to a friend in  america  they say   now we have each of us this blessed book  this  priceless blessing  would that in it we might all find salvation for  our souls  this book is from the unspeakable mercy of god  nor can we  ever repay our dear friends for it   i cannot forbear quoting here the  closing sentence of the letter   dear friend  the gentle love of the  saviour be with you  amen            chapter vi       the seminary     mae yohanan   standard of scholarship   english books read in  syriac   expense   feelings of parents   domestic department   daily  reports   picture of a week day and sabbath    if you love me  lean  hard    esli s journal   letter from pupils to mount holyoke  seminary   from the same to mrs  c  t  mills     when mar yohanan returned to persia after his visit to the united  states  in       prince malik kassim meerza  who could speak a little  english  asked him   what are the wonders of america   he replied   the  blind they do see  the deaf they do hear  and the women they do read   they be not beasts   having visited mount holyoke seminary  he often  said   of all colleges in america  mount holy oke be the best  and when  i see such a school here  i die   meaning that then he would be ready  to die  when he brought her first boarding scholars to miss fiske  he  said   now you begin mount holy oke in persia      as she sought to reproduce one of our female seminaries  as far as was  possible in such different circumstances  it seems fitting to enter  somewhat into the minutiae of its arrangements     resemblance to similar institutions at home is not as yet to be sought  in the standard of scholarship  though that is rapidly advancing  in an  unevangelized community  the people move on a lower level  not only  social condition  but morality and education  feel the want of the  elevating influence of the gospel  a seminary that commences operations  by teaching the alphabet must advance far  and climb high  before its  graduates will stand on a level with those whose pupils were familiar  with elementary algebra when they entered  yet its course of study may  be the best to secure the usefulness of its members in their own  community  if ragged village girls  untutored and uncombed  studying  aloud in school hours  and at recess leaping over the benches like wild  goats  now study diligently and in silence  move gently  and are  respectful to their teachers and kind to each other  a thorough  foundation has been laid  and if  in addition to that  the literary  attainments of the lower classes to day exceed those of the pupils who  first left the school  the superstructure rises at once beautifully and  securely     leaving out the bible   which has been already spoken of   to the  original reading  writing  singing  and composition  have been added by  degrees  grammar  geography  arithmetic  and theology  with oral  instruction in physiology  chemistry  natural philosophy  and astronomy     but we should neither understand the attainments of the pupils  nor the  source of their marked ability as writers  did we not notice that  as a  reward for good conduct during the day  their teacher was accustomed to  translate orally to them  at its close  at first simple stories  and  then such volumes as paradise lost  the course of time  and edwards s  history of redemption  to these were added such practical works as  pike s persuasives to early piety  pastor s sketches  and christ a  friend  and the pupils understood books a great deal better in the free  translations thus given  than in the more exact renderings issued from  the press  baxter s saints  rest  poured thus hot and glowing into a  syriac mould  was more effective  at least for the time  than the same  after it had cooled and been laboriously filed into fidelity to the  original     the seminary was unlike similar schools at home in the matter of  expense  in       the cost for each pupil was only about eighteen  dollars for the year  including rent  board  fuel  lights  and clothing  in part  and as this was paid by the american board  education to the  people was without money and without price  we have already alluded to  the efforts of the teachers to train up the people to assume this  expense themselves     let us now trace the progress made in getting the pupils away from the  evil influences of their persian homes  in       besides her six  boarding pupils  miss fiske had a few day scholars  next year she had  still fewer  and the year after that  they were dropped entirely  many  wished to send their daughters in this way  but she was decided in her  refusal to receive them  because thus only could the highest good of  the pupils be secured  at first  so great was her dread of home  influences  that she sought to retain them even in vacation  but she  soon saw that their health and usefulness  their sympathy with the  people  and the confidence of the people in them  required them to  spend a part of the year at home  this also gave their teachers a good  opportunity to become acquainted with their friends and neighbors  and  a door was opened for many delightful meetings with women  in which the  pupils rendered much assistance  it also secured the influence of the  parents in favor of what was for the good of their daughters  and made  them interested in the school  during miss fiske s entire residence in  persia  fathers rarely disregarded her wishes concerning their  daughters in her school     the only time that the teachers were ever reviled by a nestorian father  was in the case of a village priest  he came one day to the seminary to  see his daughter  and because she did not appear at once   she was  engaged at the moment   he cursed and swore  in a great passion  and  when she did come  carried her home  no notice was taken of it  and no  effort made to get her back  but three years after  the first  indications of his interest in religion were deep contrition for his  conduct on that occasion  and a letter full of grief for such treatment  of those who had come so far to tell him and his of jesus  he at once  sent his daughter back  and three weeks after she too came to the  saviour  and even begged  as a favor  to have the care of the rooms of  the teachers her father had reviled  since then  the priest has written  no less than three letters  as he says  to be sure that so great  wickedness was really pardoned  it seemed to him so unpardonable     the circumstances of the seminary required a domestic department  it  was difficult  in persia  to have girls only ten years old take charge  of household affairs  yet a beginning was made  but how much labor of  love and patience of hope it involved cannot be told to those who have  not tried it  at first  their one hour of work each day was more of a  hinderance than a help  but gradually  through watchfulness and much  effort  they were brought to do the whole without the least  interference with their regular duties in school  they were thus  trained to wait upon themselves  and so one deeply rooted evil of  oriental life was corrected  this practice also relieved the school of  the bad influence of domestics  while it prepared the pupils for lives  of contented usefulness among a people so poor as the nestorians   besides  in this way they acquired habits of regularity and punctuality  such as they never saw in their own homes     but while these western habits were inculcated  such of their own  customs as were harmless were left untouched  they were carefully  taught to do things in their own way  so as naturally and easily to  fall into their proper place at home     at first  in their daily reports  miss fiske dared not ask any question  the answer to which she could not ascertain for herself  the earliest  she ventured to put was  whether they had combed their hair that day   the pupils all stood up  and those who had attended to this duty were  asked to sit down  the faithful ones were delighted to comply  the  others  mortified and ashamed  remained standing  but if one of them  tried to sit down  a glance of the eye detected her  this simple method  laid a foundation for truthfulness and self respect  and from this the  teacher gradually advanced to other questions  as their moral sense  became able to bear them  till  when they could answer five  satisfactorily  such as   have you all your knitting needles    were  you at prayers    were you late    things that could be ascertained at  once   they thought themselves wonderfully good  little dreaming how  much the teacher did not dare to ask  lest she should lead them into  temptation  after the first revival  she could ask about things that  took place out of her sight  and now this exercise is conducted in the  same way as in our best schools at home  there is very little  communication now between them in the school room  in       there were  only five failures on this point for four months  and those by new  scholars  dr  perkins wrote  that year   the exact system in this  school  and the order  studiousness  good conduct  and rapid  improvement of the pupils  in both this and the other seminary  are  probably unsurpassed in any schools in america      in reply to a request for the picture of a day in the seminary  miss  fiske writes  in             you ask for a day of my life in persia  come  then  to my home in        you shall be waked by the noise of a hand bell at early dawn   twenty minutes after  our girls are ready for their half hour of silent  devotion  the bell for this usually finds them waiting for it  and the  perfect quiet in the house is almost unbroken  at the close of it   another bell summons us to the school room for family devotion  where   besides reading the scriptures and prayer  they unite in singing one of  our sweet hymns     in a few minutes after this  another bell calls us  to breakfast  and  that finished  all attend to their morning work   tables are cleared  rooms put in order  and preparations made for  supper  the principal meal in persia  then for an hour they study  silently in their rooms  at a quarter before nine o clock i enter the  school room  while miss rice cares for things without  we open school  with prayer  in which we carry to the master more of our little cares  and trials than in the early morning  my first lesson is in daniel   with the older pupils  while two other classes go out to recite in  another room  yonan stays with me  for i want him to help and be helped  in these bible lessons  the class enjoy it exceedingly  and the forty  minutes spent on it always seem too short  the other classes now come  in  and all study or recite another forty minutes  after that  a short  recess in the yard makes all fresh again  the older classes then study   while one of the younger ones has a bible lesson with me on the life of  christ  each time i go over it with them i find things which i wonder i  had not perceived before  it is delightful to hear them express their  own thoughts of our blessed saviour  we trace his journeyings on maps  prepared by the pupils  and they study the scripture geography of each  place  after this  one class recites ancient syriac to yonan  and  another  in physiology  goes out to miss rice  leaving me to spend  forty minutes with the older girls on compositions  at present the  topic is   the christ of the old testament   and i am thankful that i  studied edwards s history of redemption under miss lyon  this done   fifteen minutes remain for a kind of general exercise  when we talk  over many things  and then the noon recess of one and a half hours  allows the girls to lunch  see friends  and recreate  till fifteen  minutes before its close  when they have a prayer meeting by  themselves   footnote    at first  only one hymn was printed on a  separate sheet  then a little hymn book of five   as many as luther  commenced with at the reformation  now the hymn book contains about two  hundred hymns  and some of the pupils can repeat them all       in the afternoon  miss rice takes charge of the school  and i have the  time out  at present the first hour is given to writing  soon astronomy  will take its place  recitations in geography follow till recess  and  after that singing or spelling  the last hour  i go in and hear a  lesson in hebrews  on this epistle we have full notes prepared in  syriac  and we study it carefully  in connection with the old  testament  miss rice also has a lesson in judges  and then all come  together for the daily reports  more as a family than a school  there  is still an hour before supper for mutual calls  knitting  sewing  and  family duties  after supper and work are over  and they have had a  little time to themselves  come evening prayers  then they have a short  study hour in their rooms  followed by the half hour for private  devotion  which closes the day      of course  at another time  the studies might be somewhat different   the hours that miss rice and i are out of school we spend in seeing  visitors  holding prayer meetings  going out among the women  and  sometimes devote a whole day to a distant village      having thus looked in on a day of study  let us  through the same  glass  take a view of the lord s day  the letter is dated december            my dear friend  i have learned here that he who fed five thousand with  the portion of five can feed the soul to the full with what i once  counted only crumbs  may i give you one of the master s sermons  a few  sabbaths ago  i went to geog tapa with mr  stoddard  it was afternoon   and i was seated on a mat in the middle of the earthen floor of the  church  i had already attended sabbath school and a prayer meeting with  my pupils  and  weary  i longed for rest  it seemed as if i could not  sit without support through the service  then i remembered that after  that came my meeting with the women readers of the village  and o  how  desirable seemed rest  but god sent it in an unexpected way  for a  woman came and seated herself directly behind me  so that i could lean  on her  and invited me to do so  i declined  but she drew me back   saying   if you love me  lean hard   very refreshing was that support   and then came the master s own voice  repeating the words   if you love   me   lean hard   and i leaned on him too  feeling that  through that  poor woman  he had preached me a better sermon than i could have heard  at home  i was rested long before the services were through  then i  spent an hour with the women  and after sunset rode six miles to my own  home  i wondered that i was not weary that night nor the next morning   and i have rested ever since on those sweet words   if you love me   lean hard      but i intended to tell you of our sabbaths in school  saturday is the  girls  day for washing and mending  and we are busy all day long  just  before sunset  the bell calls us to the school room  and there we  inquire if the last stitch is taken  and the rooms are all in order  if  any thing is still undone  the half hour before supper sees it  finished  after leaving the table  every thing is arranged for the  morning  and then we have a quiet half hour in our rooms  after this   half the pupils come to miss rice  and half to me  each has a prayer  meeting  remembering the absent ones  also the female seminaries in  constantinople  south hadley  mass    and oxford  ohio   all retire  from these precious meetings to their  half hour   as they call it  and  before nine o clock all is quiet  unless it be the voice of some one  still pleading with her god     the first bell  sabbath morning  is at half past five  when all rise  and dress for the day  morning prayers are at half past six  then comes  breakfast  and  our few morning duties being done  the girls retire to  study their sabbath school lessons  and sometimes ask to meet together  for prayer  at half past nine  we attend syriac service in the chapel   the sabbath school follows that  numbering now about two hundred  pupils  about two thirds of our scholars are teachers in it  and it is  a good preparation for teaching in their homes  those who do not teach  form a class  we then go home to lunch  flavored with pleasant  remembrances and familiar explanations of the morning service  the  afternoon service commences at two o clock  and our bible lessons an  hour before supper  though some are called earlier  to help us teach  the women who come in for instruction  at supper  all are allowed to  ask bible questions  and before leaving the table we have evening  prayers  at seven o clock  miss rice and i go to the english prayer  meeting  while the pupils meet in six or seven family meetings  as they  call them  the inmates of each room being by themselves  and the pious  among them taking turns in conducting them  if any wish to come to us  after this  we are glad to see them  and often this hour witnesses the  submission of souls to god     besides these there is a weekly prayer meeting on tuesday evening  a  lecture on friday afternoon  and on wednesday  as well as sabbath  evening  the school meets in two divisions for prayer     the following journal  kept during the revival  in       by esli  an  assistant teacher  forms an appropriate continuation of this interior  picture of the seminary         february  st   to day  a part of the girls wrote compositions on   anger   and a part on  the gospel         d  friday   john was here to day writing to mount holyoke seminary   and attended our noon prayer meeting  in the afternoon  deacon joseph  of degala preached from the words  king of kings and lord of lords   in  the evening  mr  coan sung with us  and we read the weekly report of  our conduct        th  sabbath   in the forenoon  dr  wright preached from acts ii       he said that we must know what sin is  that we are sinners  and that we  cannot save ourselves  in the afternoon  priest eshoo preached from  luke xv      the evening prayer meetings were very pleasant        th   a blessed morning  some of the girls are thoughtful  this was  seen in the quiet at table and the silence in the kitchen  the work was  done both earlier and better than usual  during the study hour  the  voice of prayer sounded very sweetly in every room  when the girls  walked in the yard  it was very quiet  and so when they came in  our  noon prayer meeting was very pleasant  miss rice said a few words on  the shortness of time  while hanee prayed  some wept  when miss rice  dismissed us  no one moved  all were bowed on their desks  weeping  she  then gave opportunity for prayer  and while i prayed  all were in  tears  the girls have kept all the rules well to day  this evening  the  communicants met with miss rice  and the rest with martha  miss rice  read about jonah in the ship  and said a few words  after that  raheel  the teacher prayed  then hanee spoke a little of her own state  and  asked us to pray for raheel of ardishai  who is thoughtful  i spoke   and asked them to pray for hannah and parangis  who are in my room        th  the state of our school is the same  mr  cochran preached on the  faithfulness of the jews under nehemiah  when they rebuilt jerusalem   after meeting he told us that the members of the male seminary spent  yesterday as a day of fasting and prayer  and many rose confessing  their sins  one very wicked man  also from the village  asked them to  pray for him  after work was done in the kitchen this evening  a little  time remained  and the girls there asked to have a meeting  with  gladness of heart i knelt and mingled my tears with theirs  as though  i  too  were commencing the work  afterwards mr  coan came and sung  with us  and we read the accounts of the week      esli  the writer of the above  is the daughter of yohanan  a pious man  in geog tapa  who for a time was steward of the seminary  she was one  of the first fruits of the revival of       and graduated after miss  fiske s return to america  she has since been a most faithful assistant  of miss rice  and is very much beloved by the pious nestorians  but the  following letter to miss fiske  from her own pen  dated april        will form her best introduction to the reader        when i recall your love to me  my heart is full  i remember the times  when we knelt together before our father in heaven  in godly anguish  for priceless souls  especially do i remember when god first came near  to me  how you shared my sorrow by day and by night  and pointed me to  him who bled for me  after you brought me to christ  you showed me the  helps to a christian life  that i must pray not only in my closet  but  also in my heart  when at work or studying  that god would keep me  o  that i had heeded your counsels more      this winter the lord led me to see my cold state  for a time the  saviour s face was hidden  then it seemed to be midnight  but i looked  above  and the darkness fled  i saw him standing with open arms  and  quickly i threw myself into those arms  tears of joy fell from my eyes   and by the grace of god i was enabled to go forward day by day  secret  prayer has since been very pleasant to me      we have had pleasant seasons of prayer in our school this winter  and  we trust that some souls have been born again  i have the care of a  circle of girls in the kitchen  they work well  and keep it clean  i  think you know that such work is difficult  but if you were to come in  you would find every thing in order  every wednesday we scour all the  shelves and the doors      the girls have made the yard very pleasant  but one thing is wanting  there  we miss you at the cool of the day  walking in it to see if any  evil has grown up in your garden      i went to my village in vacation  the prayer meetings there were very  pleasant  and i enjoyed much  praying with the women alone  our seasons  of family devotion also were delightful  in the morning we read the  acts in course  and as each read a verse  my father asked its meaning   when he went away to preach  i used to lead  and we then read the  portion for the day  in the book called  green pastures for the lord s  flock       in the school we have studied ezra  in connection with haggai and  zechariah  and are now in nehemiah  in the new testament we are on  paul s third journey  and have nearly finished scripture geography and  theology      the seminary keeps up a christian intercourse with the institution at  south hadley  as the following letters will show  and the beautiful  melodeon in the sitting room is a tuneful testimony to the liberality  of holyoke s daughters      many salutations and much love from the school of miss fiske to you   our dear sisters of the school at mount holyoke  we rejoice that there  is such a great institution full of holy words and the warm love of  christ  we hear that many of you have an inheritance above  and are  daily looking forward to it  we want to tell you how glad we are that  the holy spirit has come among you  and that god has turned so many to  himself  though we are great sinners  we rejoice exceedingly in the  success of the work of god in every place  and we beg you to pray that  the holy spirit may visit us also  and our people  and strike sharp  arrows into flinty hearts  that they may melt like wax before the fire   blessed be god  that though we had become the least of all nations  and  adopted many customs worse than the heathen  and our holy books were  carefully laid away and never used  yet he put love into the hearts of  his servants  that they should come to this dark land  we are greatly  obliged to you and to your people for so kindly sending us these  missionaries  they have greatly multiplied our books  and  as we trust   brought many souls to christ  some of us  formerly  knew not who christ  was  or whether a redeemer had died for us  but now he has gathered us  together in this school of godly instruction  and some of us are  awaking to our sins  and to the great love god has shown in sending his  son to die for us  we thank god very much that we know jesus christ   the only saviour      again  we want to thank you for sending miss fiske to teach us the way  of life  we love her because she greatly loves us  and desires our  salvation  every day she takes much trouble that we may be the  daughters of god  but her burdens are so great  that we fear she will  not remain long with us  unless some one comes to help her  and now we  have a petition to present  we hear that in many of you dwelleth the  spirit of our master  jesus christ  and that you are ready to leave  home and friends  and go to distant lands  to gather the lost sheep of  christ  dear sisters  our petition is  that you will send us a  teacher     we shall greatly rejoice if one comes  and will love her  very much  we ask this  not because we do not love miss fiske  no  no   this is not in our hearts  but she is weak  and her work is more than  she can do alone  we shall expect one to come  and pray god to bring  her to us in safety   footnote    miss mary susan rice  already  mentioned in these pages  went out this same year         from the  seminary in south hadley       please remember us in your closets and in your meetings  and ask your  friends to pray for us and for our people  farewell  beloved sisters      the following extracts are from a letter written by them  in       to  miss susan l  tolman  now mrs  cyrus t  mills of the sandwich islands   and formerly of ceylon        much love from the members of the female seminary of oroomiah to you   our dear miss tolman  we are very glad to find one who loves us so  much  and prays for us  our delight in your letter was greater than we  can express  miss fiske came in joyfully with it in her hand  and while  she read  it seemed as if you were present  inviting and drawing us to  christ      give our love to all in your favored school  and ask them to pray for  us  we love all those dear ladies  because they have been so kind to  us  and have been willing that miss fiske and miss rice should leave  them  and come here for our sakes  though they were dear to you  we  think that now they have come to us  your joy in them is greater  we  hope to hear of many of you carrying the leaves of life to the dark  corners of the earth      dear miss tolman  you said   you love miss fiske  you must also love  miss rice   did you think that we would not love her  we love them  both  not only for leaving their friends to come to us  but also  because they are full of the love of our dear redeemer      we have heard that you are going to india  we are glad  and love you  more for it  because the love of christ constrains you to this  and  thus in spirit you come very near to our dear teachers  we entreat  almighty god to be with you  and bring you in safety to the place he  appoints for you  that you may be a light among a dark people  we hope  that when there you will not forget us  but write us about your work   and about the daughters of india  whether they love you much or not   tell your friends not to sorrow for you  but to rejoice that they have  a friend ready to go and teach those who know not christ  the saviour  guide you in all your labors      those who aided miss lyon to carry out her large hearted plans in new  england  little dreamed that offshoots from the vine they planted would  so soon be carried to the ends of the earth  who does not admire that  grace which  in this missionary age  raised up such a type of piety to  be diffused over the globe  doubtless it will undergo changes in  persia  as it has done already  but the devout student of providence  will watch its growth with interest  and its developments will not  disappoint his hopes           chapter vii       vacation scenes     in gawar and ishtazin   villages of memikan   oobeya  darawe  and  sanawar   in gavalan   accommodations   sabbath school     to the interior pictures of the school in the last chapter we add some  vacation scenes  though chronologically in advance of other things yet  to come      illustration  tents      towards the close of july        mr  stocking and family  with misses  fiske and rice  and several native helpers  spent the vacation in  gawar  mr  coan accompanied them on his way to regions beyond   wandering from place to place  like the patriarchs of old  they pitched  their tents at first near the village of memikan  a sketch of these  tents is here presented  the women there were frequent visitors  and  few went away without some idea of the truth as it is in jesus  the  pious natives were unwearied in labor  and sometimes woke the  missionaries in the morning with prayer for the people round about  them  on the sabbath  there was preaching in as many as five different  villages  and after morning service in memikan  the women came to the  tents to receive more particular instruction from their own sex  in the  evening  a mother who had buried her son in february  then a very  promising member of the seminary at seir     brought her youngest  daughter  about six years of age  saying   we give her to you in the  place of guwergis  he has gone to a blessed place  you led him there   we thank you  and now intrust to you our little daughter   eshoo  the  father  spoke of his departed son with much feeling  but most sweet  submission  he said to miss fiske  as the big tears glistened in the  moonlight   i shall not be here long  i shall soon rejoin him  my hope  in jesus grows stronger every day   the death of that dear son was not  only a great spiritual blessing to him  but the mere mention of his  name at once secured the attention of the villagers to any thing the  missionaries had to say about his saviour   footnote    nestorian  biography  p           on monday  they left for a visit to the alpine district of ishtazin   unable to take horses along those frightful paths  they rode on hardy  mules  in a subsequent journey over the same road  the fastenings of  miss fiske s saddle gave way  and she fell  but providentially without  injury  sometimes they climbed  or  more hazardous still  descended  a  long  steep stairway of rock  or they were hid in the clouds that hung  around the higher peaks of the mountain  now the path led them under  huge  detached rocks  that seemed asking leave to overwhelm them  and  now under the solid cliffs  that suggested the more grateful idea of  the shadow of a great rock in a weary land  down in the valley were  pleasant waterfalls  little fields rescued by much labor from the  surrounding waste  choice fruits  and such a variety of flowers  that  it seemed as if spring  summer  and autumn had combined to supply them   then  in looking up  the eye rested on silver threads apparently  hanging down from far off summits  but really foaming streams dashing  headlong down the rocks  yet so distant that no sound came to the ear  from their roaring waters     the party stopped at ooreya  on one of its flat roofs  shaded by a  magnificent walnut tree  the villagers brought mulberries  apples  and  other fruits  till they could prepare something more substantial  and  seemed to forget their fears of the patriarch in their zealous  hospitality  after supper  all adjourned to the churchyard  and there   in the bright moonlight  a crowd of eager listeners heard of christ   and redemption through his precious blood  the silence of night was  broken only by the voice of the preacher  and the echoes of the  surrounding cliffs seemed to repeat joyfully the unwonted sounds  yonan  preached from the words  jesus went about all galilee  teaching in  their synagogues  and preaching the gospel of the kingdom   he  commenced by asking whether christ was right in so doing  they replied    certainly he did right    yes   said the preacher   and as he did  so  must his followers do  and you must expect to see them in ishtazin   when we cease to climb over these precipices to come to you  fear lest  we have become mussulmans  for christians cannot but go from village to  village to preach the gospel   the reader will see the force of such an  appeal  when he remembers that mar shimon had forbidden these people to  receive the missionaries because they preached  this was followed by a  statement of the doctrines that jesus preached  in which he did not  fail to bring out the essence of the gospel  when he sat down  khamis   the brother of deacon tamo  followed with a most impassioned  exhortation  the missionaries had thought him a good preacher before   but the place and the circumstances  he was among his own native  mountains  seemed to carry him beyond himself  all through this region   the people appeared to render as much honor to him as they would have  done to mar shimon  the assembly dispersed  and the travellers lay down  where they were  to battle with the sand flies till the welcome dawn  lit up the conspicuous summits high above them     almost every moment of the next forenoon was filled by personal  religious conversation with many who never heard such truths before  in  the evening  even more fixed attention was given to another service in  the open air  at the village of boobawa  for the pious mar ogen    was  then living there  and the bright light of his piety had not shone in  vain  several were earnestly inquiring how to be saved   footnote     nestorian biography  p           on thursday  the day after their return to memikan  mr  coan  priest  dunkha  khamis  and deacon john left for central koordistan  and deacon  isaac went to kochannes  but though the laborers were fewer  the number  of visitors continued the same  next sabbath  besides two services  and  two meetings with the women in memikan  there was preaching in three  other villages  in chardewar  the home of priest dunkha  miss fiske  found his daughter  who had come with them from oroomiah  already full  of work  she had just dismissed her sabbath school  and was reading the  bible with her cousin  the village priest  who did all in his power to  help her  both in her school through the week  and her meetings with  the women  one sabbath  almost every woman in the place had been  present  as was the case also when she was visited by misses fiske and  rice  and sanum said that she could not ask for a better place in which  to work for christ  there was more of real hunger for the truth here  than any where else in the mountains     leaving memikan  the travellers removed to darawe  the village  described on page     here they could scarcely get permission to pitch  their tent  or procure provision for themselves and horses  yet even in  such a place  the manifestation of christian love was not without  fruit  though many bitterly opposed them to the last  the neighboring  villages wondered at the missionaries going there at all  and still  more at their being able to remain     at keyat  the kindness of the people  and pleasant intercourse with  them  were all the more grateful for the contrast with what had gone  before  here miss fiske met with that kind reception from mar shimon   then passing through the place  described on page      while the tent  literally flowed with milk and honey furnished by the villagers  whom  he had charged to take good care of their visitors     on the following sabbath  yonan preached to a congregation of about two  hundred  at sanawar  where forty families of refugees from saat were  spending the summer  when miss fiske and miss rice visited their camp   they found a number of temporary huts enclosing a circle  where the  domestic labors of spinning  weaving  and cooking were actively going  on  all the women at once left their work  and welcomed their visitors  with every mark of confidence and gladness  some of them had heard the  gospel from the missionaries in mosul  as they had often spent the  winter near there  so they drank in every word with eagerness     the ladies were delighted with their visit  especially with a widow   who  though unable to read  showed unusual familiarity with the bible   and  as they hoped  a spiritual acquaintance with its doctrines  when  the topic of our fallen nature was mentioned   yes   said she   we were  all shapen in iniquity  as david testifies   when asked if she had any  hope of being saved from sin  she replied   i am very far from god  yet  my only hope is in the wounded side of jesus christ  if penitently i  stand beneath the blood dropping from his cross  i hope that my sins   though red like scarlet  may become as white as snow   her views of the  way of salvation were not only clear  but beautifully expressed  it was  exceedingly refreshing  in that region where they had expected only  darkness  thus to find the rays of light struggling through from their  associates in another mission  and it gave a delightful foretaste of  the time when the voice of one watchman upon those mountain tops should  reach to another  and on all sides the eye behold the trophies of  immanuel  it was with feelings of peculiar interest that they heard   some years after  that this stranger in sanawar  but  as they fondly  hoped  their sister in christ  held fast her confidence in his grace to  the end  and so fell asleep in jesus     for a companion picture to the preceding  we turn to the summer of        mr  stocking moved out to gavalan  the native place of mar  tohanan  early in the season  and both teachers followed  with thirteen  of their pupils  about the middle of june  the village lies near the  base of a range of mountains  at the northern end of the plain of  oroomiah  forty miles distant from the city  on the east the blue  waters of the lake seem to touch the sky  and stretch away to the south  in quiet loveliness  sometimes  when reposing in the gorgeous light of  sunset  or reflecting the red rays of the full moon  they remind the  beholder of the  sea of glass mingled with fire  revealed to the  beloved disciple  the breeze from the lake  in the long summer days  is  very grateful  and the evening air from the mountains makes sleep  refreshing     mar yohanan gave the school free use of two rooms as long as it  remained  in the court yard before them a large tent was pitched  that  served for dining room  dormitory  and reception room  or diwan khaneh   an adjoining house afforded a comfortable recitation room  here the  regular routine of the school went on  and while men from the village  found their way to mr  stocking s at the hour of evening prayer  women  also came to the school room at the same hour  at the last meeting of  this kind before miss fiske returned to the city  nearly forty were  present  listening with quiet attention to the words of life  on the  sabbath  the sides of the tent were lifted outward from the bottom  and  fastened in a horizontal position  so as to admit the air and exclude  the sun  the ground beneath was covered with mats  and formed quite a  pleasant chapel  in the forenoon  this was thronged with attentive  hearers  the children of the boys  school in the village sat close to  their teacher  the members of the girls  school could be distinguished  from their playmates by the greater smoothness of their hair  the  whiteness of their faces  and general tidiness  among the old men  the  venerable father of the bishop was very conspicuous  the members of the  seminary crowded round their teachers so as to leave more room for  others  and still all could not get under the shadow of the wings of  the tabernacle  mr  stocking preached in the forenoon  and in the  afternoon the people came together again as a sabbath school  each of  the pupils of the seminary had a class of women or girls  and seemed to  learn how to do good faster than ever before  they visited them at  their houses during the week  they sought out the absentees  and it was  delightful to go round the school and note the interest of both scholar  and teacher  if these were zealous in teaching  those were no less so  in learning  the classes  after the introductory services  filled every  available corner in the rooms  the tent  the front of the house  and  even sat on the low mud wall of the court  with the same variety of  character  there was greater diversity of lessons than in schools at  home  some studied the old testament  and some the new  others were  just learning to read  and those who could not read at all were taught  the scriptures orally  one class of armenians was taught in turkish     matters went on very well for two sabbaths  but on the third  women and  children had vanished  what was the matter  it had been reported that  all this labor was only a preparation to transport them to america  and  the simple minded mothers staid away with their children in great  trepidation  but visits from house to house  during the week  dispelled  their fears  and next sabbath all were again in their places  and this  pleasant labor in gavalan continued till september           chapter viii       early labors for women     first meetings with them   first convekt   first lessons   wild women  of ardishai     the teachers of the seminary did not confine their labors to its  inmates  they expended both time and toil for adult women as well as  for their daughters  and never felt that they gave them too large a  proportion of their labors  at first there was a strong feeling among  most of the women that they might not worship god along with deacons  and readers  and so they could not be persuaded to attend public  preaching  but miss fiske found that a few would come to her room at  the same hour  so  encouraged by her missionary sisters whose hearts  were in the work  but whose family cares prevented their doing it  themselves  she visited the women at their houses  to urge them to come  in  then  as her own knowledge of the language was as yet imperfect   this was in        and she wisely judged that listening to a gentleman  would sooner prepare them to come in to the regular service  she  secured one of the missionary brethren to conduct the meeting  the  first day only five attended  but soon she enjoyed the sight of about  forty mothers listening to the truth as it is in jesus  on the third  sabbath  she was struck with the fixed attention of one of them  and   on talking with her alone  found her deeply convinced of sin  she had  not before seen one who did not feel perfectly prepared to die  but  this one groaned  being burdened  and seemed bowed to the dust with the  sense of her unworthiness  when miss fiske prayed with her  she  repeated each petition in a whisper after her  and rose from her knees  covered with perspiration  so intensely was she moved  her life  she  said  had been one of rebellion against god  and she knew that no  prayers  fasts  or other outward observances  had benefited her  or  could procure forgiveness  in this state of mind she was directed to  christ and his righteousness as her only hope  and though for some time  little progress was apparent  at length  as she herself expressed it    i was praying  and the lord poured peace into my soul   the change in  her character was noticed by her neighbors  from being one of the most  turbulent and disagreeable of the women in her vicinity  she became  noted for her gentleness and general consistency  she has since died   and her last days were full of a sweet trust in her saviour  she was  the first inquirer among nestorian women     this meeting was given up as soon as the women found their way to the  regular service  but ever since there have been separate meetings for  them at other hours     until the revival in       those who conducted these meetings had to  labor alone  for there were none of the nestorians to help them   indeed  miss fiske had been in oroomiah more than two years  before  women came much to her for strictly religious conversation  or could be  induced to sit down to the study of the scriptures     some of her first efforts to interest them in the bible were almost  amusing in the difficulties encountered  and the manner in which they  were overcome     she would seat herself among them on the earthen floor  and read a  verse  then ask questions to see if they understood it  for example   after reading the history of the creation  for she began at the  beginning   she asked   who was the first man    answer    what do we  know  we are women   which was about equivalent in english to  we are  donkeys   the passage was read again  and the question repeated with no  better success  then she told them  adam was the first man  and made  them repeat the name adam over and over till they remembered it  the  next question was   what does it mean   here  too  they could give no  answer  not because they did not know  for the word was in common use  among them  but they had no idea that they could answer  and so they  did not  and were perfectly delighted to find that the first man was  called  red earth   because he was made of it  this was enough for one  lesson  it set them to thinking  it woke up faculties previously  dormant  the machinery was there  perfect in all its parts  but so  rusted from disuse  that it required no little skill and patience to  make it move at all  but the least movement was a great gain  more was  sure to follow  another lesson would take up eve  syriac   hawa    meaning  life    miss fiske would begin by saying   is not that a  pretty name  and would you not like to know that you had a  great great grandmother called  life   now  that was the name of our  first mother  both yours and mine   it was interesting to notice how  faces previously stolid would light up with animation after that  if  the preacher happened to repeat the name of our first parents  and how  one would touch another  whispering with childish joy   didn t you  hear  he said adam      such were the women who came to the seminary for instruction  but the  teachers also went forth to search out the no less besotted females in  the villages  and  as a counterpart to the above  we present an account  of labors among the wild women of ardishai  a village twelve miles  south east from oroomiah     when miss fiske had been in oroomiah about one year  mr  stocking  proposed a visit to ardishai  so the horses were brought to the gate   one bearing the tent  another the baskets containing mr  stocking s  children  and a third miscellaneous baggage  besides the saddle horses   the first night  the tent was pitched on one of the threshing floors of  geog tapa  but as american ladies were a novelty in ardishai  the party  there  in order to secure a little quiet  had to pitch their tent on  the flat roof of a house  it was miss fiske s first day in a large  village  and she became so exhausted by talking with the women  that  she can never think of that weary saturday without a feeling of  fatigue  as the village is near the lake  the swarms of mosquitoes  allowed them no rest at night  and morning again brought the crowd with  its idle curiosity as unsatisfied as the appetite of more diminutive  assailants  about nine o clock  all went to the church  where mr   stocking preached  while the women sat in most loving proximity to  their strange sisters  handling and commenting on their dresses during  the discourse  mr  stocking could preach though others talked  and  readily raised his voice so as to be heard above the rest  at the  close  priest abraham  without consulting any one  rose and announced  two meetings for the afternoon  one in another church for men  and a  second in this for women  who must all come  because the lady from the  new world was to preach  so the news flew through the neighboring  villages  the good lady called the priest to account for his doings   but he replied   i knew that they would come if i said that  and yon  can preach very well  for your girls told me so   he was greatly  disappointed  however  when he found that his notice left him alone to  preach to the men  while mr  stocking preached to some six hundred  women  with half as many children  they were a rude  noisy company  not  one of them all caring for the truth  and there was no moment when at  least half a dozen voices could not be heard besides the preacher s   when he closed  as many as twenty cried out   now let miss fiske  preach   so he withdrew  and left her to their tender mercies  her  preaching was soon finished  she simply told them  that when she knew  their language better  she would come and talk with them  but she could  not talk at the same time that they did  for god had given her a very  small voice  and her words would no more mingle with theirs than oil  and water  they said   oil and water never mix  but we will be silent  if you will come and preach   months passed on  and she again visited  the village  the women remembered her promise  and hundreds came  together  but they did not remember to be silent  as soon as she began   they began  and if she asked them to be quiet  each exhorted her  neighbor  at the top of her voice  to be still  and the louder the  uproar  of course the louder the reproofs  at length miss fiske said    i cannot say any more  unless you all put your fingers on your  mouths   all the fingers went up  and she proceeded   i have a good  story to tell you  but if one takes her finger from her mouth  i cannot  tell it   instantly muzzled voices  all round the church  cried   be  still  be still  so that we can hear the story   some minutes elapsed   and the four hundred women were silent   once there was an old woman  i  did not know her  nor did my father  and i think my grandfather did  not  but he told me    here commenced many inquiries about said  grandfather  but again the fingers were ordered to their places  and  their owners told that they should hear no more about the woman if they  talked about the grandfather   now  this woman talked in meeting   i  should think she must have been a relative of yours  for ours do not  talk in meeting   and after many reproofs she was forbidden to go to  church any more if she continued to do so  she promised very  faithfully  but  poor woman  she could not be still  then  as soon as  she heard her own voice  she cried out   o  i have spoken in meeting   what shall i do  why  i keep speaking  and i cannot stop   now  you are  very much like this woman  and as i think you cannot stop  i must   by  this time their fingers were pressed closely on their lips  and no one  made a reply  having thus secured silence  miss fiske took the new  testament  and read to them of mary  who  she was sure  never talked in  meeting  for if she had  jesus would not have loved her so much  she  talked to them about fifteen minutes more  and prayed with them  and  they went away very still and thoughtful     miss fiske gave this account to the writer  with no idea that he would  print it  but he thinks  and the reader will doubtless agree with  him  that in no other way could he convey so vivid an idea of woman as  she was in persia  or the tact needed to secure a first hearing for the  truth  miss fiske was often called to deal with just such rude  assemblages  and by varied methods she generally succeeded in securing  attention  in subsequent visits to ardishai the number of hearers was  never again so large  but they came together from better motives  and   as we shall see  not without the blessing of the lord  in march         miss rice met nearly three hundred women in the same church  some of  them awakened  and a few already hopefully pious           chapter ix       fruits of labor in nestorian homes     usefulness among relatives of pupils   deacon guwergis   reformed  drunkard and his daughter   maternal meetings    early inquirers from  geog tapa   parting address of mr  holladay   visit to geog  tapa   selby and her closet     having thus glanced at early labors for women in the seminary and in  the villages  let us now turn to another field of usefulness among the  relatives of the pupils  who came to visit them in school  and here we  are at no loss for a notable illustration     in the autumn of       deacon guwergis  of tergawer   and almost every  reader was either priest or deacon   brought his oldest daughter  then  about twelve years of age  and begged for her admission to the  seminary  he was known as one of the vilest and most defiantly  dissolute of the nestorians  and miss fiske shrunk from receiving the  daughter of such a man into her flock  yet  on the ground that  like  her master  she was sent not to the righteous  but to the lost  she  concluded to receive her  still the father  during his short stay   showed such a spirit of avarice and shameless selfishness   he even  asked for the clothes his daughter had on when she came   that she  rejoiced when he went away     his home was twenty five miles off  in the mountains  and she hoped  that winter snows would soon shield her from his dreaded visits  little  did she think that his next coming would result in his salvation  in  february he again presented himself at her door in his koordish  costume  gun  dagger  and belt of ammunition all complete  he came on  saturday  when many of the pupils were weeping over their sins  and the  teacher could not but feel that the wolf had too truly entered the  fold  he ridiculed their anxiety for salvation  and opposed the work of  grace  in his own reckless way  she tried to guard her charge from his  attacks as best she could  but they were too divinely convinced of sin  to be much affected by what he said  his own daughter  at length   distressed at his conduct  begged him to go alone with her to pray    the window on the right of the central door of the seminary points out  the place   ho mocked and jeered  but went  confident in his power to  cure her superstition   do you not think that i too can pray   and he  repeated over his form in ancient syriac  as a wizard would mutter his  incantation  his child then implored mercy for her own soul  and for  her perishing father  as a daughter might be expected to do  just  awakened to her own guilt and the preciousness of redemption  as he  heard the words  save  o  save my father  going down to destruction    he raised his clinched hand to strike  but  as he said afterwards   god  held me back from it   no entreaties of his daughter could prevail on  him to enter the place of prayer again that day     the native teacher  murad khan  then recently converted  took him to  his own room  and reasoned with him till late at night  sabbath morning  found him not only fixed in his rebellion  but toiling to prevent  others coming to christ  at noon miss fiske went to the room where he  was   the two lower windows on the right of the engraving of the  seminary mark the place   he sat in the only chair there  and never  offered her a seat  so she stood by him  and tried to talk  but he  sternly repelled every attempt to speak of jesus  she then took his  hand  and said   deacon guwergis  i see you do not wish me to speak  with you  and i promise you that i will never do it again unless you  wish it  but pledge me one thing  when we stand together in judgment   and you are on the left hand  as you must be if you go on in your  present course  promise me that you will then testify  that on this  twenty second day of february        you were warned of your danger    he gave no pledge  but a weeping voice said   let me pray   the hand  was withdrawn  and he passed into the adjoining room  whence soon  issued a low voice  that miss fiske could hardly yet believe was  prayer  the bell rung for meeting  and she sent her precious charge  alone  while she staid to watch the man whose previous character and  conduct led her to fear that he was only feigning penitence in order to  plunder the premises undisturbed  she staid till a voice seemed to say   what doest thou here  elijah  then went and took her place in the  chapel  soon the door opened again very gently  and deacon guwergis  entered  but how changed  his gun and dagger were laid aside  the folds  of his turban had fallen over his forehead  his hands were raised to  his face  and the big tears fell in silence  he sank into the nearest  seat  and laid his head upon the desk  after mr  stoddard had  pronounced the blessing  miss fiske requested mr  stocking to see  deacon guwergis     he took him to his study  and there  in bitterness of soul  the recent  blasphemer cried out   o my sins  my sins  they are higher than the  mountains of jeloo    yes   said mr  stocking   but if the fires of  hell could be out  you would not be troubled  would you   the strong  man now bowed down in his agony  exclaiming   sir  even if there were  no hell  i could not bear this load of sin  i could not live as i have  lived      that night he could not sleep  in the morning  miss fiske begged mr   stoddard to see him  and after a short interview he returned  telling  her that the dreaded guwergis was sitting at the feet of jesus   my  great sins   and  my great saviour   was all that he could say  he was  subdued and humble  and before noon left for his mountain home  saying   as he left   i must tell my friends and neighbors of sin and of jesus    yet he trembled in view of his own weakness  and the temptations that  might befall him  nothing was heard from him for two weeks  when priest  eshoo was sent to his village  and found him in his own house  telling  his friends  of sin and of jesus   he had erected the family altar  and  at that moment was surrounded by a company weeping for their sins  so  changed was his whole character  and so earnest were his exhortations   that for a time some looked on him as insane  but the sight of his  meekness and forgiving love under despiteful usage amazed them  and  gave them an idea of vital piety they never had before  he returned to  oroomiah  bringing with him his wife  another child  and brother  and  soon found his way to miss fiske s room  as he opened the door  she  stood on the opposite side  but the tears were in his eyes  and  extending his hand as he approached  he said   i know you did not  believe me  but you will love me  will you not   and she did love him   and wondered at her own want of faith  in a few days  he was able to  tell mr  stocking  with holy joy  that two of his brothers were  anxiously seeking the way of life  his own growth in grace surprised  every one  and his views of salvation by grace were remarkably clear  and accurate     when his daughter returned to school  on the   th of march  she was  accompanied by one of her father s brothers  who seemed to have cast  away his own righteousness  and to rely on christ alone for pardon  as  no missionary had conversed with him  mr  stocking felt desirous to  know how he had been led into the kingdom  and learned that he had  promised deacon guwergis to spend the sabbath with one of the native  teachers of the female seminary  this teacher and others prayed with  him  till he threw away his dagger  saying   i have no more use for  this   and in tears cried out   what shall i do to be saved   he gave  no evidence then of having submitted to christ  but in his mountain  home he seemed to make a full surrender  and became well acquainted  with the mercy seat  the native helpers felt that he was moving  heavenward faster than themselves  in april  it was found that as many  as nine persons in hakkie  the village of deacon guwergis  gave  evidence of regeneration  five of them members of his own family  and  the whole village listened to the truth which the zealous deacon  constantly taught     he always remembered the school as his spiritual birthplace  and ever  loved to pray for it  once  when rising from his knees in the male  seminary  where he had been leading in evening devotion  he exclaimed    o god  forgive me  i forgot to pray for miss fiske s school   so he  knelt again and prayed for it  and mr  stoddard said he did not think  there was a smile on a single face  it was done with such manifest  simplicity and godly sincerity     in june        miss fiske visited hakkie with mr  and mrs  stocking  it  was the first time ladies had been in the mountains  and the good  deacon was greatly delighted  labors were then commenced for females  there that have been continued ever since  the annexed sketch will give  a more vivid idea of the nature of such labors than the most accurate  description  one day the party was toiling up a rough ascent  and the  deacon  as much at home among the rocks as the wild goats  offered his  assistance  the reply was   we get on very well   at once his eyes  filled  and he said   you once helped me in a worse road  may i not now  help you   and his aid was at once gratefully accepted  at the top of  the hill  while the party rested  they heard his voice far off among  the clefts of the rocks  pleading for them and their relatives in  distant america      illustration  missionary scene in teegawer      after his conversion  the deacon devoted himself to labors for souls   especially in the mountains  one might always see a tear and a smile on  his face  and he was ever ready  as at first  to speak  of sin and of  jesus   he traversed the mountains many times on foot  with his  testament and hymn book in his knapsack  in the rugged passes  he would  sing   rock of ages  cleft for me   and at the spring by the wayside    there is a fountain filled with blood  flowed spontaneously from his  lips  he warned every man  night and day  with tears  and pointed them  to jesus as their only hope  he rested from his labors march   th         and  as his mind wandered in the delirium of that brain fever  he  dwelt much on those days when he first learned the way to christ  he  would say   o  miss fiske was right when she pointed out that way   and  then he would shout   free grace  free grace   till he sunk away  unconscious  again he would say   that blessed mr  stocking  o  it was  free grace   these were almost his last words  the daughter who prayed  with him that first saturday was by his dying bed  and her voice in  prayer was the last earthly sound that fell upon his ear     it may strike the reader as strange that a man so notorious for  wickedness as deacon guwergis was  should be allowed in the seminary   but oriental notions of hospitality are widely different from ours  and  in order to do good to a people  however rude  they must feel that you  are their friend  no protection from government can take the place of  this feeling of affectionate confidence from the people  and while  sufficient help was at hand to repel any overt wickedness  the highest  usefulness required that patient love should have its perfect work  and  in this case  at least  its labor was not unrewarded     the usefulness of the seminary among the relatives of its pupils was  illustrated in another case that occurred about the same time  march   d        the father of one of the girls called and inquired  with  tears  if his daughter was troubled for her sins  surprised at such an  inquiry from a notorious drunkard  he was exhorted to seek his own  salvation  he then told how he had been taught the plague of his own  heart  and  as a ruined sinner  was clinging to christ alone  his  prayers showed that he was no stranger at the throne of grace  father  and daughter spent the evening mingling their supplications and tears  before the mercy seat  the daughter had given more trouble than any in  school  and several times had almost been sent away  four days later   her mother came  and remained several days  almost the whole time in  tears  and hardly speaking  except to pray  her daughter and the pious  members of the school were unwilling to let her go till she came to  christ  and she seemed to take him for her saviour before she left  she  was a sister of priest abraham  and had been so exceedingly clamorous  and profane in her opposition to religion  that her brother had for  years dreaded to see her  how did he rejoice  when  instead of the  customary oath  he found her uttering the praises of her saviour  the  sister of her husband had been one of the vainest of the vain  wearing  an amount of ornament unusual even for a nestorian  but she no sooner  put on the righteousness of christ than she sold her ornaments  and   giving the proceeds to the poor  clothed herself with that modest  apparel which becometh women professing godliness  the husband himself   though an illiterate laborer  preached the gospel while at work in the  field  and often took two or three of his associates aside to pray with  them  and to tell them of christ and his salvation     but these cases must suffice  we can only indicate the ways in which  the school became a centre of holy influence  especially for woman  but  it is impossible to narrate all the facts     after the revival  the seminary was thronged with visitors  who desired  the time to be filled up with religious instruction  that year  witnessed a rich ingathering of wives and mothers  brought by their  converted husbands and children to be taught the way of salvation  the  teacher who received visitors always found enough to do both by day and  by night  as soon as there were two praying women in a village  miss  fiske and miss rice sought to establish female prayer meetings  and  when they visited a village  the women expected to be called together  for prayer  and when the women returned the visit  they each sought to  be prayed and conversed with alone  this was done also with the  communicants generally three times a year  the prayers and remarks of  the pious members of the school often gave a high spiritual tone to the  weekly prayer meeting  occasionally there were maternal meetings  and  on such occasions one teacher met with the mothers  and the other with  the children in a separate room     these took the place of the early meetings with women mentioned in the  beginning of the chapter  and were very useful     nestorian families have been already described in part  but the absence  of the religious element in them can hardly be realized by christians  here  they did not believe that a child was possessed of a soul until  it was forty days old  this belief affected all their feelings towards  children  and their custom of burying unbaptized infants outside of  their cemeteries did not serve to correct such impressions     family registers were unknown  in       probably not five nestorians  could tell their birthday  and but few knew in what year they were  born  miss fiske kept a list of all the children  which was read at  every meeting  but at first she could record the birth of only the very  youngest  the deceased children were written down in a separate page   and it was sad to see how much they exceeded the number of the living   one childless mother  who had buried eleven  was always present  for  she said she wanted to pray for the children of others  though her own  were not  they assembled in miss fiske s room  sometimes to the number  of thirty  with  such of their little ones as were too small to attend  the other meeting  and  seated on the floor around her  were never more  happy than when telling their troubles  asking questions  and receiving  instructions about family duties  much more specific than could be  given on other occasions  now and then she read to them  from english  books  facts and truths adapted to their needs  one good man in  fairhaven  connecticut  who had heard of this  sent a complete set of  the mother s magazine  to be used in that way  so interested were they   that many of them walked regularly three miles and back again  under a  burning sun  to enjoy these gatherings  and from a monthly  it had to  be changed to a weekly meeting  it sometimes lasted three hours  but  never seemed to them too long  and  commenced in       it is still kept  up with as much regularity as miss rice s many other duties will allow   it would be interesting to dwell on its results  but a single incident  may suffice  one mother  whose husband was not a christian  was very  regular in private devotion  but thought she could not offer prayer in  the family  till her husband became dangerously sick  when  in the  agony of her intercession for him  she vowed that  if god would spare  him  she would establish family prayer  so  as soon as he was able to  bear it  she gathered her children around his bed  and after they had  read the first chapter of matthew  verse about  she led in prayer  and  so went on reading the new testament in the morning and the old  testament in the evening  till she got through with the whole of the  former  before any one of the missionaries knew that she had commenced     the teachers of the seminary enjoyed very much the visits of the early  inquirers from geog tapa  in the summer of       most of whom became  hopefully pious the following winter  let us look in on one visit made  towards the end of may  a pupil announces that two women below wish to  see miss fiske  and a middle aged stranger is shown into her room  in  answer to the usual inquiry   from whence do you come   she replies   i  have come from geog tapa  for i have heard that you have repented  and  i want to know about it   she has walked six miles on purpose to make  the inquiry   i wish that you  too  had repented   calls forth the  reply   alas  i have not  i am on my way to destruction   feeling that  the bible was the safest guide for such an inquirer  miss fiske reads  appropriate portions  explaining as she reads  the visitor shows a  great deal of bible knowledge for one who cannot read  indicating that  she had not been inattentive to the faithful instructions of priest  abraham and deacon john  and her questions are numerous and intensely  practical  among other things  she asked   is it true  that for one sin  adam and eve were cast out of eden   and on being told that it was so    there   said she  turning to the unconcerned neighbor  who had come  with her   do you hear that  what will become of you and me  who have  sinned so often   at length prayer was proposed  to which she eagerly  and tearfully assented  and though the tongue that commended her to  jesus  in that strange language  might have faltered  the heart did not  share in the embarrassment  the woman  like the first inquirer   repeated every word of the prayer in a low whisper  as though unwilling  to lose a single syllable  the conversation was then resumed till it  was interrupted by the entrance of some of the pupils on business    have you finished   was the woman s eager inquiry   i wish very much  to hear more of these things   her companion now begged her to go home    no   was the kind reply   you may go  but i must stay here to  prayers   evening prayers were earlier than usual that evening for her  sake  but still she lingered  she had not yet found rest  selby  one of  mrs  grant s pupils  then in the seminary  now conversed with her  and  as there seemed to be a sympathy between them  selby had recently found  peace in believing   they were left by themselves  after supper  selby  remained with her an hour or more  that they might pray together  till  it was quite dark  and her friends had sent for her repeatedly  she  left  having first begged permission to come in to morning prayers   morning came  and before sunrise she was again listening intently to  the reading of the word  and  after devotions  left for home  earnestly  begging miss fiske to come and spend a week in geog tapa     the seminary was dismissed june  th  on that day  several hundreds of  the parents and friends of the pupils  in both seminaries  were invited  to a simple entertainment  got up in native style  the gentlemen of the  mission ate in one room  with the men and boys  and the ladies in  another  with their own sex  the confidence and kind feeling manifested  by all towards the school was very gratifying  after dinner  the whole  company  seated in the court  listened to an address from mr  holladay   then about to return home  he spoke to parents and children on their  duties  privileges  and responsibilities  towards the close  he spoke  of the almost certainty of never meeting them again till the judgment   and bade them an affectionate farewell  his utterance was often choked   and his hearers wept  and well they might  for in him they parted with  a faithful friend  during the exercises  the members of the two schools  sang  twice  to the great gratification of their friends     that evening most of the pupils went home  all but a few of the girls  carrying with them a copy of the four gospels  in modern syriac  which  they had paid for with their needles     miss fiske left for geog tapa on the   th of june with mr  stocking   reaching that place as the people were coming out from evening prayers  in the church  the first to welcome them were six pupils  residents in  the village  who greeted their teacher with a hearty good will  next to  them came pareza  the inquirer  changed somewhat in her feelings  but  with no loss of religious interest  john  too  was there  the native  pastor   he had been busy  day and night  instructing the people  and  had taken special care of the pupils  that they might both improve  themselves and exert a good influence on others  when mr  stocking  asked him about matters in the village   o sir   said he   it is a very  good time here now  very many love to hear the truth  their hearts are  very open  o sir  i have very much hope   after supper  the villagers  poured into the room for a meeting  to the number of one hundred  while  some thirty or forty more were unable to get in  this was all the more  welcome  as no notice whatever had been given  it was a clear moonlight  evening  and the groups outside were distinctly visible  through the  latticed side of the room  john commenced with an earnest prayer for a  blessing on the evening  asking  in his simplicity  that  the people  might run after the word like sheep after salt   a strange expression  to us  but most appropriate and striking there  fixed attention was  given to mr  stocking s discourse  then john  who feared that those  around the door had not been fed  spoke to them of zaccheus   the crowd  about him   said he   did not know his feelings  but jesus knew them   and loved him  and so  mothers and sisters   they  as an inferior  class  had to take the lowest places while the men were within   if you  have come here to night with a broken heart  though we have not seen  you  jesus has   he then  with miss fiske s pupils  sung a hymn  and  the meeting closed  still  many women lingered  some sitting down by  miss fiske  and others in little groups  talking over what they had  heard  very different from previous visits  when dress and such things  were the most interesting themes of conversation  this was the first  meeting in the village in which the missionaries noticed much religious  interest     early in the morning  miss fiske s pupils were gathered together for a  bible class  the women soon filled the room  the exercise continued all  the forenoon  simply because it could not be closed  it was impossible  to send away unfed those who hungered for the word  among the women  were a few men  one of them the husband of the inquirer  he was asked    have you and your wife chosen the good part   he covered his face for  a moment  the tears rolled down his cheeks  and then he said   by the  grace of god  i hope we have   his heart was too full to say more     soon after noon  mr  stocking preached in the church  on the barren fig  tree  to a crowded assembly  the heat and the multitude made the place  very uncomfortable  but the interest deepened till the close  as soon  as they were out of the church  many women crowded around miss fiske   some of whom she could look on as truly pious  and more as thoughtful   one  who was the first to be awakened about a year before  seemed now a  growing christian  on leaving  she said   perhaps i shall not see you  again till i meet you in heaven   she seemed to be looking forward with  humble hope to a sinless home  with others  she had encountered much  opposition from her family and friends  she has since entered into rest     on the   th  selby visited miss fiske  and in answer to a question  about a place for private devotion   o  yes   said she   there is a  deep hole under our house  like a cellar  and there i go every day to  pray      a brief account of her may not here be out of place  in       when she  was an infant in her mother s arms  the cholera in five days carried  her father and five of his household to the grave  in       she was one  of the first pupils of mrs  grant  she learned more rapidly than the  rest  and yet was so amiable that she was loved by those whom she  excelled  still  she was a stranger to god  and she felt it  when  thirteen years of age  her brother took her out of school  replying to  her earnest pleadings  to be allowed to remain   you have been there  already too long   at the same time she was forced to marry a boy  twelve years of age  with whom she had never spoken  for days  previously  tears were her meat and drink  nor was she the only one  that wept  after this  the missionaries seldom saw her  till  one cold  sabbath in the winter of          a girl entered the chapel  wrapped   as brides usually are  in a large  white sheet  she was not recognized   of course  till her mother led her forward  saying   i have brought  selby here to day to listen to the words of god  she loves them and you  very much   she was feeble and much depressed  and expressed a strong  desire to return to school  her father in law consented to her teaching  in the primary department  on condition that her husband was received  into the boys  seminary  which was done  she now manifested much  interest in religion  and one day wept much  and inclined to be alone   the next evening  she went to miss fiske  distressed with a sense of  sin  said she   i have lied  and stolen  and sworn  nor that only  but  have lived so long without once loving my kind  heavenly father  when i  felt sadly about dying at home  i thought then only of hell  but now my  sins  o  how many they are  i never knew before that i was such a  sinner   the next day  at her father in law s request  she was to spend  the sabbath at home  she was very loath to go  but it was not thought  best to try to retain her  and she went  there she found neither closet  nor christian friend  and the house was full of guests from morning  till night  whom  she was required to entertain  yet in the morning she  returned with even increased interest in spiritual things  said she    two or three times i was left alone for a moment  and then i tried to  commit my soul to my saviour   those few moments she seemed to value  above all price  not long after  she found peace in jesus  who became  her chosen theme  no wonder she loved to point others also to the lamb  of god  and lead them to the mercy seat           chapter x       geog tapa     deacon murad khan in        pentecostal sabbath in        meetings in       and        extracts from journal of yonan in          the village of geog tapa is so prominent  and has been so largely  blessed  that  though there is not room for a continuous account of the  work in that place  we here give a glimpse of its progress in different  years     deacon murad khan  one of the assistants in the seminary  and a native  of the place  spent some sabbaths there in may        he took turns  with the other native teacher in this  going saturday  and returning on  monday  he tells us that  after morning prayers in the church  pious  men met together to pray for a blessing on the day  twelve of their  number then went to labor in other villages  the rest remaining to work  at home  passing through a vineyard  he found hidden among the vines a  youth setting home gospel truth to a group of others about his own age   at their request  he expounded the parable of the ten virgins to them  till it was time for forenoon service  then they separated  to spend a  few moments in private devotion before entering the church     in       the pious men of the village divided it into districts  and  visited from house to house for religious conversation and prayer   meetings were held daily  and well attended  the most abandoned persons  were hopefully converted  crimes committed twenty five years before  were confessed  and restitution made  one sabbath in february  mr   stocking and mar yohanan found a large assembly in the house of mar  elias  listening to an exhortation from priest abraham  mar yohanan   who had not been there since his conversion a little while before  was  then called on  and spoke of himself as the chief of sinners  having  led more souls to destruction than any other of his people  and being  all covered with their blood  in regard to his flock he said  the  fattest he had eaten  the poorest he had cast away  the lame and the  sick he had neglected  he begged them no longer to look to their  bishops for salvation  but to repent at once and turn to god  priest  abraham  then recently awakened  also made a humble confession of his  sins as their priest  and besought them  one and all  to attend to the  salvation of their souls     in the afternoon  the church was crowded  and a number  unable to gain  admission  retired to a school room  where a meeting was conducted by a  member of the male seminary  in the church  they sung the hymn   come   holy spirit  heavenly dove   mar yohanan offered prayer  and mr   stocking preached from the text   now  then  we are ambassadors for  christ   and produced a very deep impression  which was increased by  short addresses from the bishop and others  this was known afterwards  by the name of the pentecostal sabbath     in       those previously renewed gained new light  and those whose  piety was doubtful  to use deacon john s broken english  were  very  much firmed   miss fiske and miss rice spent a day in the village   after the close of their spring term  and had delightful intercourse  with about twenty women hopefully pious  and many more inquirers  in  the evening  supper was hurried through  and men  women  and children  hastened to the house of the pastor  mr  stocking preached there to a  crowded assembly of men  while the teachers adjourned to a neighboring  house  to meet with the women  their hearts were full at meeting so  many for whom they had alternately hoped and feared  now sitting in  heavenly places in christ jesus  they remembered seeing their first  penitential tears  and could hardly restrain their own for joy  the  house was full  and in a silence interrupted only by stifled sobs  they  communed together concerning jesus and his grace  it seemed as though  god perfected praise that night out of the mouths of babes  by keeping  them perfectly still in their mothers  aims  and as the pupils of the  seminary belonging to the village  in their prayers  laid mothers   sisters  and friends at the feet of jesus  the place seemed near to  heaven  next day  about one hundred and fifty attended another meeting   and it was with difficulty the teachers could tear themselves away  one  of the pious mothers could not bear to have her daughter  recently  converted in the seminary  leave her sight  and more than once a day  they bowed together at the throne of grace  when this mother met miss  fiske her feelings were so intense she could only say   thank god    over and over  and weep  her husband was moved by his child s anxiety  for his salvation  once  when she urged him to pray  he replied   i  cannot  but you may pray for me   she at once knelt and interceded for  him  with many tears  the gray headed man knelt also  deeply moved  and  tears flowed from eyes not used to weep  when she ceased praying  she  rose  but his strength was gone  he could not rise  yet the love of the  world was strong within him  and it is to be feared that he resisted  the holy ghost     in       miss fiske found about sixty families maintaining family  prayer  and hardly a family in which there was not some one that seemed  to be a true disciple  john held a prayer meeting sabbath morning with  those whom he sent out  two and two  to preach in the neighboring  villages  and in the evening they reported what they had done  sabbath  school commenced about nine o clock  and before it opened  almost all  were reading or listening to those that read  and then the school  continued in session two hours  without a sign of weariness  the number  wishing to learn to read was so large that it was difficult to provide  for them  men came begging good teachers for their wives  and women  came pleading for spelling books for their husbands  after school  at  their own request  miss fiske met twenty one girls  who had been  members of her school  twenty of them now teachers in the sabbath  school   and gave them a word of counsel and encouragement in their  work  at the close of afternoon service  the women who could read staid  with her till near sunset  they never so thankful before  and she never  more thankful to be with them     the next glimpse we take of geog tapa shall be from a native  standpoint  a young man of the village  possessed of more than ordinary  abilities  was early taken into the male seminary  his influence over  the rest was so great  and so decidedly opposed to religion  that he  was about to be sent away  when grace made him the first fruit of the  revival in       yonan  for that is his name  was a teacher in the  female seminary from      till       and  as he was generally  accustomed to spend his sabbaths in his native village  on monday  morning he handed in to miss fiske a written report of the labors of  the previous day  and from  these we now give some extracts         january   th         i had a pleasant time in morning family prayer   at which several young persons were present  the sabbath school was  followed by a meeting  at the close of which i returned to my room with  four young men  i talked with them about two hours  first about coming  to church   for they attend only occasionally   and in this they  promised to do better  i then questioned until i reached their inmost  souls  i asked one   what is the distance between you and god    my  teacher  there is a very great distance between us    is it god s  fault  or yours    it is mine   i then looked on another  noted for his  wickedness  and said   beloved  did not christ come for you  his  stripes  his anguish  his crucifixion   were they not for you  why   then  treat him so ill  has he left the least thing undone for you   he  admitted the truth  but seemed like a rock  at length i said to them    now  satan has provided something or somebody outside the door  to  drive these thoughts from your hearts   one replied   true  satan has  let down all the nets of the sea of ardishai    for us   i prayed for  them  and they left me  serious  then i prayed for them alone  soon my  little sister raheel came in  who is under papal influence  i talked  with her about prayer to the saints  and opened to the ten  commandments  and began to read  but she did not want to hear  my heart  yearned over my poor sister  and i prayed with her   footnote    lake  of oroomiah       moses preached in the afternoon about achan  and after that i had my  usual meeting with the pious women  guly returned with me for  conversation  i think she is a blessed christian  she labors and prays  with two of her companions  she told how her cousin ridiculed her  and  i encouraged her to go forward  but said   if all the world think you a  christian  don t rest till you can say   i know in whom i have  believed    we prayed together  and o  what a prayer she offered   deacon siyad led the evening meeting       january   th   after morning service  i took baba khan and guwergis  to my room  the first i had labored with last year  and thought him  interested  his wife fears god  and has often asked me to talk with  him  he is seldom absent from church or prayer meeting  and often goes  out with our young men when they preach  this was my thought in talking  with him   near the kingdom  but not in it   i earnestly pressed these  questions  what do you think of yourself  what is your dependence for  salvation  have you repented  in short  on which side are you  he was  troubled  tears ran down his cheeks  and for a time he made no reply   at last he said   i cannot tell   a companion began to answer for him   with the confidence of ignorance  judging christians and finding holes  in the coats of the righteous   who knows whether a man is a christian   god alone   i said   are there any christians in our village    yes     then you know some as christians   his words were many  while baba  khan s were few  my father here came in  but i prayed with them all   and then went to church  where i preached from the words   and thou  mourn at the last       to day i conversed with sadee  i found her in the habit of praying  with her sisters in christ one by one  i advised her to try and lead  some of her unconverted neighbors to christ by her labors and prayers   she promised to do so  we spent more than an hour speaking the language  of canaan  and then knelt at the feet of the saviour whom we love  she  prayed  spreading out her hands to heaven  as i think the early saints  used to do  and it seemed as though god would fill us with blessing in  answer to that prayer  she left me alone  and thanking god for these  blessed opportunities to labor       january   st   after meeting  conversed with munny  daughter of  mukdesseh  it was profitable to talk with her  she said that her  sainted mother used to say   when  my heart is cold  i go to christ   and never rise from my knees till he warms it   she has some hope for  her husband  and also fear  since he does not forsake wine  she told of  a woman for whom she had prayed and labored five or six years  and  promised to do so with others  o  what a sweet savor of piety did i  receive from her  if we had many such mothers in geog tapa how changed  it would be  i cannot write all our pleasant words  they remain for  eternity       february  th   i took home from sabbath school two young men  for  whom i have fears because they drink too much wine  i talked long with  them  not as though i would take a pledge from them  or that it is a  sin ever to drink at all  for i thought this would not be profitable   but i asked them questions  that they might themselves distinguish what  is right  as   does wine make you to sin   they owned that it did   their hearts seemed won to the right  but the work is the lord s  may  he save them from this temptation      in the afternoon  i began to talk with sanum without feeling  but  ended in tears  i did not ask questions  but carefully explained the  difficulties and the fight of faith  also the special grace of god to  his people  when i said to her   i want you to enlarge your heart  and  take in one more besides the two women whom you now labor with   she  selected a very ignorant one  i am afraid that i do differently   seeking rather an easy work       february   d   this afternoon i sent for nargis  i had never thought  of her as a christian  but i found that i was greatly mistaken  it is  all my own fault  i had seldom met her  and never prayed with her  i  commenced   do you think yourself a christian    i do    how long have  you thought so    about eight years    how is it that i have not known  it    yakob was my pastor  and since he left i have had none   then she  told of her awakening  and sufferings for christ s sake  between her  betrothal and her marriage   i used to go to evening meetings with  yakob  and on my return my uncle would take me by the braids of my hair  and throw me on the ground  saying   you go because there are young men  there   sometimes i found the door barred against me  then i went to a  neighbor s to lodge  or oftener to the stable  and slept in a manger   but i was never afraid  for christ was with me  for a time my betrothed  wished to put me away  it was then i found christ  and i have never  forsaken him since   she is now poor and in distress  she attends  church and sabbath school  but cannot go to evening meeting  as her two  little children keep her at home  she lamented this  not thinking that  she could serve christ in the care of these little ones  i told her   i  preach that prayer and the care of children are equally a duty   she  was greatly comforted  these words seemed like oil poured into the  flickering lamp  i gave her the  green pastures   and prayed with her   i have great confidence in her piety      on friday forenoon  i saw martha  the wife of eshoo  i trust she has  grace in her heart  and her husband hopes that he is a christian  but  looks after her more than himself  she sees him not doing right  and  tells him in love  he is not pleased  still  she thinks him a  christian  she wished i would talk to them together  that their path  might be one  i told her i did not think it best that she should talk  much to him  but be very quiet  pray for him  be obedient to him  and  hope to win him by her chaste conversation coupled with fear  she  received my words well       february   th   i talked with moressa  we hoped  seven or eight years  ago  that she was a christian  but her husband soon prevented her  attending meeting  and so she remained  till lately she came to church  again  i did not know that one of the sisters in christ had prayed  regularly with her all this while  but supposed that she had gone back  to her dead forms  and that god moved me to call her to repentance  but  i found her trusting that she had been set in christ s breastplate  the  light of which can never go out  i said   do you think you love the  saviour    yes  as the apple of my eye    are you sure that you have  not forsaken him in all these years    i have been very sinful all the  time  but do not think i have taken my hand from christ   my heart was  now drawn towards her  i said   moressa  forgive me  i have been an  unfaithful shepherd  i have not once searched for you  i confess my  faults    i have faults  i have been a wandering sheep  forsaking the  fold    have you kept up secret prayer during all these years    i  have   i found that she had learned to read at home  and i gave her a  testament  i have a good hope for her  but how negligent i have been   there may be many christians unknown      these extracts might be extended  but enough have been given to  illustrate the inner workings of nestorian piety  and the labors of  those so appropriately called  native helpers   it was such men that  paul called his helpers in christ jesus     the women of geog tapa  in a letter to miss fiske  written feb         thanking her for her labors among them  say   we often think  what are  we more than the women of other nations  that we should have such  heavenly blessings  and are ready to cry  blessed is the dust of the  land that sends forth such good news  and makes known the way of life  to the world   they add  that at their last communion more than eighty  souls sat down at the lord s table  and it seemed as if he who sitteth  between the cherubim was present in the church           chapter xi       revival in          preparatory work   sanctified afflictions   name for revival   scenes  in ihe

in  the desert  yet  as such a fountain  though springing full grown from  the earth  is connected with unseen arrangements working out that  visible result  so was this revival connected with an extended process  of preparation  for years there had been a laborious inculcation of  divine truth  especially in the seminary  true  there had been few  conversions  but those few were an essential part of the preparatory  work  the roots of this revival extended back as far as the conversion  of deacon john  in       even in those still unconverted  there had  been a wonderful preparation of the way of the lord  no one could  compare the condition of the places yet unblessed by missionary labor   with those so favored  and not feel this  religious education had made  a marked improvement in the appearance of the pupils of both  seminaries  in their personal habits  their intelligence  and  especially in their knowledge of the doctrines of the gospel  old  superstitions had lost their hold  they could no longer trust in fasts  and ceremonies  and they had an intellectual understanding of the way  of salvation through a redeemer  true  all this did not necessarily  involve a spiritual work  but god is pleased to have the way thus  prepared for that spirit who sanctifies through the truth  those who  had received the most instruction were the first to come to christ  and  have since lived the more consistent christian life     then  in the good providence of him who always observes a beautiful  order in the manifestations of his grace  other influences tended to  the same result  the very delay of the blessing called forth earnest  prayer from the husbandmen who were waiting for precious fruit  and had  long patience for it  till they received the early and the latter rain   the trials which the missionaries had passed through in      also  tended to produce that despair of help from themselves which usually  precedes blessing  in      they numbered sixteen souls  but in        from various causes  they were diminished to ten  these were not  discouraged  but remained at their post confident that labors in the  lord cannot be in vain  then the persecution under mar shimon shut them  up to god as their only hope  while it rid them of some native helpers   who cared chiefly for their own temporal advantage  the army of gideon   on all sides  was being diminished in order to secure obedience to that  precept   he that glorieth  let him glory in the lord   the feeling was  general   all our springs are in god   one of the missionaries said  in  the autumn of        god never formed a soul that christ cannot redeem  from the power of sin  i know this people are sunk in sin and  degradation  but jesus died to save them  and we may see them forever  stars in his crown of rejoicing  if we are only humble and faithful  enough to lead them to the saviour      at the time of the revival  dr  and mrs  perkins resided at seir  and  dr  and mrs  wright were temporarily with them in that village  mr   breath was in the city  but using the turkish mainly  he never ventured  to give religious instruction in syriac  so that mr  stocking and mr   stoddard were the only laborers in oroomiah  they lived on the mission  premises already described  and at that time the male seminary occupied  a building in the same enclosure     one day in the autumn of       mr  stocking  miss fiske  and deacon  john were riding together  when john asked in english   if we ever have  a revival here  what shall we call it   mr  stocking replied   let us  get it first  then we will find a name   and when it did come  the  pious nestorians at once called it  an awakening      towards the close of december  mr  stocking noticed repeated  indications of deep seriousness among the pupils of mr  stoddard  and  felt that they were on the eve of a revival  about the same time   deacon john was more active in labor  and earnest in prayer  in the  seminaries  the teachers did not think so much of what their pupils  were  as of the power of god to make them like himself  they labored in  hope  expecting a blessing  but it came sooner than they looked for   and in larger measure  the first monday of the new year  january  th   was spent as a day of fasting and prayer  and the missionaries had just  begun to pray  when they found that some were praying for themselves   miss fiske went into her school  as usual  at nine o clock  and  after  telling her flock that many prayers were being offered for them that  day in a distant land  led their morning devotions  and then sent them  into another room to study with a native teacher  sanum and sarah  lingered behind the rest  and as they drew near  she asked   did you  not understand me   they made no reply  and she saw they were weeping    have you had bad news   still no reply  but when they got near enough   they whispered   may we have to day to care for our souls   and sarah  added   perhaps next year i shall not be here   there was no private  room to give them  but they made a closet for themselves among the fuel  in the wood cellar  and there spent that day looking unto jesus  nor  did they look in vain  their teacher did not know where they had gone   till  long after one of them had died  the survivor gave her an account  of that memorable day     on sabbath evening  january   th  the words at the english prayer  meeting were few  but the prayers carried the dear pupils and laid them  at the feet of jesus  at the close of the meeting  mr  stoddard was  lighting his candle to go home  when mr  stocking asked if he saw any  indications of interest in his school  there was no reply  but the  expressive face  and the candle dropping unnoticed as he held it   showed that thought was busy  and the heart full  at length he said   with deep feeling   i should expect to see interest if we felt as we  ought to feel   and passed out  all were impressed with his manner  so  earnest  yet so humble  he retired to his study  called john  and  talked with him on the state of the school  he proposed that they  should each day make some one pupil a subject of special prayer and  personal effort  and begin that night with yakob of sooldooz  they  prayed together for him  and then he said   john  i want to talk with  him to night  we don t know what may be on the morrow  go and call  him   yakob  who had acted badly in meeting that day  came  expecting  to be punished  but when mr  stoddard kindly asked him to come and sit  down by him  and  taking his hand  said   have you ever thought that  you have a soul to be saved or lost   he broke down at once  he  confessed that the whole school had combined to shut out the subject  from their thoughts  but really felt so uneasy  that if one of them  should be brought to christ he thought all would follow  then the good  man  who was so distressed that day because he could see no impression  made by the sermon  thanked god and took courage  not willing to devote  monday to yakob alone  he conversed with another of the same name  and  he too went away weeping to his closet  the two had been in the  recitation room but a little while before their feelings became so  intense that they had to ask leave to retire   it is god    it is god    was whispered from seat to seat  and at noon a group collected to  discuss what was to be done  one proposed to rise up against the work   and put it down  but at length yonan of geog tapa said   i don t want  to be a christian  i don t mean to be  but i am afraid to oppose this   we had better let it alone  if it is god s work we cannot put it down   and if it is man s work it will come to nought without our  interference   nothing more was said  but before school commenced that  afternoon  some of those boys were on their knees in prayer     in the evening  mr  stoddard sent for two leaders in the opposition   very promising scholars  but of late forward in every thing that was  evil  one of them this yonan  and as he himself told afterwards   mr   stoddard said   if you do not wish to be saved yourselves  i beg of  you  from my inmost soul  not to hinder others   and eternity so opened  up before me  that i was ready to be swallowed up  i longed for some  one to speak to me of the way of escape  but no such word was spoken to  me that night  i could not sleep  for i was almost sure there was but a  step between me and death   late on thursday evening  the other yonan   of ada  came to mr  stoddard in extreme agitation  who conversed with  him a while  and then left him there to pray alone  that night he too  could not sleep  the years he had spent in sin rose up before him in  the light of god  and filled him with anguish  but next morning  in  conversing with mr  stoddard  he seemed to find rest in submitting to  sovereign mercy     on monday evening  the indications of interest in the female seminary  were such  that the teacher invited those disposed to seek salvation at  once  to come to her room at five o clock  before that hour  a number  had retired to pray for themselves  just then  mr  stoddard came to the  door of the teacher  saying   i cannot stop  but i wanted you to know  that four or five of my boys are much distressed for their sins   this  was the first intimation she had of what was taking place in the other  school  and she turned away from mr  stoddard to find five of her  pupils in the same condition  mr  stoddard came in again  in the course  of the evening  to pray and consult  and mr  stocking gave up every  thing else to labor with the pupils in both schools  both dr  perkins  and dr  wright came down frequently from seir  every day brought out  new cases of those who were being taught of god  wednesday evening  at  the conclusion of a sermon from mr  stocking  on the words   behold  i  stand at the door and knock   no member of the male seminary seemed  willing to leave his seat  after a few words of exhortation  they were  dismissed to their rooms  but so intense were their feelings that they  came in crowds to the teacher s study  where he preached jesus christ   and forgiveness through his blood  till near midnight  then  fatigued  and exhausted  he retired to rest  thursday evening  in the english  prayer meeting  mr  stoddard said   god will assuredly carry forward  his own work  let us give ourselves up to labor for him  in pointing  these precious souls to christ   after the meeting  the teachers of  both seminaries left to engage in that blessed work till midnight   eleven years after  on the same evening  and about the same hour  one  was called to see the other pass from earth into the presence of the  saviour whom he then set forth so faithfully  no wonder the survivor  recalled it in the hush of that parting scene     it is difficult to describe the occurrences of this eventful week  the  teachers  rooms were in such demand as closets for the pupils  that  they could hardly command them long enough for their own devotions   they were ready to write  immanuel  on every thing around them  the  girls were very free to express their feelings  and they had such  perfect confidence in their teacher  that often  during the revival   some of them woke her in the morning  standing at her bedside  with  some inquiry about the way of life     the two schools hardly knew any thing of each other till friday  evening  when they met in a room fitted up for the female seminary the  preceding autumn  the first time mr  stoddard entered it after this  he  looked round  and said   may this room be wholly consecrated to the  lord forever   and this evening christ seemed to take possession of it   the boys sat on one side  and the girls on the other  and seldom   perhaps  has there been a company more under the influence of things  unseen  it seemed as though god himself spoke that evening through his  ministering servants  and this and that one was born there and then  it  was in the same room that that last prayer meeting of the teacher with  her former pupils was held  july   th        in the engraving  the two  upper windows  immediately to the left of the small ones over the  central door  belong to this room     at the close of the week  ten of the pupils were trusting in christ   and of the next lord s day it might truly be said   that sabbath was an  high day   for the lord was present  and many strong men bowed before  him  priest eshoo had watched the boys  he had watched his own praying  sarah  and now he looked within  he had never been known to weep  he  scorned such weakness  but when  at the close of the afternoon service   mr  stocking took his hand  saying   be sure you are on the right  foundation   he buried his face in his handkerchief and wept aloud  nor  did he weep alone  deacon tamo  too   whose levity all through the week  had been a sore trial to mr  stoddard  so that he had asked   can it be  that god has let him come here to hinder the work    now trembled from  head to foot  mr  stoddard prayed with him  and as they rose from their  knees  tamo looked him in the face  and  with streaming eyes  said    thank you  thank you for caring for my soul      during the following week  most of the inmates of both seminaries were  deeply convinced of sin  and daily some souls seemed to come to the  saviour     but some things rendered it apparent that the interest was not all from  above  one evening  fifteen or twenty boys were found rolling on the  floor  groaning and crying for mercy  measures were taken at once to  prevent the repetition of such a scene  and at evening prayers mr   stocking commenced his remarks by asking if any of them had ever seen  the nazloo river  at marbeeshoo  near its source  startled by what  seemed a very untimely question  a few answered   yes    was there much  water in it   wondering what he could mean  the answer was   no  very  little    did it make much noise    yes  a great deal   the catechist  went on   have you seen the same river on the plain   by this time   every ear was listening  and all replied   yes    was it deep and  wide    yes  it was full of water    and was it more noisy than at  marbeeshoo    no  it was very quiet and still   the parable was now  applied very faithfully  he said that he had hoped the holy spirit had  been teaching them the evil of their hearts  but their noise and  confusion that evening showed him that there was no depth to their  experience  the effect was wonderful  they hung their heads and quietly  dispersed  and from many a closet that night might have been heard the  petition   lord  make me to know my heart  and let me not be like that  noisy river   what threatened to be an uncontrollable excitement became  at once a quiet but deep sense of guilt  their desires were not less  intense  but more spiritual  their consciences were very tender  and  their feelings contrite  but subdued and gentle     in this revival  the converts had a great deal of feeling  but no  knowledge of the mode in which such feelings find expression in  christian lands  and in the freshness and strength of their emotions  they yielded to every impulse with an unconscious simplicity that was  exceedingly interesting  if they were under conviction of sin  that  found immediate and unrestrained utterance  if they thought they were  forgiven  that  too  at once found expression  there was a wonderful  transparency of spirit that revealed each varying aspect of their  feelings  and withal a tendency to undue excitement that needed careful  handling  indeed  it was found necessary to watch their social meetings  very closely  and sometimes to direct them to pray alone     for three weeks  very few visitors came to the seminary  the time  seemed to be given expressly for the benefit of the pupils  and it was  like one continual sabbath  every corner was consecrated to prayer  and  most of the work was direct effort for the salvation of souls  but  after that  visitors began to come  and then the young converts became  helpers in christ jesus  even the sight of their devotion turning the  thoughts of others to spiritual things  often ten or fifteen women  spent the night on the premises  and at such times  all the spare  bedding was brought into the great room  which was transformed into a  dormitory  the teacher often staid with them till midnight  and then   from her own room  could hear them praying the rest of the night  in  connection with this  one incident claims our notice  one day in  february  a box arrived from america for the seminary  but so engrossed  was the teacher with more important duties  that it was midnight ere  she could open it  next morning  all were invited to her room  to see  the contents  she told of the kind friends who had sent it  and the  love of christ  that constrained to such kindness  they were moved to  tears  but not one rose to examine the things  and not a word was  spoken  till the proposal was made that the quilts should be kept for  the use of their friends who came to hear the word of god  all joyfully  agreed to that  and then  after looking at the articles  they returned  to pray for their benefactors     the last meetings of the school before the march vacation were called  thanksgivings  and fitly  too  for in the two seminaries as many as  fifty souls had begun to love the saviour  when they left  the  universal cry was   pray for us    pray for us in the temptations that  await us at home   one little girl said   did you ever see a new born  lamb cast into the snow and live  and can we live   thank god  most of  the hopeful converts did live  and we trust are to live forever  with  the good shepherd who gave his life for their salvation     it does not fall in with the design of this volume to give a complete  account of the revival  but we cannot leave it without a word more  about the instrumentality of mr  stoddard in connection with that work  of grace  he was abundant in preaching  he did not think that the most  ordinary sermons are good enough for the mission field  for he knew  that the nestorians could discriminate as well as others nearer home   and so wrote out his sermons carefully in english  but in the syriac  idiom  noting on a blank page the books consulted in their preparation   he also excelled in labors for individuals  the first inquirer became  such while mr  stoddard pressed home upon his conscience his guilt as a  sinner against god  and the same is true of many others  after  conversing with a person  he always led him to the throne of grace  and  then had him present his own offering there  and after such a one had  left  he seemed unable to turn his thoughts to any thing else  till  again in private he had commended him to god  indeed  he often began to  do this before they descended the stairs  he kept a little book  in  which he recorded every case  the state in which he found the person   and any subsequent change  and it was noticed that where he began  he  continued to labor  not only till there was hope  but even assurance of  hope  such labor is as exhausting as it is delightful  and no wonder  his strength proved less than his zeal and love     it was a great joy to him when his people could take part in prayer  meetings  he divided the thirty converts among them into three circles   and met each of them twice a week  this furnished him a season of  refreshment every day  and each of them took part at least once a week   they were thus early initiated into a course of christian activity  and  taught that they would lose much themselves  besides failing to do good  to others  if they held back  the converts were so rooted and grounded  in this truth  that once  when miss fiske was in geog tapa  a brother  said to her that she must not leave the village till she had induced a  woman to pray with her  whom they all regarded as a christian  but who  would not take part in their female prayer meetings  and when she  objected to urging her  deacon john replied   if she was an ordinary  christian  we might let her pass  but her position is one of such  prominence  that the other women will do just as she does  and so she  must do right   miss fiske talked long with the delinquent  but she  insisted that she could not do it  the missionary told of her own  trials in the matter   how she had staid away from meeting lest she  should be called on  and remained unblessed till she was willing to do  her duty  she prayed with her once and again  even a third time  before  she consented  saying   i will not displease god any more in this   so   drawing very close to her instructor  she offered two petitions for  herself  and one that her friend might be rewarded for showing her her  duty  hannah was soon active in the women s meetings  and is to this  day a most useful and consistent christian     another marked feature in mr  stoddard s labors was his tact in setting  others to work for christ  he taught his pupils that they must toil as  well as pray  and soon after the first converts were brought to christ   definite labor for others was assigned to them  not only among their  schoolmates and those who visited the premises  but also in gathering  in those not disposed to come to meeting  once  when three fourths of  the pupils were hopefully pious  mr  stoddard said   i must bring in  more  just to furnish work for these converts   he himself was happy in  his work  because he gave himself wholly to it  without the least  reservation  and amid the many trials that marked the years of his  residence in persia  he looked beyond them all  to him who not only can  give joy in suffering  but  by means of it  bring sinners to the  saviour     the hopeful converts in the seminary  after spending the summer of       at their own homes  in circumstances of great trial and temptation   returned  all save one  not only retaining their interest in spiritual  things  but established in christian character  their friends also  testified to their thoughtfulness  prayerfulness  and cheerful  obedience at home  and the influence of their piety was happy on others     for a while  in the autumn of       the school was disbanded on account  of the cholera  but  contrary to the fears of many  after a separation  of two months  all were spared to meet again  though hundreds had  fallen on all sides  three weeks afterwards  the christians among them  seemed more than usually earnest in prayer for the conversion of the  impenitent  and at once the answer came  the first one awakened was  moressa  now the wife of yakob  of supergan  and then about fourteen  years of age  she had been taken into the family of mrs  grant nine  years before  and that of mr  stocking afterwards  she had received  much religious instruction  with apparently little effect  but now her  convictions were deep  though she did not submit to christ for nearly a  week after she felt she was lost  her case deeply enlisted the  sympathies of her fellow pupils  and soon several others passed through  a season of deep distress  to rest in the grace of christ     one of these was eneya  sister of oshana  and now the wife of shlemon   in amadia  her widowed mother had fled with her children to oroomiah  before the koordish invasion of her native tehoma  few children have so  deep a sense of sin as she had  or exercise such implicit trust in the  saviour  at that time  her teacher wrote   may she become a messenger  of great good to her countrywomen   and now  that prayer is being  answered in her usefulness in that distant and lonely field of labor   altogether there were seven who seemed at this time to take the lord  jesus christ as their god and saviour           chapter xii       first fruits     sarah  daughter of priest eshoo   martha   hannah     let us now turn aside to take a nearer view of the first fruits of this  revival  the first to ask the way to heaven  to find it  and to enter  through the gate into the city  was sarah  or sarra  as the nestorians  pronounce it  she was born among the rude mountaineers of gawar  in        her father  eshoo  then a deacon  regarded her at first with the  aversion nestorian fathers usually felt towards their daughters  but  her strong attachment to him while yet a child  so won his heart  that  when the koords overran gawar  in       and the family fled from their  smouldering village  he was willing to be seen carrying her on his  back  in the same way that his wife bore her younger sister  the family  stopped for a time at degala  and subsisted by begging from door to  door  lodging at night in a stable  the fine intellect of the  self taught father soon brought him to the notice of the missionaries   and one day mrs  grant  then just about securing her long cherished  desire of a school for girls  asked him  in her winning way   have you  any daughters  and will you not send them to our little school   the  inquiry revived a wish that he had felt while yet in gawar  that his  daughter should learn to read  and in the spring of       when he moved  from degala to the city  he sent her to the mission school  she had  just entered her tenth year  a tall  slender  dark eyed girl  even then  giving indications of her early death  and though often a great  sufferer  she applied herself so diligently to study  that she soon  became  as she ever continued to be  the best scholar in the school     the ancient syriac bible was the principal text book  and she so far  mastered that language as to acquire a knowledge of scripture rarely  attained in any land by a child of her years  she was the walking  concordance of the school  and her knowledge of the doctrines of the  bible was even more remarkable  under the teaching of mrs  harriet  stoddard  she had also learned to sing sweetly our sacred music  still   with all her acquirements  she was destitute of grace  and her  declining health led her teacher to feel much anxiety for her salvation     on the first monday in       she said to sanum  one of her schoolmates   who  she knew  was thoughtful   sister  we ought to turn to god  shall  we ever find a better time than when so many are praying for us   they  together resolved to spend the day in seeking salvation  and the manner  in which they made known this purpose to their teacher  and carried it  out  has been already related   see p        from that day  she never  seemed to waver  as soon as she found peace for herself  she sought to  make others acquainted with her saviour  not forgetting  however  that  prayer of the psalmist   search me  o god  and know my heart  try me   and know my thoughts  see if there be any wicked way in me  and lead me  in the way everlasting   feeble as she was  she never shrank from  labor  hours every day were spent in her closet  and the rest of her  time was sacredly used for christ  she had much to do with the  conversion of the twenty schoolmates whom she was permitted to see in  christ before she went home  and she did much for the women who came to  the seminary  her teacher never knew a young person more anxious to  save souls  both pupils and visitors loved to have sarah tell them the  way  they said   we can see it when she tells us   no wonder they saw  it  for she seemed to look on it all the time  her teacher depended  much on her  and yet often remonstrated with her for such incessant  labors  still she felt that she must be about her father s business  while the day lasted  her desires for the salvation of her father  seemed to commence with her anxiety for herself  and his feelings were  soon so tender that he could not answer an inquiry about his own state  without tears  sarah was the first to know that he had found peace  his  first religious intercourse with her was to tell her that he had found  jesus  he had known that she was thoughtful  but was not prepared to  find her so full of humble hope and holy joy  next day  when urged by a  missionary to labor for the salvation of his family  he replied   sarah  knows the way to heaven better than i do  she can teach me far better  than i could her   their previous strong attachment now ripened into  christian love  he never felt that his daily bread had been given him   if he had not knelt with her in prayer  and his heart been lifted up by  her petitions as well as his own  her mother at first scoffed  but soon  she  too  sought the saviour  and her younger daughter  whose evil ways  for a time tried sarah sorely  was also afterwards brought into the  kingdom     mr  stocking used to call her  the best theologian among the  nestorians   and often said   if i want to write a good sermon  i like  to sit down first and talk with sarah  and then be sure that she is  praying for me      her attachment to the means of grace was strong  she went to every  meeting  even after she could not reach the chapel without help  her  emaciated form  her hollow cough  her eye bright with unnatural lustre   all told that she was passing away  but  combined with her sweet  singing and heavenly spirit  led her companions sometimes to whisper   as she took her seat in the chapel   have we not an elizabeth  wallbridge among us     the dairyman s daughter   in syriac  had just  then issued from the press  and was a great favorite with the  nestorians     as early as march  it was seen that she must die  still she clung to  the school  and not for nought  she had a mission to fulfil  and her  saviour strengthened her for the work to which he called her  as yet   none of the pious nestorians had finished their course  with the  converts  victory over death was something heard of  but never  witnessed  and sarah was chosen to show them  in what peace a christian  can die   perhaps the last days of no young disciple were ever watched  with more eager interest   will christ sustain us to the last  will he  be with us through the dark valley  will he come for us and receive us  to himself  as he promised   these were to them momentous questions   and they stood ready to answer them according as the lord supported  her  ever since her death they have looked upon the last change from a  new point of view  but we must not anticipate     the five months between her conversion and her decease were very  precious to all who knew her  she sometimes sat with her teacher and  talked an hour at a time on the home of the blessed  she seemed to look  in upon its glories  and share its gladness  and then her thoughts  turned to the perishing around her  saying   i would labor a little  longer for them  if it is my father s will   the young converts whom  she had taught could not bear the thought of her leaving them  but they  sought to stay an angel in his course  the dross had been consumed  and  the spirit was made meet for the inheritance of the saints in light      illustration  courtyard of the female seminary     about the middle of may  it was felt that she must go home to her  father  whose house was near the seminary  it was a beautiful day in a  persian summer  the morning exercises were closed  when her teacher  told her what they thought  she replied in a whisper   i think i had  better go  but i want to be alone a little before i leave not to  return   with weary step she sought the closet where first she found  her saviour  it was occupied  perhaps he saw she might think more of  the place than was meet  so she spent an hour in another room  and then  returned  saying   i am ready to go now   she went supported by a  schoolmate on either side  stopping in the court  she turned to take a  last look of the dear home where she had learned of jesus  and   plucking some of the roses that bloomed by her side  passed on  on the  preceding page that court is represented  as seen from the adjoining  one  she suffered intensely for a few days  her disease forbade her  lying down  even at night  but still not a day passed that she did not  gather some women about her  and point them to jesus  her teacher  visited her frequently  and often found her with her bible open  and  several women around her bed  to whom she was explaining it  the  praying pupils  too  often knelt with her at the accustomed throne of  grace     one saturday in june  her father was asked if he could go to  tergawer  twenty five miles distant  and preach  his reply was   i will  see what sarah says   she said   go  father  and i will pray for you    sabbath morning came  and her teacher saw that sarah was almost home   she told her so  and once more committed the dear pupil to the saviour  who stood by  she had to return to her duties in school  but first said  to her mother   send for me when the master calls for her  for  if i  cannot go over jordan with her  i would at least accompany her to the  swelling stream   in the afternoon her sufferings became intense  and  losing herself for a moment  she said   call my father   they told her  where he was   o  yes  i remember  don t call him  let him preach  i  can die alone   she then said   call miss fiske   and her sister  started to go  but the dying one remembered that it was the hour for  prayer meeting  and beckoned her to return  saying   she is in meeting  now  with my companions  don t call her  i can die alone   perhaps   with that teacher present  her eyes had not so clearly discerned the  lord jesus  her sufferings were now so great  she hardly spoke for an  hour  then she said  in a clear voice   mother  raise me  that i may  commit my spirit   for she would never approach her saviour but on her  knees  supported  as she had been hundreds of times before  by that  mother s strong arms  and in the attitude of prayer  she said   lord  jesus  receive    and there she stopped  prayer had ended  instead of  the closing words of the earthly petition was the opening of the new  song in heaven  the saviour did not wait for the close of her petition  before he answered it  the teacher had just sat down with her pupils  when the door opened  and a messenger said  sarah is asleep    yes    thought she  gratefully   till jesus shall say   awake    according to  eastern custom  sarah was buried that same evening  june   th   and the  whole school followed her to the grave  which was close to that of mrs   grant  the first fruit of the school appropriately lies by the side of  her who planted that tree in the garden of the lord  at the funeral her  teacher was just thinking that sarah could help her no more  that her  prayers and labors were forever ended  when she looked up  and her eye  rested on the evening star looking down upon the grave  it was a  pleasant thought that she  too  was a star in glory  she was glad that  the first to love christ was the first to go to be with him  and still  loves to think  of her as waiting for those who used to pray with her  on earth  the christian life of sarah was short  but she did much  for  she taught her people how       jesus can make a dying bed     feel soft as downy pillows are          footnote    for additional foots about sarah  see nestorian biography   pp             after sarah  like stephen among the early disciples  had led the way  into the presence of her saviour  blind martha was the next to follow     she was constrained by sickness to leave the school early in the spring  of       and go home to her parents in geog tapa  though six miles  distant  her schoolmates loved to walk out there to comfort her  they  prized no recreation so much as the privilege of going to see her  they  read and talked with her about her favorite portions of scripture   prayed with her  and were never allowed to leave without singing   jerusalem  my happy home   at such times  one of them said   her  countenance always showed that her spirit was walking the golden  streets   when asked about her health  she uniformly replied   the lord  helps me   and when urged to speak more particularly  would say   dear  sisters  the lord helps me  and that is enough   when  after five or  six of them had prayed in succession  she was asked if she was not  wearied  she would reply   i know that i am weak  but prayer never  tires me   so great a privilege was it deemed to be with her  that one  morning  when a pious member of the seminary at seir was called to  leave the village early  he said   i cannot go till i have prayed with  blind martha  and got from her manna for the road      her companions desired very much to be present when she went home  but  this was not permitted  one morning in june  she said  at early dawn    mother  the day breaks  i think jesus is coming for me now  let me  go   but seeing no change in her appearance  her mother lay down again   and  when next she woke  found that jesus had come  and taken her to be  with him in his home above  what was that vision of the glory of  immanuel that prompted the cry   mother  the day breaks   from one who  never remembered to have seen the light  she became blind in infancy  a  smile remained on her pale face  and well might the sight of him who  said   if i go to prepare a place for you  i will come again and  receive you unto myself   leave such a memento of the bliss     little hannah  the youngest member of the school  was suddenly called  home the following september  when only eleven years of age  when she  first came to christ  her teacher was awakened one morning by her  asking at the bedside   is it wrong to wish to die    but why do you  want to die    that i may go and stay with jesus  and never sin again    this desire never left her  once she said  with tears   it seems as if  i cannot wait so long to go to my saviour   and at another time   i  fear that i have sinned in not being willing to wait till jesus calls  me   before leaving for vacation  each pupil put up her own things in a  bundle  to be laid away till her return  as hannah was at work on hers   she said to a girl near her   perhaps you will open this  i do not  think that i ever shall  when you come together in the autumn  i trust  that i shall be in the saviour s school above   so strong was the  desire awakened in her by him who intended soon to gratify it     while the cholera raged around her in august  she frequently said    this may be my time to go to my dear saviour   and repeated it to her  mother on the last morning of her life  but went out as usual to her  work in the vineyard  about noon she became unwell  and said to a  companion   i am sick  perhaps i shall die soon    are you willing     o  yes  i am not afraid to go to jesus   the disease made rapid  progress  and again she said   i am very sick  i shall die soon  shall  we not pray together   her young friend led in prayer  and then called  on her to follow  but her time for prayer was almost finished  she  could just say   bless my dear sister  take me gently through the dark  river   when she sunk exhausted  and was carried to the house  a mother  bent over an only daughter  and three loving brothers over an only  sister  but they could not keep her back from jesus  she sent for her  companions  and they hastened to her bedside  she called for her  testament  but her eyesight was failing her  and she returned it   saying   i can never use it more  but read it more prayerfully  and  love the saviour more than i have done   she lingered through the  night  and rose with the dawn to her long desired rest in the presence  of her redeemer     it is remarkable that three timid girls should have been chosen to lead  the advance of a great multitude of nestorians through the dark valley  into the light beyond  no member of the boy s seminary died till three  years afterwards  and only two others of this before       a period of  eleven years  but infinite wisdom chose  through such weak and timorous  ones  to glorify the power of christ to bear his people through the  last conflict into everlasting rest           chapter xiii      subsequent revivals    deacon john studying backsliding in       work in village of  seir  wives of siyad and yonan  khanumjan  women at the seminary  geog  tapa  degala  a penitent  sin of anger  revival in       miss fiske  encouraged  stillness and deep feeling  unable to sing  conversion of  missionary children  visit of english ambassador  revival of        letter of sanum    the first indication of a work of grace in      was seen in the unusual  seriousness of deacon john  he had been reading pike s guide to young  disciples  and the chapter on backsliding moved him deeply  for a long  time  he went mourning his departure from god  one day he was reading  aloud in the seminary  when a missionary came in  and wondering to see  him there  asked what he was doing  he replied   i am studying  backsliding  and o  sir  i love it very much   meaning to say that he  loved to study the way back to the enjoyment of god  this state of mind  was followed by earnest effort for the salvation of others  and the  hopefully pious first passed through a season of deep heart searching  and renewed consecration to god  under an awful sense of the violation  of covenant vows  for many days some of them did nothing but weep and  pray   how unfaithful have i been to my saviour and to immortal souls    was the cry on all sides  one whose bible was found blotted with tears   had been converted in       and her grief was on account of her  unfaithfulness as a follower of christ  having thus wept bitterly  herself  she was well fitted to lead others to the god of all comfort   her labors were unwearied  both in and out of school  indeed  the  mission was now so reduced in numbers  that much of the work in this  revival was performed by the nestorians  and they proved themselves  very efficient  naturally ardent  they preached christ and him  crucified with a zeal and faithfulness rarely witnessed in our own  land  but their ardor needed careful guiding  for some were  at one  time  entirely prostrated by excessive labor     the pupils of the seminary  during a short vacation  seemed like angels  of mercy to their families and friends  in geog tapa  their meetings  for women every evening had an attendance varying from thirty to one  hundred  many of these were glad to learn the way of salvation  even  from children  besides this  the older pupils  under the guidance of an  experienced native helper  spent much time in personal conversation and  prayer with their own sex  as did the members of the other seminary  with the men     in the village of seir  the work was very general  in addition to the  labors of the pious students in the male seminary there  sanum and  moressa labored from house to house among the women  but hear their own  account of what they did  in a letter to miss lovell s school at  constantinople        what shall we tell you  beloved  of the great love god has shown to  our school and people  for two months we have had such delightful days  as we never saw in our lives before  the work of the lord has also  commenced in the villages  and in many there is great inquiry for the  way of life  the servants of god are so full of zealous love  that they  preach till their strength and voice give way  but again they go on to  preach  for the harvest is great  and the laborers few  how should we   with burning hearts  beg the lord of the harvest to send forth  laborers  can we bear  dear sisters  to see the deadly wings of satan s  kingdom spread out and destroy those bought by the precious blood of  christ  ought we not rather to wrestle like jacob till we see the  loving wings of the kingdom of the saviour spread out  and impart life  to wounded souls on every side  we hope that your waiting eyes may see  greater wonders among your own people than we do here      now we will tell you about the little village of seir  which contains  nineteen houses  god has visited every house  and because the women  were much awakened  and had no teacher  the missionaries sent two of us  there  not because we were fit for such a work   for we are deficient  in godly knowledge  and every qualification   but because god sometimes  chooses the ignorant and weak to do him service  and what shall we tell  you of the wonders god showed us among those poor women  there was no  time in which they did not cry  with tears   what shall we do    woe  unto us    we are lost   when we asked them to pray in meetings  they  prayed as if taught of god  we wondered at them very much  in one  house  we found a woman beating her head with both hands  crying   o my  sins  they are so great  there is no pardon   we tried to reason with  her  but if we took her hands from her head  she beat her breast  she  said   you told me  when you prayed with me the other day  to go to  christ  but he will not receive me  i am such a sinner   with  difficulty we quieted her  and told of the great mercy of the son of  david  we prayed with each woman of the village alone  and they with  us  fervently and in tears      in one instance  we heard an old man praying earnestly in the stable   and his wife in the house  we waited till they had finished  before we  went in  and there we found an old man  perhaps ninety years old  and  his wife  also very aged  we spoke with them of the lowly redeemer  and  how he was ready to dwell with them  poor as they were  the tears  rolled down their wrinkled faces  and made our own hearts burn within  us  the old man prayed with us as if christ stood right before him  and  we prayed with them both      there were meetings several times a day  and when they closed  the  voice of prayer might be heard on all sides  in the houses and stables   every family now has morning and evening worship      in this revival  the native helpers were very much interested for the  salvation of their unconverted wives  the families of siyad and yonan  live in geog tapa  and their first visits home were blessed to the  conviction of their companions  who soon came to the school  begging to  be allowed to stay and learn the way of life  of course  they were not  refused  the wife of siyad had been a frequent visitor there  but such  an opposer of religion  that her coming was always dreaded  but now how  changed  day by day her convictions deepened  till they were  overwhelming  tears were her meat  and prayer her employment  day and  night  till  as she said   the saviour found her   and she was at rest   three children and a daughter in law joined her in believing  and it  was delightful to see the family  not long after  each in his or her  turn  calling on the name of the lord in one of the rooms of the  seminary     yonan  the junior teacher of the school  had been married by force two  years before  by his wicked father  that  too  when his heart was fixed  on another  every way fitted to be his companion  it was a severe  trial  but grace triumphed  and his great desire  seemed to be the  conversion of the wife thus forced upon him  at midnight  he was often  heard interceding for her  and  in the early part of the revival  the  answer came  miss fiske will never forget the time when  in an  adjoining room  she heard her for the first time praying with her  husband  it gave her a new insight into the meaning of that scripture    they believed not for joy   the new convert was very active among the  women in her village  and when her father in law forbade social prayer  in his house  she took her little company at sunset behind the village  church  where even the bleak winds of february did not chill their  devotions     khanumjan  the aged mother of john  though past threescore and ten   entered into the work with a zeal that might put to shame many younger  women in our own land  she toiled to bring the more aged women right to  the cross  taking them one by one into her own closet  that then and  there they might accept the saviour  though herself unable to read  she  did much for the preachers who went out to the villages  providing food  for them on their return  and exhorting them to courage and  faithfulness  no wonder she said to a visitor   three years ago  i saw  christ in heaven  and i have seen him there ever since  but now he sits  by my side all day long   when she died  she said  over and over again    i am going after jesus      in this revival  the encouragement to labor for woman was greater than  ever before  after the middle of january  the seminary was almost  constantly thronged with inquirers  day and night  it was consecrated  by the prayers and tears of women seeking their saviour  on friday  and  on the sabbath  many from the neighboring villages spent the time there  between services  the room was filled with them  and even while they  ate  they must have some one speaking to them of jesus  those who did  so  often spoke with such tenderness as showed that christ himself was  very near  sometimes the women could not eat any thing but the bread of  life  at times  the anguish of some for sin was so overpowering  that  the question   can a woman forget her sucking child   might almost have  been answered in the affirmative  in some instances  the scenes that  took place were too much for frail nature to bear  and the laborers  were ready to ask to be clothed upon with immortality while the lord  passed by  those who spent the night in the seminary slept in the large  room on the lower floor  between the central door and that on the left   in the engraving  and occasionally the sound of their weeping and  praying banished sleep from the rooms above them  yet such hinderance  to rest brought a refreshment all its own     in geog tapa  the village ruler was found sitting at the feet of jesus   and going with the preachers from place to place  to give greater  weight to their words  and twenty five young men  though they could not  read  yet did what they could with untiring zeal     there was an interesting work in degala  so noted for vice that it was  called the sodom of the nestorians  the first converted there was a  young man employed in the seminary  he passed through a severe mental  conflict before his proud heart yielded  but when it did  he became a  living sacrifice to god  one day he came to the teachers  saying   i  have a petition to make  will you receive it   supposing it to be some  pecuniary matter  they replied   tell us what it is   he at once burst  into tears  and covering his face with his garment  said   my village  is lost  my family is perishing  and their blood is on my neck  let me  go to night and beg forgiveness for my wicked example  and urge them to  flee from the wrath to come   he obtained his request  and left   sobbing aloud  next morning  he brought his wife and two other women to  be instructed  about a week after  deacon tamo found in the village  several inquirers  and one woman in agony on account of her sins  she  had been notorious for wickedness  and so vile as hardly to find one  who would associate with her  though now one of the most lovely  christians in any land  the next day  she came to the seminary  and as  soon as miss fiske sat down beside her  she threw herself into her lap   crying   do tell me what to do  or where to go  to get rid of my sins    she was pointed to the lamb of god  and one moment her feet seemed to  rest on the rock of ages  and the next a fresh wave of conviction swept  her into the raging sea  so she vibrated between life and death  she  was asked to pray  in all her life she had not probably heard ten  prayers  but her strong crying and tears showed that the holy spirit  was her teacher  and the helper of her infirmities  she had learned to  pray where her saviour found a cradle  in the manger  cast out and  derided by her friends     she was first awakened in the seminary  for one day  as soon as she  entered the door  a pupil  then under deep conviction herself  and to  whom she was an entire stranger  seized her hand  saying   my sister   my sister  what are you doing  we are all lost  we must repent  or  perish   these words she could not forget  and from that hour sought  until she found her saviour  and then bore ill treatment with such  meekness as won others also to christ     the desire of the converts for instruction was most affecting  one of  them wept bitterly when asked if she was willing to forsake every sin   saying   what shall i do  i have one sin so strong that i fear i cannot  leave it off    what is it    i cannot live without these words of god   my husband will not let me go to hear them  and anger sometimes rises  in my heart at this  tell me what to do with this sin      an account of the revival in      will be given in the chapter on the  prayerfulness of the nestorians  after this were instances of  conversion each year  but not so marked  or so general  as in       so  we pass over the intervening time to dwell a moment on the revival of        that year  the pupils were very studious  and kind in their  feelings towards each other and their teachers  but the winter was  nearly over before any additions were made to the now diminished number  of believers  the teachers mourned  still the heavens were brass  and  the earth iron  christians were lukewarm  and none seemed to have power  with god     miss fiske returned from the english prayer meeting sabbath evening   february   th  in that desponding state that sometimes follows intense  and protracted desire  when its object is not attained  at such times   the sensibilities seem paralyzed  and emotion dies of sheer exhaustion   the pupils had retired  so also had miss rice  and she was left alone   her thoughts brooded over the state of her charge  but she had no  strength to rise and carry those precious souls to christ  she could  not sleep  and yet so shrunk from the duties of the morrow  that she  longed for a lengthening out of the night  rather than the approach of  dawn  eleven o clock struck  and there was a knock at the door  could  she open it  must she see another face that night  she did open it  and  there stood one of her pupils  not so without feeling as her fainting  heart had imagined  struck by the languor of her teacher s looks  she  inquired tenderly   are you very tired    no  not very  why do you  ask    i cannot sleep  our school has been resting on me all day  and i  thought perhaps you would help me to pray   the spell was broken  the  dry fountain of feeling gushed out afresh  and  with a full heart  she  said   come in  thou blessed of the lord   as an angel from heaven   that dear pupil strengthened her teacher that night  and together they  carried the whole household to jesus  when at length she retired  all  was sweetly left with christ  and he whispered peace  she could sleep  now  and when morning came there was still peace   could ye not watch  with me one hour   was the word spoken to her as she arose  and hardly  had she repeated it at morning prayers  before three  in different  parts of the room  were weeping  she said little  for she felt it safer  to go and tell jesus their wants and their unworthiness  all day  the  feeling in the school was subdued and tender  no one asked   what shall  i do to be saved   but there was quiet at the table  and quiet in the  rooms  the work was done willingly and well  but in silence  and the  voice of prayer in the closets was gentle  tuesday passed in almost  perfect stillness  no one said even   pray for me   towards evening   miss fiske said   if there is one who wants first of all to attend to  her eternal interests  i would like to see her at half past eight  o clock   at that hour  her door opened  and one entered alone  then  another and another  each alone  till the room was full  she closed the  door  but still they came  what were her feelings when she looked round  on twenty three  sitting with their heads bowed down in silence  she  said little  for she felt that they wanted to hear god  rather than  man  and the parable of the prodigal son that evening seemed to come  fresh from the lips of jesus     next day  each lesson was recited in its season  and recited well  but  tears blurred many a page  and at recess not a few went to be alone  with god  at eleven o clock  mr  perkins came in as usual to sing with  them   bartimeus  was the first hymn  all began it  but some voices  faltered on the first stanza  more on the second  and soon the leader s  voice was heard alone  he took up the bible lying on the desk  and  saying   perhaps some wanderer would like now to arise and go to her  heavenly father   he too read the portion of the night before  and led  in prayer  the teachers had to lengthen the intermission at noon   because they could not bear to summon the pupils so early from their  closets     the mission met that afternoon in the seminary  mr  stoddard came down  from seir covered with snow  saying  in his pleasant way  as he opened  the door   we have snowed down this time   but when he learned the  state of things  he said  very tenderly   you must have thought my  speech untimely  i did not know god was so near  but my heart is with  you  and i hope we both shall have a large blessing   that meeting was  almost all prayer  and the weeks that followed it witnessed a work  silent but deep  it was characterized by humble contrition  and much  simple dependence on christ  most of those twenty three  before the  close of the term  were hoping in his mercy     three missionary children were among the converts in this revival  and  their conversion did much good to the nestorians  for  though they had  felt their own need of regeneration  they were in doubt about the  children of pious parents  but when they saw the children of  missionaries weep over sin  and come as lost sinners to the saviour   they understood as never before that the entrance into the kingdom was  the same for all     at this time  the english ambassador passed through oroomiah  and  though  when he and his suite visited the seminary  there was some  apprehension felt as to the effect it might have on the religious  interests of the pupils  they not only did themselves credit  in the  examination he made of the school  but returned from the interview with  their relish for spiritual things undiminished  indeed  the event   which ordinarily would have been more than a nine days  wonder  caused  scarce a ripple on the deep current of spiritual emotion     the seminary was again blessed in       and the year following miss  fiske returned from seir after the funeral of harriet stoddard to  welcome several who had entered the fold of the good shepherd during  her absence     the labors of miss rice  who had charge of the school  while she was  away   have also been blessed in each of the four succeeding years   during that time  eighteen of the pupils have been received to the  communion  the revival in the winter of         was  however  more  interesting and extensive     at one meeting in the male seminary  the young men burst into tears  while singing the hymn   alas  and did my saviour bleed   and soon  after  in the saturday evening meeting  miss rice s whole school were  bowed in earnest prayer  and did not move for some time when requested  by her to retire for private devotion  on this occasion  mr  cobb  writes   it was my privilege to speak a word to them  and i can truly  say that i never saw such a scene before  as  with heads bowed down on  their desks  unable wholly to repress their sobs  they listened  and  again engaged in prayer   even then  it was only after repeated  requests that they went to their own rooms  where many continued their  supplications far into the night     the interesting scenes of these awakenings are thus gratefully recalled  by sanum  a convert of the first revival  in a letter dated salmas   june  th             beloved teacher  miss fiske  i received your priceless letter with many  tears of joy  and when i read your loving  motherly counsels  my heart  was full  it was drawn to you with inexpressible love  and when you  reminded me of those blessed revivals  my eyes were darkened with  floods of tears  so that  for a time  i could not read  how can i ever  forget the first night that you met me  after the lord had touched my  heart  in that blessed room  or how many times you took me by the hand   and led me to the throne of grace  often i was in the dark  and the  lord  through you  was pleased to give me rest  can i ever forget  when  the hand of the lord rested on me in the death of my dear children      how many times you came as an angel of peace to wipe away my tears   shall i ever forget the lord s coming among us by the still rain of the  holy spirit  or those meetings of the sisters for prayer  or those  tearful pleadings in the closets  can i ever forget the fervent  supplications and preaching of blessed mr  stocking  and how he begged  us to flee from the wrath to come  if i forget these  let my right hand  forget her cunning  and my tongue cleave to the roof of my mouth    footnote    page         it is a year  my beloved  since i have been able to go to oroomiah  i  have sorrowed greatly to be cut off so long from the supper of our  lord  and them that meet around his table  perhaps it is because i am  not worthy of the blessing  the lord mercifully grant that i be not cut  off from the heavenly supper of the lamb     our work here is much as before  i grieve to say that there are few  with whom i can pray  and in the few cases where i can do so  it must  be done as by stealth  but there are those with whom i can talk  hoimer  and i have a meeting for the women every sabbath  and on other days   every tuesday  hoimer  raheel  and i have a little meeting together   and it is very pleasant  but will be more so when the lord shall  increase our number  o that we longing ones might see that day  and our  troubled hearts rejoice     during the nineteen years since the seminary was established  it has  enjoyed  in all  twelve revivals  and though it is not desirable to  count up the results of human labors  it is due to the praise of divine  grace to record  that out of those who have been connected with it  as  many as two thirds have  in the judgment of charity  been created anew  in christ jesus           chapter xiv       dark days     seminary broken up in        deacon isaac   persecution by mar  shimon   funeral of daughter of priest eshco   deacon  guwergis

western asia  yet here  also  they who would live godly in  christ jesus have suffered persecution  on june   th        the  brothers of mar shimon issued this order   be it known to you all  ye  readers at seir  that if ye do not come to us tomorrow  we will  excommunicate you from our most holy church  your finger nails shall be  torn out  we will hunt you from village to village  and kill you if we  can   miss fiske was spending the summer there with her pupils  and it  was not deemed best to provoke further trouble by retaining them  when  told of this  they all wept aloud  nor did they weep alone  their  teacher  and the family of mr  stocking  in which they lived  could not  restrain their tears  it seemed as if the girls would never tear  themselves away from their teacher  and when at length they departed   again and again the lamentation arose   we shall never hear the word of  god again   miss fiske laid them at the feet of jesus  trusting that he  would bring them back to her  and others with them  a german jew  who  was present  said in his broken english   i have seen much bad to  missionaries in other countries  but nothing bad like this  to take  little children from words of jesus christ      even deacon isaac  a brother of mar shimon  who was prominent in the  act  was ashamed of it  on a visit to the school  eight years  afterwards  he asked leave to speak to the pupils  and said   my young  friends  i want you to do all you can to help your teachers  for i once  troubled miss fiske  and it has made my life bitter ever since   here  the good man broke down  and there was not a dry eye among his hearers   while he added   i have vowed before god that i will do all that i can  to help her as long as i live   and all who know him can testify that  he has kept his word  ever since his conversion in       when he first  began to be thoughtful  he heard that one of the pupils was in the  habit of praying for him  he sent for her  and insisted on her praying  with him  and though he was the most intelligent of the nestorians  and  possessed of rare force of character  and sarah was more noted for  devotion  than for her mental powers  yet he learned from her in a most  childlike spirit  and that scripture which says   a little child shall  lead them   found in this case a beautiful illustration     he has been occasionally employed in the school  and always proved a  very useful and acceptable teacher  when he bade miss fiske good bye   in       he said   you may rest assured that i will do all i can for  the women till you come back   and the next sabbath found him teaching  a class of adult females  in our favored land  the grace of god has  made it nothing strange for the governor of a state to be a teacher in  the sabbath school  but one who has not lived in persia can form no  idea of what it is for a brother of mar shimon to teach a class of  women  he has great skill in bringing out the meaning of scripture  and  is every where exceedingly acceptable as a bible teacher  along with  unfeigned piety  he has more real refinement than any of his  countrymen  and few nestorians can show kindness with such true  delicacy of feeling     the health of miss fiske was so impaired in the spring of       that  she reluctantly yielded to the advice of the mission  and went with mr   stocking to erzroom  to meet mr  cochran and family  then on their way  to persia  when they returned  they found mr  stoddard s health so  seriously affected by long continued over exertion  that he only  awaited their arrival to leave for trebizond  little did they dream  that it was mrs  stoddard s last farewell to the scene of her labors     nor was this all  the patriarch mar shimon  who had long worn the guise  of friendship  now threw off the mask  he broke up schools in small and  distant villages  and secured the beating of a man by the governor on  the charge of apostasy  the female seminary was honored with his  special anathema   has miss fiske taught you this   was his frequent  demand of those who fell into his hands  followed by such reviling as  only an oriental could pour forth     on the morning of july   th  the infant daughter of priest eshoo  named  sarah  after her sainted sister  lay on her death bed  and to punish  her father for his preaching  mar shimon forbade her burial in the  nestorian graveyard  he collected a mob ready to do his bidding as soon  as she should die  but she lingered on  and so disappointed him for  that day  next day she died  and at once he anathematized all who  should assist in her burial  a pious carpenter  however  forced his way  through the mob  and made her coffin  he remained steadfast throughout  the storm  replying to every dissuasion of his friends   i must go  forward  even to the shedding of my blood      the missionaries appealed to a former governor  who owned that part of  the city  for leave to bury in the cemetery used by the nestorians from  time immemorial  but the patriarch paid no attention to his messages   and the child remained unburied  miss fiske wrote   as we look out on  this troubled sea  and sympathize with these afflicted parents  we love  to look up and think of the dear child as sweetly resting on the bosom  of the saviour  may the sabbath bring us a foretaste of heavenly rest    but it found them still  where storms arise and ocean rolls   the  governor sent men to demand the digging of a grave  which the mob would  not allow  meanwhile  the profligate mar gabriel craftily suggested  that a promise from the priest not to preach any more  might end the  trouble   never   was the prompt reply   let my dead remain unburied   but i will not go back from the service of the lord   this so enraged  the patriarch  that  for the sake of peace  the governor advised to  bury the body in one of the villages  the sorrowing parents then locked  their house  and leaving their babe alone in its slumbers  went to the  chapel  there they found comfort from a sermon on the text   through  much tribulation we must enter into the kingdom of god   about twenty  men returned with them to the house  then one bearing the little coffin  went before  the rest followed  singing the forty sixth psalm  even  moslems gazed with wonder  as they passed close by the door of the  patriarch  and went out of the city gate  the engraving  page       gives a very good representation of this gate  on the green hill side  at seir the little one was laid to rest  and the father  thanking the  company for their kindness  hastened them back  to be in time for the  afternoon service     in the mean time  mar shimon sent far and near  forbidding all  intercourse with the missionaries  at geog tapa  in the absence of the  malis  he ordered an old man  who formerly held that office  to summon  the people before him  only a few vagrants obeyed  and these he  commanded to break up the schools  and prevent preaching in the church   so  that evening  when john commenced preaching  they proceeded to  execute their orders  but  afraid to face the determined people  they  deferred the attack till the hearers passed out  and then  like stanch  old puritans  hardly noticing them  the congregation wended their way  homewards  singing psalms as they went      illustration  seir gate  oroomiah     the patriarch now excommunicated mar yohanan  and made common cause  with the french lazarists  he even wrote a fraternal epistle to the  pope  ready for any thing  if he could only crush the mission  his  attendants marched about the mission premises with loud threats  pious  nestorians were knocked down in the streets  while his brother isaac  went to a distant village  to show that he had no sympathy with such  iniquity     soon after  the carpenter who made the coffin was severely beaten by  his own father for attending a prayer meeting  as the blows fell thick  and fast  he cried   must this come from my own father   but he  remained firm  and next day went to the chapel pale and weak  but  filled with holy joy     deacon guwergis  prevented from going to the mountains   for the koords  sided with mar shimon   fearlessly encountered the revilings of the  patriarch in his own house  and told him that he hoped to continue  preaching till he died  his countenance must have shone like stephen s   for his persecutor said to one of the attendants   see how his face  glistens  if he is so bold here  what will he be in the mountains    well might a missionary write   what a blessing are such men  the sight  of them is worth ten thousand times the sacrifices made by us all      though this was vacation  fifteen of the pupils remained in the  seminary for protection during the storm  yet even there they were not  wholly safe  on the   th of august  a messenger came in haste for one  of them  saying that her dying brother wished to see her immediately   as the man was her relative  the girl was ready to go at once  but  providentially miss fiske learned that the brother was well  and the  messenger had been seen last with mar shimon  so he left  chagrined and  enraged at his failure  the patriarch had told him to be sure and hide  his purpose from that satan  miss fiske  and in case of failure  to  take the girl by force  but the teacher had had some experience in  guarding her fold  and both she and her pupil were thankful for the  deliverance  next day  mar shimon forbade preaching in geog tapa  but  if the church was closed  the house tops remained open  the same day   the school in vizierawa was repeatedly dispersed  but each time  reassembled by the teacher     the   th of this month was such a day as the mission had never seen  before  in the forenoon  the teacher from charbash fled wounded from  the servants of mar shimon to the mission premises  scarcely had he  entered  when his brother came in  having escaped from similar  violence  the moslem owner of the village had to put a stop to the  tearing down of their house     miss fiske and miss rice had just sat down to dinner with the school   when the cry   a man is killed   was followed by a rush from all parts  of the yard  a mob at the gate was trying to break in and seize the  native helpers  mar yohanan was wounded  and all was confusion  the  teachers exhorted their little flock not to count their lives dear to  them  for jesus  sake  happily  they were not called to such a test of  discipleship  but the sympathies of the moslems were plainly with mar  shimon  and no one knew what a day might bring forth  that tried friend  of the mission  e w  stevens  esq   english consul at tabreez  feared  lest the missionaries should fall by the hand of violence  miss fiske  writes   our native friends will doubtless suffer much  and we rejoice  to share with them  we hope that fears on our account will not be  realized  still there is danger  and we try to be ready for life or  death  as our father sees best  though in a land of violence  we are  not unhappy  we trust in god  and hope this vine is being pruned that  it may bring forth more fruit  we would have all the gracious designs  of god fulfilled  even though we should be cast down      the same day came tidings of the death of mrs  stoddard  at trebizond   and miss fiske wrote that night an account of it to her former teacher   at south hadley  adding   precious sister  she died far away  but my  father knows why i might not stand by that dying bed  and i would  submit  though my heart bleeds   our  homes are sad to night  and there  is many a weeping eye among those for whom she toiled so faithfully   from my first acquaintance with her  she has been to me all that mortal  could be  her heart was tenderly alive to the spiritual interests of  the dear nestorians  and to them she devoted all her powers  it was she  who first taught their daughters to sing the songs of zion  few   probably  have accomplished so much in so short a life  her family  the  mission  the seminary  and all about us  shared in her untiring labors   as truly as of dear mrs  grant may it be said of her   she hath done  what she could       like mrs  grant  she was the youngest member of the mission at the  time of her death  when she left her native land  some almost regretted  that so frail a flower should go forth to encounter the hardships of  missionary life  but she did much  and did it well  the seminary in  seir still bears the impress she stamped upon it  her memory is not  only fragrant today among the nestorians  but it draws them nearer to  christ  and renders them more efficient in his service      mar shimon now made common cause with the persian nobility  the english  and russian ambassadors had procured the appointment of dawood khan as  governor of the christians in oroomiah  in order to protect them from  illegal oppression  the nobility of course opposed this  and mar  shimon  by promising his aid in the removal of the protector of his own  people  secured their cooperation in his wickedness  the converts were  now insulted at every turn  they could hardly appear in the street  and  the authorities afforded no redress  the missionaries had no earthly  friend nearer than mr  stevens at tabreez  who did all he could for  them  and the pious natives felt shut up to god as their only refuge     yahya khan  the governor of the province  now wrote urging on mar  shimon  and ordered his agent in oroomiah to aid him to the utmost of  his power  as yahya khan was brother in law to the king  he was able to  do the mission much harm at the court  and the patriarch  encouraged by  such a coadjutor  set himself with renewed zeal to destroy it  but in  september  the prince royal summoned him to tabreez  and the nobility  hardly daring to resist the order  he was reluctantly preparing to  comply  when news came of the death of the shah  and all was confusion   the missionaries had been praying for help against their dreaded enemy   yahya khan  and lo  his power to harm them perished with his master     the night after the news reached oroomiah  anarchy reigned  and all  kinds of crime abounded  five men were killed near the mission  premises  and the firing of guns was heard all night long  but though  outside were robberies and murders  within that enclosure all was  peace  though its inmates knew that the fanatical population would  gladly stone them  yet they felt it a privilege to labor on under the  care of the keeper of israel     in persia  no king  no government  so besides this anarchy in the city   the koords came down and plundered many villages  burning the houses  and driving the people for shelter to oroomiah  these strokes fell most  heavily on the moslems  many of whom were robbers themselves  the fear  of an attack on seir was at one time so great  that the ladies were  sent off  and the gentlemen remained alone to guard the mission  premises  but both in seir and the city the houses of the missionaries  were thronged by multitudes seeking relief  and each approaching  footstep announced some new tale of woe     mar shimon  after the death of the king  prudently retired into turkey   and his servants were put under bonds to keep the peace  the koords   however  drove him back  later in the season  but stripped of his power  to persecute  it may sound like the close of a tale of fiction to add   that the next time miss fiske met the patriarch was in gawar  august         when he rode up to the tents of the missionaries to inquire after  their health  before he went to his own  he staid an hour and a half   appearing more free and social than ever before  and when they returned  his visit  he came out of his tent to meet them  and treated them with  unusual respect  saying  in the course of the interview   i fear that  miss fiske is not happy here  she does not look well   on being assured  that she was both well and happy  he said to his attendants   this lady  is happy only as she has a number of nestorian girls around her  eating  care    for them  teaching and doing them good   so  when our ways  please the lord  he maketh even our enemies to be at peace with us    footnote  this is the nestorian idiom  we say   taking care of them       babilo  the carpenter  who made the coffin for the child of priest  eshoo  was taught to read by the younger girls in the seminary after  school hours  and thus writes to miss fiske  november   th              i remember how  thirteen years ago  in that trouble with mar shimon   when my father beat me for attending meeting  and men despitefully used  me  dear mr  stocking and you comforted me in the great room  i shall  never forget your love  give my love to your dear mother  who so loved  us that she willingly gave you to the lord  as hannah did samuel      if you inquire about my work in the city sabbath school   i teach a  class of ten women  three of them  i trust  are christians  when i read  your letter to them they greatly rejoiced  i reminded them of the  meetings you used to have for them in your room  and their eyes filled  with tears  in the afternoon i went to charbash  and read your letter  to the eighteen women in my class there  they  too  were very glad   five of them  i trust  are christians  we are now studying second  timothy  after the lesson  i question them on old testament history   and then i teach the women and their children to sing            chapter xv       trials     evil influence of homes   opposition in degala   asker khan   poisoning  of sanum s children   redress refused   inquisitor in school   troubles  at khosrawa   letters from hoimar     but  aside from open persecution  there is a constant danger arising  from the people themselves  the teacher in a christian land can never  fully understand the feelings of the missionary teacher  the one sends  forth his pupils to meet christian parents  brothers and sisters  who   with more than a teacher s love  lead the young convert by still  waters  and establish him in holy feeling  but the flock of the other  goes out often into families where every soul would gladly break the  bruised reed and quench the smoking flax  he can sympathize with paul  in his anxiety in behalf of those for whom he had labored in the gospel     sometimes the pupils of the seminary so dreaded the scenes of home  in  vacation  that they preferred to remain in the school     in april        miss fiske visited the village of degala  as it was a  holiday  most of the women had gone out for amusement  but a little  company of twelve praying ones gathered around her  and listened in  tears while she spoke of jesus and his love  their fervent prayers for  neighbors and friends made her feel that a blessing was yet in store  for degala  these women suffered all sorts of insult for their  attachment to the truth  they were often beaten and driven from their  homes by their husbands  while the pupils of the seminary were here   some of their own sex did all they could to annoy them  but read an  account of their trials from the pen of sanum  of gawar  she writes to  a friend in this country        i had bitter times this vacation  for our neighbors are all very  hard hearted  not listening at all to the words of god  when i opened  my testament to read to them  they would shut it  and begin to quarrel  about the forms of religion  i entreat you to pray for my village  that  i  so unworthy  may see its salvation      one day  miss fiske went to the village of degala  where is a band of  women who greatly love the lord  they gathered about her  and she had a  very pleasant time  all these were inquiring what they should do to be  saved  she could not stay long with them  but they were so humble that  they asked to have some of the girls sent to them  so four of us   though so weak  ventured to go in the name of christ  we found these  sisters in great distress  being reviled and beaten by wicked men  for  jesus  sake      we were speaking in an upper room there on a feast day  and the women  with us were weeping very much  while others  afraid to come in  seated  themselves on the terrace by the window  suddenly a wicked man came  with a rod  and drove all those away who were without  poor souls  how  my heart burned for them  one  who had not been used to come to  meeting  came that day for sport  she wore many ornaments  but as soon  as she heard the words of god  her tears began to flow  after meeting   she arose up quickly  and threw aside her ornaments  and followed us  wherever we went  we were having a meeting in another house  when a  quarrelsome woman entered  having a large stick in her hand  and began  to beat her daughter and daughter in law  and she carried off her  daughter  but the other remained  though sorely bruised  saying   i  will spill my blood  but will not leave the place of prayer   the women  who fear god wept much because this woman did so      we went to the sacrament  and there was a company of women who  separated themselves from the others  and were weeping in one corner of  the church  some very bad women came to them  and said   let us rise up  and dance  because they are weeping   another  in anger  took the  sacrament from the mouth of one of them  and gave it to her little  granddaughter  there was much confusion in the village  and they seemed  like those who cried   great is diana of the ephesians   one said   i  wish neither satan nor god  but only mar shimon   once  when we were  assembled with the women  and moressa was speaking  a wicked man fired  a pistol to frighten us  but the women encouraged us  saying   go on   and speak louder  that he may hear   and when he heard my sister speak  of the wickedness of man s heart  he cried out   those words must have  been for me  she must have known that i was there       it does not fall within the object of this volume to give any detailed  account of the proceedings of asker khan  who for several years sought  to wear out the saints of the most high  causing the native helpers to  be beaten  fined  and annoyed in many ways  and then arrogantly denying  all redress  encouraged in his persecutions by the prime minister  he  was able to defy all interference  indeed  during part of the time  the  english ambassador was constrained to leave the kingdom  and the  russian ambassador  though personally disposed to do all in his power  for the mission  was yet officially unable to help     at one time  he gave orders that no school should be opened without his  sanction  and that all the teachers must report to him  and in case of  disobedience  he threatened them with fines and imprisonment     it may show in what estimation the influence of the female seminary was  held by enemies  when we find him issuing his command   allow no girls  to attend your school  schools are for boys alone   and claiming credit  for great forbearance because he did not at once break up the seminary   that which called forth such opposition from enemies was surely not  inefficient  there must have been a power for good manifest even to  moslem opposers  that taught them where to strike so as most  effectually to destroy   but there was a power above them that said    thus far  and no farther    the bush burned with fire  yet it was not  consumed      the evil wrought by asker khan was not confined to his own doings  his  hostility  in a position so commanding  emboldened every shimei to  curse  in ardishai  two or three unprincipled drunkards  with their  dissolute bishop  mar gabriel   saved themselves from mohammedan  rapacity by taking part against the converts  these last were made  examples of  to deter others from attending preaching or sending their  children to the schools   one poor widow  with four children   a most  consistent christian   was driven from her house by her father in law   because she allowed her oldest daughter to attend the village school   as many as thirty families  unable to endure persecution any longer   fled from the village  and priest abraham himself  after suffering  much  was compelled to leave  though his congregation was from one  hundred and fifty to two hundred every sabbath     in dizza takka  on the evening of april   th        sanum  who  graduated in       had arsenic put into the supper which she carried to  a neighbor s tandoor  native oven  to be warmed  happily  joseph  her  husband  was delayed beyond his usual hour  so that he was uninjured   and the quantity of arsenic was so large  that  by the prompt use of  remedies  the mother s life was saved  though her innocent children  suffered severely  and  after lingering a few months  both of them  died  she rose from weeping over their graves to serve her master more  faithfully than ever  but asker khan   though the arsenic was found at  the bottom of the pot  though a portion of the contents  given to a  cat  speedily produced convulsions and death  and though a jewess  testified that  the neighbor  had recently applied to her husband for  arsenic  and no one else had access to the vessel where it was  found   instead of investigating the case  insulted joseph and his  friends  and caused his aged father to be beaten  at the same time  telling the people of dizza takka to shoot joseph if he went to their  village again  such conduct emboldened the enemies of the truth to  complain against the more enlightened of their clergy who had renounced  many sinful customs  as forsaking the religion of their fathers  and   with blasphemous threats  they were ordered to do the bidding of their  accusers     on the  st of june  an order from the authorities at tabreez to asker  khan was presented to him by the missionaries  which  after a calm  recital of the facts in the case of poisoning  proceeded thus   as the  person who did this act is a criminal  and  if unpunished  the affair  may lead to the destruction of life  it is necessary that you  high in  rank  take the attitude of investigation  and having discovered the  criminal  that you punish him  with the knowledge of the americans  and  so act that no one  christian or moslem  shall dare to repeat such a  crime   this order was obtained through the kind offices of the russian  ambassador  but the criminals were only detained a few days  and not  pressed at all to a confession  asker khan then proposed  as they had  not confessed  that the missionaries should intercede for their  release  of course  they refused  then  saying  that if he had known  that  beforehand  he would not have touched the matter  and that he  could defend himself at tabreez   he dismissed the accused  and it was  in vain for the missionaries to prosecute the matter further     indeed  the opposition at this time was more serious than at any  previous period  and for a time it seemed as though the seminaries  and  especially the female seminary  would be destroyed     in the autumn  a commissioner  sent from teheran to examine into the  proceedings of the mission  made an inquisitorial visit  and went all  through the building  peeping into the chambers  and making himself and  suite every where at home  coming into the recitation room  where most  of the girls were engaged in study  he selected  a large  robust pupil   who could speak turkish  and questioned her as follows        are you allowed to follow your own customs       we follow all that are good  but not such foolish ones as you would  not wish us to follow       do these ladies let you see your friends       certainly  we always see them when they come here  and we go home  three times a year  staying  at one time  three months       what do you do when at home       we work in the fields  and do any thing that our friends do  our  teachers tell us to help our friends all we can  and are displeased if  we do not       can you work  or have you become ingleez    english       look at me  i am strong  i can carry very large loads       what do you do here       we study  and learn all wisdom       are you allowed to use your own books       certainly  the principal book of our religion they have printed for  us  and we use it more than any other       but have you not left the books of your fathers       the book i spoke of is our sacred book  like your koran  and we use  all others that agree with that       do you fast       one day at the beginning of the year  and other days afterwards       but have you not forsaken some of your church fasts       none that are written in that book  i keep all those very carefully       what  twice in the week       no  for that is not required in the book       but your people do       yes  not being readers  they do many things that are not written in  the book       would your teachers allow you to fast       o  yes  but we don t want to fast more than our book requires       what are your prayers       those taught in the book      then followed questions about dress  employment  and such things  all  of which she answered in the same manner  the teacher was very thankful  that the master had neither left to her the selection of the witness   nor her preparation for the examination  but the examiner expressed  very decided disapproval of female education  and held up their  previous condition as their only proper one  the truth was  the moslems  were angry that their rayahs were being elevated  and they were  specially indignant at the education of women     so the opposition went on  messrs stoddard and wright proceeded to  tabreez  and secured orders for redress which  as usual  were  counteracted by secret orders to the contrary  the native helpers were  now beaten because they were in the employ of the mission  some were  thrown into prison  and threatened with being sent to teheran in irons   but when the lord saw that the wrath of man had proceeded far enough   he restrained the remainder thereof  for one of the leading spirits in  this onset on the mission fell under the daggers of the koords  and his  death at once called off attention from missionary operations to other  things     again  in january        two pious residents at khosrowa  in the  province of salmas  were shamefully oppressed  and when application was  made for redress  asker khan not only refused to adjudicate the matter   but beat one of the complainants so severely that he was confined to  his bed for weeks  still later  after urgent importunity from  nestorians and nominal papists  two very able and excellent men   deacons joseph and siyad  were sent to labor in that distant province   on one occasion they entered the village of khosrowa to purchase fuel   and were quietly passing along the street  when a mob stoned them out  of the village  shortly after  deacon siyad was expelled from the  district so suddenly that he had to leave his wife  merganeeta  she   too  was driven away alone  but holmar  a pious woman residing there   went with her  the first night they spent in a field  and the next day  they sought refuge in an armenian village  but  driven from thence  the  persecuted wife fled to oroomiah  after long effort  an officer was  sent from tabreez to salmas  and ample promises of full redress were  given  ending  as usual  in nothing  a mob  headed by a french lazarist  and native bishop  rescued the offender  and the officer desisted from  further procedure     the reader will be interested in the following extract  from a letter  of hoimar to miss fiske  in             i cannot tell you how glad i am to hear that your health is better  o  that quickly you might meet us  if the lord will  till death i can  never forget your love  nor your reminding your pupils to ask the lord  to support a poor  ignorant one like me  i do not believe your thoughts  can ever rest about your little company of nestorians  if a mother  leaves a nursing child  she cannot rest till she returns to it  if you  are far from us in body  i know your spirit is with us  if jonah  mourned over the gourd for which he had not labored  how shall not you  mourn after those for whom you have labored      if the breezes did not bring the cry of  salvation  over the ocean   our desolations would cry out  but thanks to him who favors those that  leave their native land to labor among the ignorant  yet what shall  this people do  the beast having great iron teeth still reigns here   but it may be the lord will speedily destroy him with the breath of his  mouth  i trust that you will ever remember in your prayers one who will  remember you in her weakness till death      two years later brought the following  with its graphic delineation of  the trials that such as choose the better part may meet with yet for  years to come       beloved miss fiske  almost every day of this summer has been a bitter  day  for my mother had become willing to give raheel  rachel  sister of  hoimar  to the papists  and she had prevailed over my father to do the  same  and now i will tell you how goliah fell upon the earth  and he  that had no weapons overcame  but it was from the power of god  the  arrangement had all been made by my parents  and the betrothal feast  made ready  sanum and i were in oroomiah  but deacon joseph was in  salmas  and we had also this comfort  my oldest brother stood firm   saying   fear not  till death  i  stand   raheel also was firm  hoping  for help  with entreaties and tears  i asked deacon isaac to go to  salmas  he went  but raheel knew it not  she was very sorrowful for  only an hour remained to the time fixed for putting the betrothal ring  on her finger  the hope of her life seemed to hang on a hair  she went  to the vineyard  and prayed god to deliver her  then returned sorrowful  to her room  she hears them say   they have come   and locks her door   they ask her to open it  bat she opens it not  just then  deacon joseph  goes to the window  and  seeing that doacon isaac has come  says    open  be not afraid   deacon isaac sits down with the papists who have  come to the betrothal  my father leaves it with him  and he says   very  well  i have only now come  i must have time to examine into this  business  to morrow i will give you an answer   he talks with my  father  saying   how can you give your daughter to the papists  the  missionaries are not willing  our people are not willing  i am not  willing  and more than all  the girl is not willing   my father at  length said   she is your daughter  not mine  do as you please   then  deacon isaac sent word to the papists   there is no possibility of your  carrying this forward  i have questioned the girl  she is not willing   speak no more about it   the deacon then asked my father to let her go  to the city to school again  at first he consented  but finally left it  with her mother  who did not let her go  the deacon left displeased   when i heard this  i arose and took mar yohanan s brother  and went to  salmas  thinking i might possibly bring raheel  while yet a good way  from the village  like canaan s spies  we sent for my oldest brother   who is  as we trust  a christian   he  gave us good news  and said    raheel is all ready to go to school   as the lord favored eleazar  about rebecca  so he favored us  and the next morning my sister and  deacon joseph returned to oroomiah  while i remained to meet the wrath  of my mother  as soon as raheel was gone  she left  and as yet we know  not where she is  truly  great is the power of prayer  so god brought  to nought evil counsels  scattered fearful  dark clouds  and caused the  light of joy to rise upon us  but i am very sad about my mother   because she has turned away from the fear of god  and is fleeing from  life  my father and husband still get intoxicated  i trust that you  will multiply your prayers for them  and ask your friends to do the  same  and to pray for me  and our village and country  give my love to  all your friends     from your lover  hoimar     we shall hear from hoimar again  in connection with the communion           chapter xvi       prayerfulness     language of

answer to mothers  prayers   connection of  revivals with prayer at home     the nestorian converts have been noted for their spirit of prayer     in       the prayers of the hopefully pious in the male seminary were  very remarkable  several rooms were appropriated to devotion  and there  one might hear the voice of supplication from morning till night  many  spent several hours a day in this holy employment  and one needed only  to listen to know that their prayers came from the depths of the soul   at one time  they beg that the dog may have a single crumb from the  table of his master  again  they are smiting on their breasts by the  side of the publican  now they are prodigals  hungry  naked  and far  from their father s house  and now they sink in the sea  crying   lord   save me  i perish   or  as poor outcast lepers  they come to the great  physician for a cure  this one builds on the rock of ages  while the  torrents roar around  that one washes the feet of jesus with his tears   and wipes them with the hair of his head  another  as a soldier of the  cross  plants its blood stained banner in the inner citadel of his  heart  their ardent feelings found such appropriate expression in their  oriental metaphors  that one might learn from children to pray as he  never prayed before     on the reopening of the seminary that spring  the first desire of the  pupils was to enter their closets and commune with god     riding out one evening  mr  stoddard saw three persons before him on  the way to seir  their horses went from one side of the road to the  other  at random  and their own heads were uncovered to the cold march  wind  at first he took them for dervishes  but on coming nearer he  heard the voice of prayer  and found they were nestorians  the eyes of  all were reverently closed  and when one finished the other continued  their supplications  he turned aside  and left them undisturbed  on  another occasion  when john and moses were riding to geog tapa on the  same horse  they again engaged in devotion  but as the horse was  unruly  they each prayed in turn  while the other held the reins     sometimes the language of their prayers is very broken  mr  stoddard  once stood in the church in supergan  twenty miles from oroomiah  while  prayers were read in the ancient syriac  and overheard an old man  very  ignorant  praying back in the congregation by himself  he had  perhaps   never heard five prayers  in his whole life  in a language he could  understand  but reverently  and in a low tone  commingling the memories  of old forms with the utterance of new desires  he was saying   our  father in heaven  always going  after satan  o lord jesus  christ  hallelujah  forever and ever  amen   it was incoherent  but  comprehensive  he addresses god as his heavenly father  he confesses  his sins  he appeals to christ as his only helper  he praises god for  his unspeakable gift  and then closes in the usual form     the pious mar ogen  of ishtazin  when in great pain  and hardly able to  move  often broke out in words like these   o lord jesus  thou art the  king of glory  the king of kings and lord of lords  thou art great and  holy  and merciful  i am a sinner  condemned  my face is black  my  bones are rotten  o lord jesus  have mercy upon me  poor  and blind   and naked  and miserable  o lord jesus christ  i am vile  i am lost   but do thou remember me      no language expressed their sense of guilt better than the words   all  our righteousnesses are as filthy rags   in the fervor of their desire  for christ  and grace through him  they would say   blessed saviour  we  will cling to the skirts of thy garment  and hope for mercy till our  hands are cut off   a common petition was   o lord  we pray that we may  never deny thee  even to the blood of our necks   most expressive  words  in a land where so many criminals are beheaded     one prayed for our country  when he heard of the southern rebellion   thus   o god  pour peace into that land  permit them not to fight with  each other  but with satan and their wicked hearts  and may they fight  spiritually to subdue the whole world to christ      during one of the revivals in the female seminary  the prayers of the  pupils were exceedingly earnest  a member of the mission  having  occasion to open the door of a room where a few of them were together   heard as follows      we are hanging over a lake of fire  with a heavy load upon our backs   by a single hair  and that is almost broken  we are in a ship burned  almost down to the water  the flames are just seizing upon us  o god   have mercy  jesus  son of david  have mercy  o lamb of god  have mercy  on us    no wonder   a missionary wrote   i sometimes think that it is  pleasanter to pray in syriac than in our own language  because i have  such fervent minded ones with whom to pray      the day miss fiske left oroomiah  a large number of women and girls  gathered around to bid her farewell  they said   can we not have one  more prayer meeting before you leave   they were told that they might  meet in the school room   but may it not be in that bethel   they  asked  referring to the teacher s own room  she told them she could not  lead their devotions then  their reply was   you need not do it  we  will  carry you  to day   seventy were soon assembled in her room  they  sung   blest be the tie that binds   and offered six prayers  one asked  that when elijah should go up  they might all see the horsemen and  chariot  and all catch the falling mantle  not sit down to weep  or  send into the mountains to search for their master  but take up the  mantle  go  smite jordan  and  passing over  go to work  she then  reminded the saviour that he had promised not to leave them orphans   john xiv      greek and syriac   and begged him not only to come to  them  but to abide with them when their teacher was gone  her thoughts  then turned to the departing company  who were to take their long land  journey of six hundred miles on horseback  she asked that the sun might  not smite them by day  nor the moon by night  theirs was a desert way   and the lord was entreated to spread a table for them through all the  wilderness  and  when they should pass over the narrow  precipitous  roads  to give his angels charge to keep them in all their ways  and  bear them up in their hands  lest they dash a foot against a stone  and  when they should go through the rivers  not to let the waters overflow  them  the company would lodge by night in tents  and it was asked that  the angel of the lord might ever encamp round about the moving  tabernacle  borne in mind as they should pass on  first to the steamer   and then to the sailing vessel  she asked that when they should be on  the  fire ship   the flame might not kindle upon them  and when on the   winged ship   where the waves would go up to heaven  and down to hell   that he would keep them in the hollow of his hand  and bring them to  the desired haven  she then asked that all her teacher s friends might  be spared till she should reach them  especially the aged mother  and  that when she should fold her daughter in her arms  she might say  like  simeon of old   now lettest thou thy servant depart in peace   here she  paused  and miss fiske thought she had finished  but soon she added    may our teacher s dust never mingle with a father s dust  or with a  mother s dust  but may she come back to us to mingle her dust with her  children s dust  hear the trumpet with them  and with them go up to  meet the lord  and be forever with him   nor did their prayerfulness  cease after their teacher had left them     there was a pupil in the seminary  who  before conversion  was  exceedingly obstinate and rude  but afterwards  in writing to miss  fiske  she uses expressions like these   i remember how you used to put  your arms about my neck  and tell me how christ became obedient unto  death  not for friends  but for enemies like me  especially do i  remember how you spoke of that love which saw a remedy in its own  blood  when there was no help for a lost world  at that time i did not  understand it  but now i know not how to express my gratitude  i know  that you are very happy with your aged mother  though your heart is  here  and she is happy  too  that she sees your face  yet these earthly  meetings  though so pleasant  are but for a season  but how delightful  will be that meeting with the holy angels  with the risen lamb  and  with god our father  and if separations are so trying here  what must  be those of the last day  may i not then be separated from you  if i  should be  i know you will say   holy  holy lord god  just art thou   for she has been taught   we miss you much  but the teacher who is  better than any earthly instructor  came and taught us this winter               the lord jesus has been the gardener of our school  he has  come down and watered it with heavenly rain  he has truly fulfilled his  promise   i will not leave you orphans  i will come to you   he said    wait for the promise of the father   we waited for his coming  and he  turned himself quickly  and we had delightful seasons  our times of  prayer were longed for  we prayed more than we did any thing else  when  we retire from the school room now  in many places two girls are found  praying together  in my village i meet the women together and alone  i  also have precious seasons  praying with a company of girls  and i have  selected two women to pray with and for till they shall be christians   i hope that they will choose christ for their portion  some of the  women of our village  like mary  sit at jesus  feet  one christian  mother had an only son  and very wicked  who trod the sabbath under  foot  and was wholly given up to his own pleasure  she set apart a day  for fasting and prayer in his behalf  and soon the lord met him in his  evil way  and now he is a decided christian      but let us leave these general views  and look at this prayerfulness  more in the order of its manifestations     during the revival in       two of the pupils spent a whole night in  prayer for the conversion of their brothers  first one leading in  devotion  and then the other  till morning  like jacob they felt   we  will not let thee go except thou bless us   while the missionaries  admired their pious zeal  it is proper to add  that they generally  insisted on the observance of regular hours of sleep  as conducive  alike to bodily and spiritual health  yet one writes on a similar  occasion   sometimes  in my anxiety  i have gone to their cold closets  to persuade them to leave  but the fervor of their prayers has oftener  driven me to mine  than it has allowed me to call them from theirs      twice  and even three times  a day  were not enough for them to retire  for communion with god  many spent hours every day at the mercy seat   there were but few closets  and this was a great trial to them  often  three or four of them might be seen sitting  in tears  waiting their  turn to go in to the mercy seat  would that they might have had some of  those closets at home that are never entered  at another time  the  bible of one of the girls was found on one of their wooden stools  open  at the fifty first psalm  and the page blotted with weeping  as she  read it preparatory to retiring for prayer  her teacher could put her  finger on no part of those large pages without touching a tear      still later  when news of the death of munny  of ardishai  by the  accidental discharge of a gun  reached miss fiske in america  her first  thought was   dear child  i shall never again break off your communion  with jesus   for she remembered that when once she begged her to leave  her closet and get rest for the sabbath  her reply was   o  i am so  sorry that you spoke to me  i was having such a good time with my dear  saviour   only a few days before her death  while in the vineyard with  her brother  she suddenly clasped her hands  and exclaimed   blessed  mr  stoddard  when shall i see him  and when shall i see my blessed  saviour    footnote    see page          a poor woman came to the seminary one day  weeping for her sins  and  seated herself on the floor  the teacher was soon at her side  telling  her of him who was wounded for our transgressions  she prayed with her   and then asked her to pray for herself   but i can t pray  i don t know  your prayers    hatoon  don t try to pray like me  or like any body   but just tell god how you feel and what you want    may i tell god just  what is in my heart   being assured on that point  she fell on her  face  weeping aloud  saying amid sobs   o god  i am not fit even for an  old broom to sweep with   and could say no more  this was doubtless the  most worthless thing the poor woman could think of in her humble home   but it was not long ere she could join others in their little meetings  for prayer  and she still lives  honoring the saviour  whom she loves   she is the mother of two of the most useful graduates of the seminary     again  a pious man brought his wife to spend a few days in the  seminary  when she was somewhat thoughtful  and left her nearly a week   let miss fiske describe their meeting   he came for her at noon  and i  was conversing with him in my room  when she passed out from her closet  without seeing him   the small upper window to the left  over the  central door  marks the closet   but he saw her  and reached out his  hand  saying   my beloved  come here   she placed her hand in his   looked up in his face  and answered his  is christ become beautiful    with a gentle   i  think so   the tears of both fell fast  while he led  her  without leave  into my chamber  that they might unite in prayer   but i was glad to have them offer their first  united  prayers there   it was ever after a more sacred place      miss fiske spent most of the vacation that followed the first revival   in       with mr  stoddard  in the villages  where her pupils aided her  much in labors among the people  after a very pleasant evening spent in  geog tapa with those who were seeking jesus  hanee  the pupil with whom  she staid  came and asked   would you like to be alone   it was the  first time she had ever been asked such a question by a nestorian  and  it awakened feelings similar to those that filled her heart when first  she heard the voice of a nestorian woman leading in prayer  to use her  own words   i followed the dear child  and she led me to the best  closet she could give me  a manger  where she had spread clean hay  and  she said to me  as she turned to leave   stay just as long as you  like   you may well suppose it was a precious spot to me  it was my own  fault if i did not there meet him who was once laid in a manger for us      the members of the seminary were especially interested in the monthly  concert  which was held in oroomiah  on the first monday of the month   on that day they generally wanted two or three meetings  and in      it  was often difficult to persuade them to study at all  from the rising  to the setting sun  the voice of supplication for a dying world  continually fell upon the ear  at one time  all united in pleading for  a world s redemption  then  in little companies of five or six  they  urged the request  and again  each  alone in her closet  still pressed  the same petition     previous to       so few of the nestorians knew how to pray  that  religious meetings were for instruction rather than prayer  but now it  was a delightful privilege to unite with them in pleading for the  conversion of the world to christ  never were their petitions so full  of unction as when offered for this object  in april  miss fiske s  pupils  not satisfied with an extra meeting by themselves  though  continued till near sunset  were induced to close it only by the  promise of having a similar meeting next day  no wonder their teacher  never enjoyed a monthly concert in america as she did that one  it was  indeed a rare privilege to unite with such spirits in its observance     the pupils wrote to the seminary  at south hadley   dear sisters  we  love the monthly concert very much  three hours on that day we meet  together to pray that the kingdom of god may come among us  and among  all the nations of the earth  it is a very sweet day to us  and we love  none so well  except the sabbath      in january        they spent day and night in weeping and prayer   mostly for themselves  as unfit to pray for others  the same was true  of the male seminary  the teachers  the older pupils  and deacons john  and guwergis spent nearly the whole of one night in prayer  and so  burdened were they with the lost condition of their people  and their  own unfaithfulness  that almost all of them gave up their former hope  in christ  and sought anew for pardon  the voice of praise and prayer  was now heard  not only through the day  but frequently during the  night     up to january   th  only two or three of the unconverted in the  seminary showed any concern for salvation  most of them were so  careless and trifling  that their teachers were almost heart broken   but when the retiring bell rung that night  many were so distressed for  sin that they could not heed it  the pious were pleading in behalf of  those out of christ  and many of these last were crying for mercy  one  prayer commenced   o lord  throw us a rope  for we are out in the open  sea  on a single plank  and wave after wave is dashing over us   so  they continued till near midnight  when their teachers constrained them  to retire     at the beginning of february  the other seminary witnessed a remarkable  outpouring of the spirit of prayer  every spare moment of the previous  day  and much of the night  had been devoted to fervent intercession by  those who feared that the spirit of god was about to leave them  so  intense was the feeling  that the ordinary services were suspended  and  at once every closet was filled  yet a majority had no place for  retirement  one of them proposed prayer in the yard  and there  on that  wintry day  for an hour  their earnest cries went up to heaven  all of  the careless were deeply moved  and many dated their conversion from  that day     the work extended to geog tapa  seir  and other villages  from degala   deacon joseph wrote   whenever i went home  i found our house a house  of mourning  after the lamp was put out at night  i could not sleep for  the sounds of prayer and weeping on all sides  in some houses  very  young children had heard their parents pray so much  that they also did  the same  the women  too  had frequent meetings by themselves  one day  i led some men to a place where they could hear women praying within  the latticed window of a house  and  trembling  they begged me to teach  them also how to come to god      the missionaries avoided all stirring appeals to the passions  among a  people so excitable  though the ready performance of every duty  manifested the sincerity of the praying pupils  while it made the  labors of their teachers pleasant     there was not that agonizing wrestling in prayer on the first monday of       that had marked the same day the year before  but the following  week was characterized by unusual tenderness in both seminaries  and  two of the older pupils of the female seminary found no rest except in  their closets     on the evening of the second sabbath in january  miss fiske was not  able to attend the prayer meeting  and remained in her room alone  the  gentle opening of her door announced that the meeting was over  and a  little group passed on hastily  but quietly  to the rooms beyond  she  had just risen to follow  when she heard several voices in earnest  supplication  she turned to the stairway  and there also the sound of  fervent entreaty came up from many closets  while some groped about to  light their lamps  or stirred the dying embers of their fires  what  meant this simultaneous movement to the mercy seat  there had been  nothing unusually exciting in the meeting  and she sat down with the  sweet assurance that it was from above  it was late before the  suppliants left their closets  and retired in perfect silence  but  morning found them resuming the same loved employment  and good news  came of similar blessings from the boys  seminary     that week was one of deep solemnity  the pious pupils devoted every  leisure moment to prayer  their domestic duties were performed  faultlessly  and much earlier than usual  and then they sought their  closets  some spent five hours each day of that week in those sacred  retreats  and when urged to leave for needed sleep  the reply was   for  weeks we have slept  doing nothing for god and souls  how can we sleep  until forgiven      saturday afternoon  several begged leave to give themselves entirely to  prayer for a blessing on the morrow  and never did the teachers more  gladly welcome the approach of holy time  a blessed sabbath followed  such a preparation day  during morning service  almost all were in  tears  at dinner  many seats were vacant  it may seem an exaggeration   but it was literally true  that no voice was heard all that day save  the voice of prayer  miss fiske has never known such a sabbath before   nor since  in the afternoon  the feeling was overpowering  there was no  request for prayer  but unbroken stillness and the perfect performance  of every duty  without a word being said  at the supper table  every  face seemed to say   our meat and drink are not here   some asked to be  excused  but at length all were seated  and the scene that followed can  never be forgotten  all who were previously interested  and more  beside  wept tears of silent sorrow  the blessing was asked  and the  steward    began to help them  himself in tears  but no plate was  touched  for even the uninterested gazed in silent wonder  their  teacher urged them to eat  but one  seizing her hand  said in a voice  too low to be overheard   you would not ask  me  to eat if you knew my  heart   the reply was   i feel just as sure that the lord would have  you eat  as that he would have you pray   they were then besought to  eat  so as to have strength to pray  this touched a tender chord  and  so succeeded  and then they silently withdrew to make that use of their  renovated strength  each hour that night found some at the mercy seat   feeling that to leave off at such a crisis might lessen the blessing    footnote    yohanan  father of esli  see page         two months now passed on  each day furnishing new evidence that those  prayers were heard  there was less of excitement  but no diminution of  interest  to the close of the term  the uniform and sustained  prayerfnlness of those months surprised the beholders  the voice of  supplication was the latest sound of evening  the watchword of  midnight  and the lark song of the dawn  one pupil  nine years of age   after spending two hours in her closet  consented to retire only when  allowed to rise and pray if she awoke during the night  and she was  sure to wake  about three o clock every morning  her earnest pleadings  roused her teachers from repose     the hours of social prayer were full of tenderness  those who heard the  pupils pleading far within the veil  close by the mercy seat  almost  forgot that they were yet on earth  the school  their parents and  relatives  were all affectionately remembered  the hour always seemed  too short  and often closed with such expressions as these   if we have  not been heard here  we will go to our closets  and if not heard there   we will return here  and again go back to our closets  and so continue  to plead for these loved ones to the last   these meetings  though  varied in character  were always of thrilling interest  now there was  an overwhelming sense of sin  as committed against a holy god  and  then  as a ray of hope appeared  a weeping voice would implore  as on  one occasion  that  the holy one would walk over the hills of judea   find golgotha  and let them live   again  the sight of manifold  transgressions prompted the cry   but we fear our sins have covered  golgotha from thy sight  and then are we forever lost   another part of  the same prayer contained the entreaty   lift not the mercy seat from  off the holy ark  to look on the law we have broken  but look into  jesus  grave  and bid us live      in the daily family prayer meetings every inmate of the room was  specially and tenderly remembered  once  when a father had come for his  daughter  and miss fiske went to find her  on opening the door she  heard a prayer for one who had shown little feeling  and in pleading  the sufferings of christ on her behalf  each petition seemed to rise  higher  till every face was turned upward  as if to see him  and the  one who led in devotion involuntarily stretched out her hands to lay  hold of him  saying   come  lord jesus  and save our perishing sister   but if she will not receive thee in this life we must forever rejoice  in her destruction   a striking illustration of intense spiritual  emotion  bringing the heart into sympathy with the whole truth of god    rev  xix         these labors for their impenitent associates  and for those women who  came to the seminary  were full of christ  the hour between supper and  the evening meeting was usually spent in personal labor from room to  room  and the entreaties and prayers  then audible on all sides  made  it delightful to be a stranger in a strange land for jesus  sake  it  was scarcely less affecting when superstitious grandmothers  worldly  mothers  and giddy sisters were prayed with and entreated to come to  christ     the audible prayers of the pupils may trouble some readers  but not  more than they troubled their teacher  she desired more silent  devotion  but mr  stoddard  himself in the habit of praying aloud   looked on it with more favor  and feared to have it checked  soon after  his own conversion  a friend remarked to him   i think you had better  not pray quite so loud   and for days after it he could not pray at  all  he had never thought of others while communing with god  and he  was troubled that others should think of him  even to the last he  continued the practice of praying audibly     miss fiske sometimes spoke to her pupils on the subject  there was one  who spent hours daily in her closet  but her teacher heard all she  said  so  on a fitting opportunity  she suggested to her  in a gentle  way  that she might modify the practice   i will try to pray in a lower  voice   was the reply   but i never thought of anybody s hearing me    that night her voice was more subdued  but her prayer was very short   and soon after midnight her teacher was awakened by the voice of prayer  out on the roof  she stepped out quietly  and there was her pupil  wrapped in a blanket  and thanking the lord for such a place to pray   she continued her devotions till near morning  and the kind teacher had  no heart to interfere any further  mr  stoddard was much amused with  her success  and it may teach all of us  in this matter  to suffer the  holy spirit to divide to every one severally as he will     on another occasion  not liking to assume the responsibility herself   and yet fearing for the health of her pupil  who generally spent a long  time in fervent devotion  she led the physician to the outside of the  door  but he  too  after listening for a while  did not venture to  interrupt such communion with god  sarah of tiary was within     meetings were held three days in the week with the women in the  neighborhood  and were well attended  the older pupils were allowed to  assist in these in order to form habits of doing good for after life   and they did so to edification  both leading in prayer and addressing  the beloved mothers  as they called those older than  themselves  tenderly and in fitting words     it was of such a work that miss fiske wrote at the time   we cannot  speak confidently of its fruits at this early date  especially as many  of our dear charge are so young  but we can say what present  appearances are  and while we daily try to obey our saviour s command    feed my lambs   we trust that friends at home will hear no less  distinctly the same voice  saying   pray for my lambs in persia   all  those whom we regarded as christians have shown themselves most  faithful to their master during this season  others  of whom we were  less confident  have seemed to pass through a previously untried  experience  and  we tremblingly hope  have laid hold of eternal life   the same is true of several never before convicted  among these last is  a little girl who was suddenly awakened  with as clear convictions   apparently  as i ever saw in any  and her final trust in christ as  implicit  for several days she would say  with tears and sobs   i have  never yet loved the saviour  but o  i do want to love him now   her  mother is one of the few converted in geog tapa before the first  revival  she has suffered almost every thing for christ  often  on  returning late from meeting  she has found herself shut out for an hour  in a piercing winter wind  before her husband would open the door  at  other times she has been beaten  but never denied him who bought her   the pious natives often say that in the conversion of her daughter  she  now receives the reward of her years of prayer and faithful endurance   the last days of the term bound the dear pupils very closely to each  other  and we trust to christ  when the hour of separation came  a  prayer meeting was held in each room  and continued to the last moment   those without hope clung to their praying sisters  with tears and  entreaties for prayer  the hopeful converts went forth with a holy   chastened gratitude and trust  we tremble for them among their wicked  friends  but rejoice that israel s shepherd will keep his own      their prayer was   may we not carry to our homes the poison of the  second death in our hearts  but bear to them the seeds of eternal life      but the rich blessings bestowed in oroomiah were not all in answer to  prayer ascending from that place  there was a connection between them  and prayer offered in our own country  of which david would say   whoso  is wise  and will observe it  even he shall understand the loving  kindness of the lord   most of the revivals in oroomiah commenced on  the day of the monthly concert of prayer  and several on or immediately  after the first monday in january  a day specially set apart to prayer  for missions  but there was a special centre of prayer for the female  seminary in the institution at south hadley  and pious hearts loved to  watch the connection between the two  while the two inquirers  on that  first monday in       were making closets for themselves with the  sticks of wood in the cellar  some of miss lyon s pupils distinctly  remember how she said to them that morning   we must pray more for miss  fiske and her school   they did so  and they remember  too  how the  good news of the revival cheered them  when it came     the earliest indication of interest  in       was on the first monday  in january  and letters afterwards told of special prayer for the  school offered that day in south hadley  almost every letter written  during the winter of      contained similar information  the revival of       came suddenly and unexpectedly  but when  on the night of february    th  one of the praying pupils could not sleep  because  as she said    the whole school was resting on her   and at midnight went to her  teacher to ask her help in prayer  subsequent letters from america  showed  that on that night she wrestled not alone  in       the first  inquiry for the way of life was on the last thursday in february  the  day of prayer for institutions of learning  miss fiske returned from  the february concert of prayer  in       feeling depressed on account  of the want of interest in the school  and in half an hour was called  to see two of her pupils  who felt that they could not remain the  enemies of god  in the first week of february        meetings were held  every evening in the seminary at south hadley to pray for the school in  oroomiah  and a letter from miss rice  written that week  says   god is  with us  souls are seeking christ  and i am so strengthened for labor   that i am sure christian friends are praying for us more than they did  last month   do christians in this country realize as they ought the  connection between their prayers and the blessings bestowed on the  opposite side of the globe  do we go to the monthly concert believing  that prayer  offered then and there  will  through infinite grace in  christ jesus  result in the salvation of souls and the advancement of  his kingdom  such facts as these ought surely to increase our faith   well might a missionary say   i have so often felt sure that i was  reaping in answer to the prayers of those far away  that on this  subject my heart is full  and my first and last word to friends is    pray for us             chapter xvii       forerunners     mountain girls in seminaky   praying sarah   return to the  mountains   visit of yonan and khamis  in        of mr  coan        of  yonan  again         sarah s letters     but rich as are the benefits conferred on the females of the plain  the  influence of the seminary is not confined to persia  it has climbed the  rugged steeps of kurdistan  and pours into its wild glens and secluded  hamlets the same spiritual blessings  it is delightful to trace the way  in which god has led to results  as yet only beginning to appear  among  the mountain nestorians     as the seminary could not enter the mountains  providence brought the  mountains to the seminary  in       badir khan beg sacked and burned  the villages of tiary  and the homeless fugitives who escaped the sword  fled to the plains of assyria and azerbijan  towards the close of that  year  a miserable group presented themselves at the seminary door for  charity  asking for the lady who teaches nestorian girls  the quick eye  of the teacher detected three in the company before her  and replied    silver and gold we have not  but such as we have we will give you  a  home for these children   this sent them away sorrowful  for it was not  what they wanted  but while the parents retired to the shade of the  tall sycamores to debate the matter  the little ones  attracted by  kindness in a stranger  staid with their new friend  by and by the  parents came back  and  falling on the necks of their children  told  them they might stay  till they returned to tiary  the teacher never  heard a more gentle and subdued  thank you  than this announcement  called forth from those mountain girls  this was the first movement of  the school towards the evangelization of kurdistan  and it will be seen  how providence led the seminary at seir in the same path     the girls were taken in  washed  and clothed  and though at first they  knew no more of good manners than of the alphabet  they made  commendable progress in both  better than that  sarah and nazeo became  hopefully pious in the revival of       and heleneh three years  afterwards     the last days of the spring term  in       as we have seen  were full  of interest  the teachers did not understand it then  but now they see  that god was preparing his first messengers to the rude mountaineers  for the work before them  among a company of praying ones  sarah had  long been known as  the praying sarah   she was the pupil whom deacon  isaac invited to come and pray     footnote    see page       with him   and the strong man bowed before the simple piety of that mountain girl   her mind was not so gifted as many of her associates  she comprehended  truth with difficulty  but she prayed with all prayer and supplication  in the spirit  at this time an unusual spirit of prayer was imparted to  the school  the prospect of vacation  instead of diverting the mind  from devotion  seemed to produce intenser earnestness  the voice of  prayer fell on the ears of the teachers at all hours  except the most  silent watch of the night  after the evening meeting  some spent two  hours in their closets  and others of the older pupils could not leave  till they had prayed with each one in the school alone  on the last  morning of the term  they separated with many tears and fervent  supplications  the quiet of the hour seemed a foretaste of the rest of  heaven  not a loud voice  heavy step  or harshly shutting door was  heard in all the house  all was so sacredly quiet that the still small  voice might be heard the more distinctly  the teachers sent out the  lambs from the fold with feelings of peculiar anxiety  some were to go  into families where every soul would gladly undo in them the work of  the spirit  others to villages where not one heart could enter into  their feelings as the followers of christ  and as they went forth   their teachers prayed  from full hearts  that the shepherd of israel  would himself be to them for a little sanctuary in the places where  they went     while their thoughts were on such of their flock as belonged to the  plain  the thoughts of god were on those also whom he was about to send  forth to a life long separation from these means of grace  as late as  ten o clock  on the evening after the close of the term  miss fiske  heard the voice of prayer for the absent ones  and fearing that the  occupant of the closet was transgressing the laws of health  she  approached the door  intending to enter  and advise her to retire  but  as she listened to her strong crying  with tears  for each of the  school by name  she could not find it in her heart to disturb the  intercessions of sarah  she was then a great bodily sufferer  but very  patient  and for a long time had not spent less than four hours daily  in her closet  the next day her disease assumed a serious form  and for  more than a week she hovered on the borders of the grave  several times  she appeared to have drawn her last breath  but though her sick room  seemed to all like the gate of heaven  and though to her the dark  valley was all light  and she longed to embrace the messenger who  should lead her through  it was not her father s will to call her then   she was at first disappointed at the prospect of coming back to the  world  yet still she sweetly said   thy will be done   as god restored  her to health  with its responsibilities and temptations     april came  and a scarcity in the plain  occasioned by locusts  drove  the fugitives from tiary back to their mountains  the teachers hoped  the girls might remain  and besought their parents to allow them to do  so  but in vain  they were only too glad to get their daughters away  from influences which in their blindness they abhorred  but god  intended through these daughters to lay the foundations of many  generations  and build again the old waste places of those mountains     it was hard for them to go  how could they leave their christian home   and the means of grace they had enjoyed so much  it was no less hard  for the teachers to think of those lambs as about to be left at the  mercy of wolves  in rocky glens  so far away that no cry of distress  would ever reach them  yea  even if those loved ones died  long years  might pass ere their friends could hear of their death  those were days  of sadness  and communion with god was the only comfort of all  and  especially of sarah     on the day of their departure  the whole school came together  in the  room of the teachers  for the parting prayer  all was silent  till the  three asked to go and bid a farewell to their closets  they went  and  only he who seeth in secret knows how they prayed  they returned  weeping  a few words of comfort were uttered  and the teachers  commended them to god  they rose from their knees  but only to kneel  again  for one of the pupils proposed that all who would pledge  themselves to remember their tiary sisters in every prayer should join  hands around them  commend them to the good shepherd  and give to him  their pledge  about twenty thus enclosed the departing sisters  and so  they continued in prayer until the last moment  as the dear ones passed  out  they could not speak  they whispered but one word    the  promise    and so they went  for years after  no prayer was heard  within those walls that did not contain a petition for  blessings on  our tiary sisters      many a time had her teacher noticed the large folio page of sarah s  syriac testament wet with her tears  and after she left  found the  whitewash of the wall in her closet furrowed with the same  it opened  out of the passage behind the door on the left of the engraving  she  did not tell this to the school  lest superstition should attach an  idolatrous sacredness to the place  and yet she could not obliterate  marks that to her own heart were so full of comfort  sarah had gone but  a little way before she pleaded with her parents to stop  and allow her  to retire a little from the road for prayer     and so  weeping and praying as they went  these lambs were led into the  dark recesses of a den of lions  we shall see persecution raging   pitiless as the mountain storm  and long continued  but we shall also  see the hearer of prayer preserving them unharmed  and if we hear more  from the others than from sarah  it may be that the revelation of the  answers to her prayers is reserved for that day which shall unfold  displays of grace too glorious for comprehension here     nothing was heard from them till october        when yonan and khamis  entered those rocky fastnesses to gather tidings of them  they spent  the first sabbath of the month in the house of nazee  but she was  absent  they say in their journal        we preached three times to large assemblies  they brought us nazee s  testament to preach from  and seemed accustomed to the sound of the  gospel  in respectful attention to the word  as well as in knowledge   they were far superior to other villages in tiary  this we knew was the  result of her teachings  monday we waited her return  she came about  noon  how can we express the joy of that meeting  we spent another  night there  the most of it in sweet christian conversation with nazee   we were surprised at the respect shown to her  and the restraint felt  in her presence  if any chanced to swear  he at once went and asked  pardon for thus injuring her feelings  tuesday we had to leave  lest we  should be detained by the snow till spring  we longed to pray with her  before we left  but custom here forbade it  yet she accompanied us a  little on our way  which gave as an opportunity to mingle our prayers  and tears together  as we bade her farewell  she said  weeping   here  is my love for my teachers  for my sisters in the school  for the  missionaries  their children  and all that know me  tell them to  remember me in their prayers  that god may keep me in this place of  temptation   we left her looking after us  and wiping away her tears   till we were out of sight      we went that day to the village of the other two  as soon as heleneh  saw us  she began to weep  thinking of the past  sarah we did not see   she was in another village  very anxious to come  but her wicked  husband  whom she had been forced to marry  would not permit it  we  spent the night with heleneh  and preached to a large company  next  morning we left  and she too  with tears  begged that all her friends  in oroomiah would remember her in their prayers      was sarah prevented from seeing her christian friends  that god might  show hereafter how  without even that help  he could answer the prayers  of others for her  and her own     the next we hear of them is through mr  coan  who visited tiary in  august        the writer can understand his account of crossing the  zab  as the bridge was in the same condition when he crossed it with  the late dr  azariah smith  august   st        but hear mr  coan        a toilsome day  over the roughest of roads  brought us opposite  chumba  the bridge had been swept away  and fording such a torrent was  impossible  two long poplar trees spanned the flood  and we crossed on  them  bending under us at every step  nazee was on the bank  ready to  greet us  after a few words of salutation and kind inquiry  she  hastened to prepare a place for us  and while doing this  the malik  took us to his house  she was much disappointed  but followed  anxious  to treasure up every word  after supper  we spoke long to the company  assembled on the roof  it was affecting to see how eagerly she  listened  she staid after the rest  for religious conversation  till  near midnight  when she apologized for keeping us up so late  she is  cruelly persecuted by her wicked mother and ungodly neighbors  for she  is a shining light  by which the dark deeds of the wicked are reproved   and hence their hatred  when mar shimon s attendants come  they treat  her with wanton cruelty  some friends in america had sent her several  articles of clothing  but her neighbors came together and tore them in  pieces before her eyes  she bore it meekly  and only prayed for them   she expected fresh insults because of our visit  but prayed that  nothing might separate her from the love of christ  long before day   she again sought to improve every moment for christian conversation  we  tried to comfort her  and her eyes filled with tears of gratitude  she  received a copy of the gospels with joy  when we left  she followed us   lonely and sad  to the river side  i opened her testament  and pointed  to matt  xi       come unto me  all ye that labor  and are heavy  laden   but her voice choked  and tears prevented her reading  we  kneeled by the roaring zab  and in broken accents commended her to him  who will keep her  for his promise is sure      for ten long years we hear nothing of either of the three  till  in  september        yonan  the same who found them in       and another  preacher visited the mountains  in a village of tiary  some two  thousand people were keeping the feast of the cross  eating  drinking   dancing  and carousing  they sat down among the quietest of the crowd   heleneh came up and saluted them  though she had not seen her teacher  for eleven years  she recognized him at once  they talked from morning  till near sunset  as they spoke of old friends  yonan asked   heleneh   do you remember where our lord was crucified    on calvary  can i  forget  calvary    as though grieved that he should think she could  forget  yonan gave her a kerchief for the head  saying   take this  and  remember me by it    shall i remember you by this   was the reply   i  will remember you in my prayers    do you pray  heleneh    she was the  last one converted  and left oroomiah soon after her conversion  so he  wanted to know whether she still held on her christian way    always    was the answer  they sought a place to pray together  and though they  might not go away alone  yet there  in sight  but not in hearing of the  crowd  they approached the mercy seat  the spectators little dreaming  of the nature of their intercourse  it was delightful to find that she  had not forgotten the language or the spirit of devotion     the accompanying sketch of a tiary girl will show how the kerchief is  worn  it also exhibits the mode of using the oriental spindle  which is  probably a facsimile of the article mentioned by solomon   prov  xxxi            illustration  a tiary girl     the other two were not at the feast  so  next day  they left to seek  them at their homes  nazee was absent  but came home in the morning  a  widow with two children  she was delighted  and even her children  seemed to recognize in the strangers their mother s friends  she was  poor  her house had been burned  and almost all it contained  but a  stone was on her testament  and that was saved  they talked long with  her  and gave her a copy of the rays of light  the monthly periodical  issued by the mission   and a pencil to write to her friends  she gave  them letters written ten years before  which she had penned in secret   and carried about with her ever since  waiting an opportunity to send  them     the next day  another long journey brought them to the home of sarah   she saw them coming and hastened to meet them  but that very night she  had to leave for a distant village  yet not till in answer to prayer  they had an opportunity to pray together  and the friends left that  village happy  for  as yonan said  they  found her  like the others   having the love of our christ in her heart      that solitary disciple  through those long years of seclusion  never  hearing the voice of christian fellowship  or knowing whether her pious  friends were alive  or if her sisters still remembered their pledge   was yet kept of god according to his promise  and it is interesting to  see that she does not once allude to her persecutions in her letters   but only solicits the prayers of her friends for her relatives and  neighbors  and then  while both mr  coan and her teacher testify to her  usefulness  with what humility does she allude to herself  and  the  very little she has made known of the lord jesus christ      extracts from the letters that she kept so long here follow  the first   to friends in middlebury  vermont  is dated september        and reads  thus        to you  dear friends  i write a letter unworthy and imperfect  in  which i make known to you my lost condition and my present abode  know  ye that a little more than two years ago i left the seminary  and came  with my friends to our country  i did not wish to leave so soon  for i  had learned but very imperfectly what the scriptures teach about our  lord jesus christ  but my mother was not willing i should remain  for  her heart is yet hard and dark  know  then  dear sisters in christ  i  dwell in tiary  in the village of chumba  about six days  journey from  oroomiah  again  though so far away  know ye  that your letter reached  me in may  it was translated and sent to me by mr  perkins  our beloved  father  whom we are unworthy to call such  my dear sisters  when i took  your letter in my hands and read  my heart longed to fly and sit down  by you  and behold your faces in the body  but i said   the will of the  lord  not mine  be done   when i look within myself  and see not a  place worthy to cherish gratitude to god for his great mercy and grace   which he hath wrought for us  sinful and unworthy  i liken myself to  the slothful servant  who did not the will of his lord  yet  o  my  sisters  though i have not done the will of my saviour  i have hope in  him that i shall do it  and serve him henceforth so long as i am in  this world  fleeting as a dream in the night     though our country has been  in time past  greatly afflicted by the  koords  yet god has spared many of us  who had sinned and trodden under  our feet the blood of his holy son  but do not marvel that we have  sorrow from the scourge god brought upon us for our sins  no  still  every day we provoke our maker more and more  then ought we not to  mourn over this people  lost and fallen under the yoke of satan  for  should you go through all tiary  you would not find one soul that fears  the lord  but all bound in fetters not to be loosed  if god do not  loose them  quickly will they perish  and not this country only  but  many others  sit under the shadow of death and walk in darkness  going  to destruction  then  dear sisters  though unworthy  we should increase  our painful efforts  and our prayers to god  that speedily his kingdom  may come and his will be done on earth as it is done in heaven  that  all regions may know him and praise him forever  beloved sisters  i am  unworthy to thank you  and still more to thank god  who has disposed  you to show such kindness to my poor body  and yet more to my perishing  soul  with words so gentle and full of love  yet greatly do i thank you     again  dear friends  i have one request to make  that every time you  bow before god  the father of our lord jesus christ  and of all who  love him  you will remember me in your prayers  for i am very needy   and there is great danger that my soul will perish forever  remember  also my mother  and all my friends  sinners  and on their way to  destruction  know ye  further  that i conceal the writing of this  because they would not allow me openly to write  for they are very  foolish and benighted  accept  then  this poor letter  as a token of  friendship and gratitude  in the love of our lord jesus christ     from your unworthy and sinful sister     nazre  of tiary  amen     the following are extracts from another letter to the same persons        though we are far from each other in this evil world  yet i hope that  our lord jesus christ will make us pure from sin  and worthy of his  kingdom  where we shall see each other with that light which shall not  end  in the joy of the holy angels  ah  my friends  how great are our  mercies and we how unworthy  but especially i   unworthy of the gift of  the gospel of god  which i have received  that i might make it known to  lost souls around me  but know ye  very little have i made known about  our lord jesus christ  now  dear friends  i desire to speak of him to  lost souls  in the imperfection of my mind  but many do not desire even  to hear of the sound doctrine of the lord jesus christ  and yet think  to gain heaven  while they practise in this world according to their  wicked desires  and for this reason  o my sisters  i beseech you that  you will remember this people  lost and fallen under the snares of  satan  especially my mother  and brother  and all my friends  but more  especially  i beseech you to remember me  a sinner  in your prayers   every time that you bow the knee before god  the father of our lord  jesus christ  and the father of all who fear him  and listen to his  commandments      accompanying these was the following to dr  perkins  dated october  d               to you  o my spiritual father  mr  perkins  i presume to send two  letters  for friends in middlebury  if you please  you will translate  them  and send them  but i fear that they will give you much trouble      again  you wrote me in your letter  that i should teach children to  read  now  i am very needy myself of instruction  yet i desire that  that might be my employment  but that is a very difficult matter among  such a people  of whom you have heard that although there may be here  and there one who would walk in this way  yet there is a stone of  stumbling and a rock of offence therein  so that every one that goeth  in it  his foot stumbleth  and quickly he turns back      again  o friend beloved  though i am unworthy to call you such  yet i  beseech you that you remember me always in your prayers  i know that  you do remember me  but i desire that you remember me more  for i  greatly fear for my perishing soul  greatly do i desire to see you once  more in this world  if the lord will      he who is wonderful in counsel and excellent in working  commissioned  these praying souls to prepare his way in the mountains  even as he  chose those other three to show forth his grace in death  and they who  live to mark the future course of the river of life in those rocky  glens will find  we trust  that his strength was made perfect in their  weakness           chapter xviii       laborers in the mountains     letter of badal   account of hannah   the pit    letter of guly and  yohanan   account of sarah   letters of oshana   letters and journal of  sarah   letter fkom amadia   conference of native helpers     besides these  the seminary has sent up other laborers into the same  field  at the monthly concert in oroomiah  june        there were  present four graduates  with their husbands  either going there for the  first time  or returning to resume their labors  guly  the wife of  yohanan  who had already spent one year in little jeloo  was now about  to return there with her husband  nargis  the wife of khamis  who had  spent the winter laboring alone in the vicinity of amadia  on the  turkish side of the mountains  was now with him  going back to gawar   hannah  the wife of badal  who had sent her husband  three days after  marriage  to his winter s campaign in the same region  was now  accompanying him to the chosen field of his labors  and eneya  the wife  of shlemon  his associate  was also expecting to leave in a few days     by the way of introducing the reader to one of these laborers  we  subjoin a letter from badal to miss fiske  dated december   th         it is a good specimen of oriental style      writing to you brings to mind many sweet conversations with you   dwelling on them  my mind is sad  my sighs rise like the swelling  stream  and almost carry me away  especially when i look at your  garden  where you labored with so much skill to graft in these wild  olive plants  cutting off your sleep with watchings by night  that they  should not be rooted up by the desert wind  thus you watched them  till  they became as noble forest trees that not even the avalanche can  overturn  your garden  now  not only gives a shade pleasant to the  traveller  but it yields sweet fruits  clouds rise from it that give us  the early and the latter rain  they empty themselves   the plain  rejoices  and the barren places become verdant  yes  the vine that you  planted has budded  and blossomed  and gives of its fruit to every  passer by  come to us  our beloved  open the door of your garden  that  the traveller may enter in and be refreshed  you have left many  pleasant remembrances in the work of your hands  on every side you have  left a picture for our eyes  and the skilful work of your hands  his  wife   lo  and behold  it is with me  i cannot be silent  my voice  shall be heard as the turtle s   behold  your feet are within my doors   and your counsels are ever in my family   the lord reward you for these  pupils  that you have taught to be patient and persevering  so that  they truly help us in the work of life      beloved  give my love to your friends  and ask them  when they go up  to shiloh to offer sacrifice  to place me in the censer of their  prayers      we are troubled that as yet we know not the lord s thoughts concerning  you   whether he will allow you to meet your flock again  or says to  you as to daniel   thou shalt rest  and stand in thy lot at the end of  the days   like moses  you are gathered to your fathers  but miss rice  stands like joshua  commanding the sun not to go down till the sword of  the gospel shall triumph  we thank the lord that she is still a judge  in israel  so that as yet the sceptre has not departed from judah      your affectionate friend  badal      there are some things about hannah  and the work of divine grace in  her  that demand grateful record     she was the daughter of one of the most intelligent and wealthy  nestorians  who placed her in the seminary as early as       she was  then quite small  and the teacher objected very much to taking her  but  paternal importunity prevailed  as soon as her father turned to go  she  began to scream  but he left  saying she must remain  and  learn  wisdom   the kind teacher took her in her lap to soothe her  but it was  of no use  her bleeding hands bore the marks of the nails of her new  protegee for weeks  she called for her father  but he was intentionally  out of hearing     the child remained  but learned wisdom very slowly  she had her fits of  rage so often  that she was sent home sometimes for weeks  and again  for months  she made little progress  either in study or other good   till the winter of       when she seemed to begin to love the truth   yet  though her general deportment was correct  she often showed such a  determined will  that her instructors feared she had never said from  the heart   not my will  but thine   and often told her that  if she  was a christian  god would  in love  subdue that will  she could not  feel her need of this  and thought that they required too much of her   so they were obliged to leave her with god  and he cared for her in an  unusual way  the mission premises had formerly been occupied by an  oriental bath  and here and there were old pits  once used for carrying  off the water  but now covered up  so that no one knew where they were   one evening miss fiske called the girls together  and told them some  things she wished they would refrain from  they promised compliance   and went out  but hardly had they gone before their teacher heard the  cry   hannah is in the well   she ran there  but all was right  then  they led her to an opening just before the back door  saying   the  earth opened and swallowed her up   the covering of one of the pits had  given way  and she had fallen perhaps twenty feet below the surface   fortunately  as in the case of joseph  there was no water in the pit   and in a few days she was able to resume her place in school  but much  more gentle and subdued than ever before  the change was marked by all   months after  in a private interview with her teacher  she gave an  account of the whole matter  she said the girls went out  most of them  saying   we will obey our teachers   but she  stamping her foot  said    i did right before  and i shall do so again   with these words on her  lips  she sunk into the earth  at first she did not know what had  happened  but remembered all that had been said  and felt that god was  dealing with her  lying there helpless and bruised at the bottom of the  pit  she made a solemn vow to god   never again my will   from that  time she was a most lovely example of all that was gentle  she seemed  to give up every thing  and  bear all things   her father saw the  change  and one day said to her teachers   i am not a christian  but  hannah knows nothing but god s will  if she should die now  i should  know she was with christ  she is so like him   her christian character  developed beautifully  the school learned of her to be christ like  she  longed to do good  and was ready to make any sacrifice for the good of  souls  when badal sought her hand from her father  the latter called  her  and said   hannah  badal the son of the herdsman  wants you to go  to the mountains with him  and wants you to live here with him  it  shall be as you say   she replied very meekly   i wish to suffer with  the people of god  i choose to go with badal   and june  th        she  left for her mountain home     the parting prayer meeting with those four girls  going as missionaries  to the mountains  was one of the pleasantest memories that miss fiske  carried away from oroomiah  she left soon after  but often heard from  hannah and her companions that she was happy in her life of privation  for jesus  sake  and did what she could  she suffered  however  from  the change  and was advised to visit oroomiah for her health  it was  hoped she might soon recover  but she went only to leave her sweet  testimony to the blessedness of knowing no will but god s  and then go  home  she sent the following messages to miss fiske from her dying bed    i love to have god do just as he pleases  i thank you for all your  love  and especially for showing me my saviour   she died in december            having given herself to missionary work among the mountains  it is  interesting to know that her little property also went to the same  object  in the remarkable revival of benevolence  in oroomiah  in the  spring of       her brother gave her inheritance  which had fallen to  him  to sustain laborers in the mountains  thus  after her life had  been laid down in the work  all her living went to carry it on     let guly introduce herself to the reader by giving her own account of  her conversion  in            my dear superintendent  miss fiske  i wish now  as far as i can  to  describe to you my spiritual state  the first four weeks of the revival  i did not realize that i was lost  but afterwards was more burdened  my  sins were round about me like dark clouds  one night i went to miss  rice to have her pray with me  i did not know how to find christ  she  told me  yet all that night i saw no light  but only darkness  i was  almost in despair  yet felt that this was from satan  in the morning  the sun rose pleasantly  but it was as night to me  for i knew that i  had no portion in god  so i continued all that day  i could not read in  my class  but went to my room  and vowed not to leave it till i had  some token that christ was mine  i brought nothing in my hands save my  sins  which were like mountains  i remembered that scripture   though  your sins be as scarlet  they shall be as white as snow   and i  recalled the promises of god  and that no other could pardon me  with  earnest longing  i laid my soul into the hands of jesus  i heartily  covenanted to serve him all my life  and sought help from him in  prayer  then suddenly i saw light  as if he were at my side  and i did  not wish to rise from my knees  so blessed was that communion  from  that time i had hope  but sometimes fear i may be deceived  yet daily i  find christ more and more precious  though old adam is not dead  yet in  the strength of god i will resist him     yes  my dear mother in christ  my guide to the cross  my desire is to  please god  and live for him  not for myself  i cannot say that i shall  never sin  for i am weak  and my foe is strong  but i will seek help  from him who was tempted  and can succor me when tempted     i am most thankful to you that you have been the means of my salvation   and can never forget your love till my tongue is silent in the grave     your affectionate guly  of seir     she and her husband  yohanan  have labored in the mountains ever since  their marriage  he writes to miss fiske in february              i have not forgotten your pleasant love  and trust i never shall until  i die  i hope that  with all your friends here  i shall see you again   as our joy is not full in your absence  may you not rest till you  return      we are now in vizierawa of gawar  for the people of ishtazin   instigated by mar shimon  have cast us out  i had hoped to go to  amadia  but was robbed and wounded  in the autumn  by the koords  and  before i could recover my goods  it was too late to go so far  so i  remain here  and  thanks to god  our labor in the gospel is more  pleasant than ever  some of the men wish to hear the whole will of god   and women and girls come to guly to hear his words  a few children also  are constant in learning to read  the work of god prospers this year in  gawar  and the laborers are more numerous and more faithful      in estimating the zeal and self denial of these nestorian missionaries   it should be borne in mind that our missionaries there  think it  requires as much self denial for a native of oroomiah to go to the  mountains  as for an american to go to oroomiah  and according to the  testimony of a native observer  the married graduates of the seminary   in the mountains  are centres of light in that great sea of darkness     besides those already mentioned  oshana and sarah  with shlemon and  eneya  are laboring in amadia  this sarah is daughter of priest  abraham  of geog tapa  and was one of the earliest pupils of the  seminary  when deacon isaac broke it up  in       she was the only  pupil who remained  she was hopefully converted in       and while in  the seminary was supported by the sabbath school in owego  new york     in       it was proposed that her father labor in ardishai  one of the  darkest and most wicked villages of the plain  as one might expect the  home of the notorious mar gabriel would be  great opposition was made  by the people to his coming among them  and his own wife  not then  converted  did much to hinder his going  but sarah did all in her power  to encourage him  and a letter of hers on the subject decided him to  go  she rejoiced to give up her friends  her pleasant home  and even  her privileges  that he might labor in that unpromising field  nor was  she by any means idle  she spent all her vacations there  laboring with  much acceptance and success  and after she graduated  in       besides  her day school through the week  she had a bible class on the sabbath   with the women  and on friday  also  she sent out her pupils  in the  afternoon  to invite their mothers and other women to a meeting she  held with them in the evening  she thus acquired great influence  and  led several to the saviour  her labors were very systematic  she had a  plan for conversing personally with one pupil each day  and was noted  for her tact and success in efforts with individuals  others might act  from impulse  and soon tire  but hers is an activity controlled by  principle  and therefore uniform and enduring  very faithful in  admonition when admonition is required  she is at the same time noted  for gentleness  and thus expresses to miss fiske her delight in  laboring for christ   separated from christian friends  i am sometimes  sad  but i am not greater than my master  who left the holy society of  heaven to come to earth  and i am glad for a corner where i may labor  for such a master  come and spend a sabbath here if you can  if not   pray much and often for these poor women   again speaking of her  school  she says   it is the goodness of god that gives me these little  girls  pray for them  i see indications that they will be lovers of the  lord  forty or fifty of the women come to meeting  and twenty two are  willing to receive the truth   she was accustomed to study the bible  with her father  and in that way also aided him in his labors     but it is time to bring forward her husband  in letters which open up a  new department of usefulness  and illustrate the meaning of mar  yohanan  when he brought her first pupils to miss fiske  and said   no  man take them from you   the truth was  that the same parents  who at  first could not trust their daughters in the seminary for a single  night  were now unwilling that they should be united to a husband who  did not commend himself to its teachers as a suitable companion for  their pupils  but let oshana speak       honored lady  miss fiske  i have a petition to lay before your zeal   which is active in doing good to all poor insignificant ones like me   dear lady  whose love is like the waters of the nile  and spreads more  than they  for it reaches the sons of the mountains of kurdistan  as  well as those of the plain  i am venturing to trouble you more than  ever before  this summer  when i went to my country  tehoma   my mother  and uncles  who greatly love me  with a natural love  beset me to marry  one of the daughters of my country  whomsoever i should please  but i  made known to them that i wished  if possible  to take one of the  pupils of your school  for i said to them   if i take one of these who  are so wicked  ignorant  immodest  and disorderly  they will embitter  my life    i entreated of them not to put this yoke of iron on my neck   they listened a little to my petition  from the mercy of god  but made  me promise that if it should reach my hand  i would marry this winter   the girl on whom i have placed my eye  to take her  is sarah  because  she has the  fear of god  which is the beginning of wisdom   and she  has been brought up in all the graces of christianity  and has well  learned the holy doctrines  and in the fear of god  and the knowledge  she has acquired  she can help me  and strengthen me  in the work of  god  on which i have placed my heart for life     and now  to whom shall i look to help me in this matter  i will look to  god  the lord of heaven and earth  but he works by instruments  then to  whom shall i look  as the instrument to do this work  i am a stranger   poor  and without a name here  my relatives are far away  if i have  friends in oroomiah  they cannot do this kindness for me  if i remain  silent  silence alone shall i see  now  my lady  i look to you for  help  and with confidence shall i do so more than i should to my  parents  for you have guided me and my sister better than any  nestorians have guided their children  yes  by your hand god will  supply my need  now do as you think proper  from your unworthy    oshana     p s  the other letter  enclosed  is for sarah  and on this subject     some time after he was engaged to her  she was very sick  when he wrote  as follows  and the reader will notice that the  honored lady  gives  place to    dear mother  and nourisher of sarah  i have no friend in whose  pleasant  pure love i can delight as in sarah  and she is now wasting  away on a bed of sickness  my heart is very heavy with sorrow on her  account  yes  i am so borne down with trouble  that for three days my  tears have not been stayed  i do not say this to boast of my love  i  owe her all this  i have a petition to make  which is  that you will do  all you can for sarah  but i need not ask this  for i am confident that  your kindness  will lead you to do  and cause to be done  all that can  be done for her  but will you not let me know whether her sickness  increases or diminishes   if it increases  that my sighs and tears may  increase in pleading before the lord for mercy  and if it diminishes   that my thanksgivings may increase before our merciful father in heaven     dear mother  if it is the will of our father in heaven to take sarah to  the upper mansions   though i shall be comforted on account of her  being saved from all the bitter misery of this world  and her blessed  rest with the saviour  where she can praise his love with her pleasant  voice  joined with the sweet songs of angels   still it will be hard  for me  if i live after she has gone  god forbid that i behold her  dust  and not long to be her companion in heaven  your unworthy    oshana     our next letter is from sarah to miss fiske  written at seir  in        more than two years after her marriage  and gives a good idea of her  christian spirit       beloved  the good news that you gave us of the revivals in your  country  rouses our hearts to warmer zeal  shall we not also prepare  the way of the lord  we know  by the gracious visits of god here this  winter  that christians there are ever praying for our poor people  for  we hear from the preachers who come up to the concert every month  that  the work of the lord goes forward in the villages of the plain  and  also in the mountains     here in seir  the good work began among the women  i hear them say    though we have had revivals before  we have never seen a year like  this  when the words of god had such deep effect   mrs  cochran and i  have good meetings with these women  our congregations make glad the  christian heart  and i am particularly happy in laboring for them  one  by one  a portion of them  with tearful eyes  are covenanting to be the  lord s  we ask the lord to strengthen them in their covenant  and we  entreat of you and of your friends to pray for them     our sabbath schools are very pleasant  mr  cochran will tell you how  the work goes forward  mrs  cochran has a class of women  and so have  i  last sabbath mr  cochran read one of your letters to the  congregation  and we learned from it how the work of the lord goes  forward in your blessed churches  we praised the lord  and then we  entreated him to bless our churches  and make them more spiritual  for  we are confident that his grace is sufficient for us all     she visited tehoma  in may  two months after the date of the preceding   with her husband  oshana  and two little children  and gives the  following account of their journey        through the favor of our heavenly father  i have made a journey into  these mountains  rejoicing in the opportunity to labor for my people  i  am very happy that my father and friends brought me on my way in  willingness of soul  from the day that i left my own country  in every  place that i have entered  until now  my heart has been excited to  praise my guide and my deliverer  and i have also been grateful to my  teachers who brought me to labor in a desolate vineyard  joyfully  i   who am so weak  and such a great sinner  in all the various  circumstances in which i have been  your counsels have been of great  benefit to me      i think you will be glad to know that the gospel door is wide open  here  you and your friends will pray that the lord of the harvest would  send forth laborers into his harvest      we left the city of oroomiah  may  th  we were ten souls  hormezd  of  aliawa  sagoo  of geog tapa  matlub  the tehomian  guly  and little  gozel  oshana and his brother  our two little girls  and myself  may   th  we reached memikan  and remained there three days      it was our first sabbath in the mountains  i met that company of women  for whom our departed mrs  rhea used to labor  may   th  we left  memikan  and went up to the tops of the snowy mountains of gawar  the  cold was such that we were obliged to wrap our faces and our hands as  we would in january  as we descended the mountain  we found it about as  warm as february  that night we staid in the deep valley of ishtazin   in the village of boobawa  where yohanan and guly dwell  the people  here are very wild and hard  yohanan and guly were not here  having  gone to visit khananis  only a few came together for preaching  the  people said   yohanan preaches  and we revile   may   th  we left  boobawa  and soon crossed the river  men had gone before us  and were  lying in wait there  they stripped us  but afterwards  of themselves   became sorry  and returned our things  as we were going along this  wonderful  fearful river  and beheld the mountains on either side  covered with beautiful forests  we remembered mr  rhea  the composer of  the hymn   valley of ishtazin   and when filled with wonder at the  works of the great creator  we all  with one voice  praised him in  songs of joy fitting for the mountains  here the brethren reminded me  that our dear miss fiske had trodden these fearful precipices  this  greatly encouraged me in my journey  this day we went into many  villages  and over many ascents and descents  at evening we reached  jeloo  and remained over night in the pleasant village of zeer  which  lies in a valley made beautiful by forests  and a river passing through  it  they showed great hospitality here  and were eager to receive the  word of the lord  may   th  we left zeer  and went to bass  it was  saturday night  and we remained over the sabbath in the village of  nerik  i shall always have a pleasant remembrance of the sabbath we  passed there  prom the first moment that we went in till monday  morning  we were never alone  so many were assembling to hear the words  of the lord  with tearful eyes and burning hearts  they were inquiring  for the way of salvation  they would say   what shall we do  we have no  one to sit among us  to teach us  poor  wretched ones   truly  a man s  heart burns within him as he sees this poor people scattered as sheep  without a shepherd  may   th  we mounted our mules  and went on our  way  half an hour from nerik we came to the village of urwintoos  an  honorable  kind hearted woman came out  and made us her guests  this  was oshana s aunt  as soon as we sat down  the house was filled with  men and women  they brought a testament themselves  and entreated us to  read from that holy book  did not my heart rejoice when i saw how  eagerly they were listening to the account of the death of our lord  jesns christ  when the men went out  the women came very near to me   entreating for the word of the lord  as those thirsting for water  then  i read to them from the book      there are many sad deeds of wickedness among these mountain  nestorians  and when christians hear how anxious they are to receive  the words of life  will they not feel for them  we reached tehoma may    th  now  from the mercy of god  we are all well and in the village of  mazrayee  i am not able to labor for the women here  as i desired   because many of them have gone to the sheep folds  it is so hot we  cannot remain here  and we will go there also  soon  i trust  wherever  i am  and as long as i am here  i shall labor for that master who  wearied himself for me  and who bought these souls with his blood      the lord keep and bless you  our beloved  who have been a mother to  the nestorian girls  all of whom  with longing hearts are expecting  your return  we continually pray him who gave you to us  to restore you  again in mercy to our people  if counted worthy  i should greatly  rejoice to receive a little note from you      she returned to oroomiah in the spring of       and left again in       for amadia  when she went away  her three children had the whooping  cough  so she would not go into any of the mission families lest she  should spread the disease among the children  but after she was all  ready to go  and the heads of her own little flock were peeping out of  the saddle bag contrivance in which they rode  mrs  breath went out to  bid her good by  sarah told her how miss fiske had said  when she took  her oldest child into her arms for the first time    now  sarah  you  will not seek for this child a pleasant home upon the plain  as lot  did  but rather to do god s will  and then he will give you all  things    i have always remembered it   she added   and am not willing  now to be found seeking my pleasure here      during the long winter of          no messenger could cross the  mountains from oroomiah to amadia  and she thus writes in march         to miss rice        i did greatly long for the coming of the messenger  we were very sad  in not hearing a single word from home  now i offer thanksgivings to  him in whose hands are all things  that he has opened a door of mercy   and has delighted us by the arrival of letters  they came to day  many  thanks to you and your dear pupils  the lord bless them  and prepare  their hearts for such a blessed work as ours      give eneya s salutations and mine to all the school  i think they will  wish to hear about the work of the lord here  thanks to god  our health  has been good ever since we came  and our hearts have been contented  and happy in seeing some of our neighbors believing  and with joy  receiving the words of life  every sabbath we have a congregation of  thirty five  and more men than women  for many weeks only the men came   but now  by the grace of god  the women come too  and their number is  increasing  i have commenced to teach them the life of the lord jesus  from the beginning  i have strong hopes that god is awakening one of  them  his word is very dear to her  her son is the priest of the  village  and a sincere christian  four other young men and five women  are  we trust  not far from the door of the kingdom  we entreat you   dear sisters  to pray in a special manner for these thoughtful ones   that they may enter the narrow door of life      from the villages about us we have a good report  they receive the  gospel from oshana and shlemon  who visit them every sabbath  in my  journeys through these mountains  i have seen various assemblies of men  and women listening to the gospel  poor ones  exclaiming  what shall we  do  our priests have deceived us  we are lost  like sheep on the  mountains  there is no one to teach us   they sit in misery and  ignorance  they need our prayers and our help  i verily believe that if  we labor faithfully  god help us to labor thus  we shall soon see our  church revived  built up on the foundation christ jesus  and adorned  for him as a bride for her husband  with tears of joy we shall gaze on  these ancient ruins becoming new temples of the lord  soon shall these  mountains witness scenes that will rejoice angels and saints  those  will be blessed times  let us pray for them  and labor with christ for  their coming      our latest news from sarah is  that during the summer of       her  little son had died  and she herself was just recovering from a  dangerous fever     the joyful anticipations awakened by such a letter from a graduate of  the seminary  in ancient amadia  are not diminished by accounts  received of a conference of  mountain helpers   held in gawar  from may    th to june  d        they came from gawar  jeloo  tehoma and amadia   at the opening of each session  half an hour was spent in prayer  then  carefully prepared essays were read on subjects previously assigned   and each topic was afterwards thoroughly discussed  the first subject  was   hinderances to evangelization in the mountains   such as their  ruggedness  deep snows  superstition of the people  and persecution    deacon tamo  in speaking  admitted all these  but said   for rough  roads we have our feet and goats  hair sandals  for deep snows  snow  shoes  for the darkness and superstition of the people  we have the  light of the truth and the sword of the spirit  and for persecution  we  have god s promise of protection and the firman of the sultan    the  faithful pastor s duty to his flock   and  means of securing laborers  for the field   were among the topics discussed  their discussions on  the subject of benevolence showed that they regarded that duty as  binding as any other  they engaged to observe the monthly concert  and  take up monthly and also annual collections in their congregations  and  apply the proceeds to the support of a laborer in the mountains  on  sabbath evening the monthly concert was observed  and after stirring  addresses  the contribution amounted to what was for them the very  large sum of fifty two dollars  among the offerings were a horse  an  ox  a sheep  a goat  and different articles of jewelry  arrangements  were made at the conference for the formation of a protestant community  in gawar  in accordance with the firman of the sultan  in all respects  the meeting was a rich spiritual festival  and from the spirit its  members manifested  and the progress already made  we may hope for  extensive and important results before many years have passed away           chapter xix       ebenezers     examination in        collation and address   valedictory by sanum     sabbath school in geog tapa   examination there in        prayer  meeting and communion at oroomiah  may         selby  of gavalan  and  letter   letter from hatoon  of geog tapa     there are occasions  interesting in themselves  that also serve to mark  the progress which they promote  such an occasion was the examination  of the seminary  june  th        there have been examinations since   but none so marked in their influence for good  none where the teachers  felt so much like calling the name of it  ebenezer   and saying    hitherto hath the lord helped us      the pupils had improved  during the last weeks of the term  more than  they had ever done in twice the same length of time  both spiritually  and mentally  at the close of the term  their parents and friends  with  some of the leading nestorians  were invited to the examination  more  than one hundred and sixty spectators  besides the pupils  were crowded  into the large recitation room  this had been adorned with a profusion  of roses  from the vineyard of mar yohanan  arranged in wreaths and  bouquets  with festoons of sycamore leaves  and other devices  the  people were delighted   for  like other persians  they are great  admirers of flowers   and many  on entering  involuntarily exclaimed    paradise  paradise   in their various studies  the attainments of the  pupils would have reflected honor on a seminary in our own land  but  their knowledge of scripture exceeded all besides  even on the details  of the tabernacle they rarely faltered  and their compositions showed  an intimate acquaintance with bible facts and doctrines     dr  perkins delivered an address  comparing the early days of the  mission with that scene  and felicitously answering various objections  that had been raised against female education  and  at the close   diplomas were given to three of the oldest pupils     the exercises were pleasantly diversified by a plentiful collation  under the arbor in the court behind the seminary  where lambs roasted  whole  in the native style  lettuce  cherries  pilav  a preparation of  rice   and some cake  prepared by the pupils  were duly discussed  many  of the women had never before sat at the same table with men  and it  was amusing to witness their awkward embarrassment  some snatched the  food from the table by stealth  and ate it behind their large veils  as  though it were a thing forbidden     hormezd  the miner of john  now aged and blind  who had been led all  the way from geog tapa  said  towards the close of the afternoon   i  wish joshua were here       and what do you  want of joshua       i want him to command the sun and moon to stand still  for the day is  altogether too short   as the company dispersed  several old men took  miss fiske and miss rice by the hand  saying  with moistened eyes    will you forgive us that we have done no more for your school   but  the best of all was  some sixty adult women  from different villages   begging for spelling books  that they might commence learning to read   thirty of them did not rest till they could read their bibles  the  cause of female education never lost the impulse that it received that  day     instead of the valedictory composed for this anniversary  is here  subjoined the greater part of the one prepared by sanum  for a like  occasion  because it takes a wider range  and is richer in its  historical allusions        now that another year is closed  and we are ready to leave each other  in peace  it is fitting to review the past  that together we may praise  the sweet keeper of israel for the blessings he has poured upon our  heads  we fear to try to recount them all  lest we tempt the lord  so  we will speak of but a few      let us renew the wings of our loving thoughts  send them to the years  that are past  and see where rests the dust of some of the dear  teachers of this school  listen  there comes a voice   they are not to  be found among the living   yes  the place of one is empty here  and of  another there  then  where are they  thou  o country art a witness that  they have pressed thy soil  and you  ye blessed winds  answer us   they  have gone   and ye green leaves of time are true witnesses that they  lie among the numbered dead  but where shall we find them  they lie far  apart  we must visit one that first laid her hand on some of us to  bless us  mrs  grant   and though we remember her not  she often  embraced us in the arms of love  and carried us before a throne of  grace  she was one of the first that left all her friends  and ploughed  the mighty waves of ocean  that she might come to oroomiah s dark  border  though fierce tempests raged  and heavy waves raised themselves  above the ship  her prayers  mingled with love for us  ascended higher  still  and overcame all  at the foot of mount ararat she doubtless  remembered the bow of promise  and her consolations were renewed  when  she thought of it as a prophecy  that a company of the fallen daughters  of chaldea should become heirs of glory  she so labored  that her  influence is widening from generation to generation      the lord is rewarding her even to the third and fourth generation  but  though she engaged in her work with such holy zeal  her journey was  short  some of us had not seen our eighth summer when those lips  on  which were written wisdom  were still  and that tongue  on which dwelt  the law of kindness  was silent in death  now she rests in our  churchyard  she sleeps with our dead  and her dust is mingled with the  dust of our fathers  till that day when she shall rise to glory  and a  company of ransomed nestorians with her      but where is that other dear friend of our school  dr  grant   who was  the beautiful staff of her support  he encouraged her to labor for us  while many of us were yet unborn  his heart was large enough to love  every son and daughter of our people  he sowed with many tears  and  gave himself for the nestorians  shall we not believe that the fruits  of his labors have sprung up among us  then  where is he  let us go  silently  silently  and ask that ancient city  nineveh  it will direct  us   lo  he rests on the banks of the noble tigris   would that our  whisper might reach the ear of the wild arab and cruel turk  that they  walk gently by that stranger grave  and tread not on its dust  then   shall we think no more of it  no  with a firm hope we expect that those  mountains  on which his beautiful feet rested  shall answer his name in  echoes  one to the other  and the persons who saw his faithful example  there shall mingle in the flock of his saviour      but the journey of our thoughts is not finished  we must leave in  peace this blessed grave  and go search for one with whom we were well  acquainted  mrs  stoddard   and whose gentle  loving example is so  graven on the tablet of memory  that it cannot be erased  can we forget  her prayers with some of us the week she left us  or how  when she took  our hand for the last time  she said   the blessing of the lord rest  upon you   we did not then expect that our eyes would no more rest on  that lovely face  and our ears no more hear that sweet voice in our  dwellings  when we heard of her departure to a world of light  it was  hard to believe that she had gone and left us behind  lo  on the shores  of the black sea she has laid her down to rest  o ye angry waves  be  still  and ye winds of god  fan gently that sacred spot  all our people  are indebted to thee  thou blessed one  thou  who didst first teach us  to sing the songs of zion  now removed from sin and sorrow  thou art  singing with the myriads of the just  we would not call thee back  but  rather praise the lord that you and those other dear friends are  entered into rest  no  ye are not lost  ye spirits made holy  but as it  was necessary that some should come from a distant land to labor here   so ye were necessary to do a greater work in heaven  we believe that ye  are doing there more than ye could have done here  yea  that ye form a  part of that great cloud of witnesses that encompass us to day  it is  delightful to us to think that ye blessed ones guard us  it is a  comfort to our teachers to think that you  who laid these foundations   are still round about us  beloved ones  we would not call you back   cling closely  and more closely  to your saviour  till we  too  through  free grace  shall share in your glory      and now  beloved friends  who with them flew on the wings of the  gospel across the ocean to tell us of salvation  we rejoice to day that  the sharp arrows of death have not touched you  ye have been more than  fathers and mothers to us  our hearts are full of love to every one of  you  o blessed band  but we cannot express it  except with a heavenly  tongue  when darkness reigned in the breast of every son of the  chaldeans  and no whisper of salvation had fallen on the ear of their  daughters  you opened the beauties of the priceless pearl before our  eyes  that it should enlighten us with heavenly brightness  we cannot  make known all that you have done for us  let it remain till that day  of light when the lord shall commend you before his chosen  when we  look at our dear teachers  our hearts warm to you with no common love   because you led them to leave the sweet place of their nativity for our  sakes  you have been parents to them  wiping away their tears with the  soft hand of a mother  and sharing their trials with a father s heart   while you have helped them in every department of their school  the  blessing has all been ours      if on the wings of an eagle we should fly to the extreme north  we  should find no such school as this  crowned with blessings  but should  see our sisters groaning in bitterness  saying   not one ray from the  divine sun rises on us in our misery   if we turn to the south  there  we see the daughters of arabia lamenting   in all this desert  not one  oasis yields the waters of life to quench our burning thirst   eternity  alone will suffice to praise him who sent you  the only heralds of his  grace  to us sinners      but our southern journey is not finished  from one end of africa to  the other our sisters lie wrapped in the shadows of death  and if we  turn to the east  all the way to china  the daughters cry   wretched is  our unhappy lot  no cloud of mercy  such as surrounds you  lights up  the place of our abode  so on the west  as far as constantinople  our  companions in suffering have no school to sound in their ears the  blessed name of jesus      what are we  that the lord should choose us from the midst of such  darkness  and send you to us with the message of life  let all nations   with wondering lips  praise the almighty for his grace to us  so  worthless      now that we go from you  we leave with you this our handiwork as a  token of gratitude   a specimen of needlework now among the curiosities  at the missionary house in boston   receive it  though a trifle  the  figures on it show what you have taught us in our pleasant school  as  we have first of all been taught to sit at the foot of the cross  and  neither hope nor glory in anything else  we have made that the  foundation  under the cross you have watered us with the showers of  divine instruction and prayers  that  like this vine  we might entwine  about it and bear pleasant fruit  from this cross we learned  while yet  in the bloom of life  like newly opened flowers  to join together in  sweet friendship  above this we have placed a circle around the holy  bible  that bright lamp of the lord  that will enlighten us like the  sun if we follow its leading  that well of living waters  which will  cause us to flourish like the palm tree  thus will our leaf be ever  green  and our fruit sweet till the day when the mystery of love shall  be revealed  and we dwell in the mansions of the blest  there  joining  with all the singers in heavenly places  we shall receive harps and  sing glory to our heavenly king  who saved us from everlasting woe   there we shall inherit crowns of gold  and  with myriads of the saints   cast them down before the lamb  if but one of us reach that place  will  you deem your labor in vain  god  who rewards even the gift of a cup of  cold water  will never forget what you have done to the least of his  people  and if the least are on the earth  we are they  now that you  send us forth into the world  remember us  we beg you  whenever you  bring your sacrifice before the lord      dear teachers  your acts of kindness have been more than the hairs of  our heads  we cannot recount them  we can only ask him  who alone is  rich  to reward you from his good treasures  for none but he can meet  our obligations to you  each thought that reverts to the past demands a  tear of gratitude  o blessed seasons  when god sent down his holy  spirit  that through your labors these walls of jerusalem  so long  broken down  might be again rebuilt  it is sweet to think that in the  hand of christ  you have been the means of the salvation of our souls   which are to live forever  we believe that your prayers and tears are  in the golden censer before the throne  now that we go out from under  your wings of love  which cannot reach to all your scattered flock  we  entreat you to ask the good shepherd to lead us in green pastures and  beside the still waters  and keep us under his wings of mercy in our  weakness      her address to the native teachers  bishops   c   is omitted       dear parents  we rejoice exceedingly to see you here  looking on us  with eyes of love  no words can express what you have done for us   especially in sending us here to learn of jesus  we trust that it has  been  or shall be  a blessing to you also  it is our hope that you will  be willing to send your daughters to distant places  to make known  eternal life  if you do  great will be your reward from the lord      and now  sweet sisters  another year have we sat under our own vine  and fig tree unmolested  we have tasted the honey and milk of the  blessed land  and drank of the waters from the rock  but now the time  has come to leave these bowers of knowledge  but not the lessons here  learned  nor the counsels of our teachers  nor the sweet whispers of  the holy spirit      dear sisters  let us bear forth with us the light giving countenance  of the saviour  which will scatter all the evil around us as the light  dispels the darkness  without this we cannot go  though separated in  body  let us be united in fervent prayer  let a conscience made  sensitive by grace be our abiding companion  let the tent of abraham  teach us that we have no abiding city here  and like him  let our first  work be to offer those prayers to god which shall testify that he is  ours  and now  before going forth  let us clothe ourselves with the  meekness and gentleness of christ  yea  let us take with us all his  virtues  being obedient  teaching our dying associates  and leading  them one and all to christ  though we part  our love can never be  sundered  and we will ask the lord to send his ministering spirits to  strengthen our faltering steps  and feed our souls with heavenly manna   so that if we never more see each other here  we may meet in heaven  with our sisters who have gone before      the teachers improved the interest awakened by the examination in        to urge their older pupils to labor in the village sabbath schools  and  let us look in on their efforts in geog tapa  the children there were  divided into ten classes  each with one of the pupils for a teacher   others taught the women who could not read  soon these were joined by  both old and young men  who were taught by pupils from the seminary at  seir  and as many as forty spelling books were in active use  the  children  too  were taught to sing  thus they labored till winter  when  the school was put in charge of the village school teachers  in the  spring the pupils resumed the work with undiminished zeal  nor did they  toil in vain  for the attendance increased from about seventy to four  hundred  and some of the teachers testified that they spent there some  of the most delightful sabbaths they ever knew  yonan  who  superintended the school with moses  had also a class of old women   that increased from six to thirty seven  whom he taught from the book   well known to our sabbath school children   line upon line   his own  account of it is very interesting  he says   the women  especially the  aged among them  have a habit  when they meet  of engaging in  unprofitable conversation  and  both on the way to church and in it  we  could not stop it  awakening sermons produced no impression  and though  they had heard preaching for fifteen years  they were still very  ignorant  but now what i teach them on one sabbath i require them to  repeat the next  and so they are obliged to leave off their gossip  and  talk over what they have heard  that they may not forget it  these  women are so anxious to be taught  that if i am hindered a little  longer than usual in arranging the classes  they cry out after me in  the church  that all the other classes are being taught  but they  forsaken      a class of old men  taught by deacon john  commenced with an attendance  of ten  but soon numbered forty  formerly they went to market on the  sabbath  or sat sunning themselves in the street  going to hear  preaching about half the time  but they became so interested in the  exercises  that they were unwilling they should close  they brought  others with them  and if one of them was kept away one sabbath  he  mourned that the rest had got so far before him     the women carried their books with them when they went out to the  vineyards  and at resting time  while others slept  they read  some   who could not afford oil at night  read by moonlight  and when they  spun  they fastened the book open on a shelf  so that they could read  at the same time  once  when a woman was asked if she could repeat her  lesson  she replied   o  yes  i repeated it over just now while i was  milking   the men also took their books out to the fields  that they  might improve every spare moment  and one was so earnest that  when  waked in the night to attend to the cattle  he read till morning  but  his family  finding that he burned so much oil  took care after that to  let him sleep  good old mar elias rejoiced to see such a work among his  flock  and it was most pleasant to see the large church so crowded by  people  seated on the floor  that one could hardly walk about among  them     after the teachers had attended to their classes about an hour and a  half  the younger scholars repeated the portion of scripture they had  learned during the week  and the parents were much pleased to hear  their children recite     the daily report of the seminary was introduced into the sabbath school  in a way that only orientals could do it  the older members of the  school were required to report any cases of swearing  stealing  or  quarrelling among the younger ones during the week  who were publicly  reproved on the following sabbath  this made the parents more careful  to watch over their children  and the children more circumspect in  their daily behavior  if any little trouble occurred among them during  the week  they said to each other   let us be careful  sabbath is  near   and though at first some of the people smiled when the children  were reproved  it soon became more common for them to weep     after taking an account of the attendance  the children sung  divided  into two companies  on opposite sides of the church  and then mar  ellas  or some of the elders of the village  addressed the school   yonan closes his account of it by saying   we have learned in this work  more than ever before the value of female education  among our most  energetic  faithful teachers are young women who love to sit down  before little children  and the ignorant of their own sex  and teach  them the way of life      thursday  june  st        was a great day in geog tapa  the forenoon  was devoted to the examination of a girls  school  taught by hanee and  nargis  graduates of the preceding year  and both belonging in the  village  as it was a feast day  a large number were present from the  neighboring hamlets  at nine o clock the examination commenced in the  spacious church  which was crowded  the congregation numbering about  six hundred in all  the fifty pupils occupied the middle of the church   the studies pursued were ancient and modern syriac  geography   arithmetic  both scripture and secular history  reading and spelling   and in all of them the pupils did credit both to themselves and their  teachers  the singing  that day  especially pleased the parents  many  of whom exclaimed with wonder   our daughters can learn as well as our  sons   miss fiske rejoiced to see her children s children in the pupils  of her first pupil  who gracefully managed her little flock with an  easy control  the villages of gavalan  vizierawa  and ardishai  had  each a similar school  containing in all one hundred pupils  and each  of these schools was as valued a centre of religious influence as of  intellectual training  the teachers were in the habit of praying with  one of their pupils alone every day  as well as of opening the school  with prayer  and friday afternoon was regularly devoted to a religious  meeting with the mothers of the pupils  these schools fitted the  teachers for usefulness  and the pupils for admission to the seminary   as well as for teachers in the sabbath school  and they furnish a  delightful view of the present and prospective usefulness of the  seminary among the people     noon came  and the large assembly scattered  to enjoy the hospitality  of the village  for the people opened their houses for those in  attendance  just as they do with us at the annual meetings of the  american board  geog tapa could also boast of its committee of  arrangements  in humble imitation of greater things     after a recess of an hour and a half  the people reassembled for the  examination of the sabbath school  in a grove behind the church  as  that building could not contain the multitude which now numbered more  than a thousand  first came a class of men  from twenty to seventy  years of age  headed by malik aga bey  the village chief  they had been  taught orally by deacon john  and answered questions in old testament  history very readily  then followed a class of women  fifty or sixty in  number  most of them over forty years of age  these had been taught by  yonan  and were quite familiar with the old testament  from the  creation to the reign of david  one old blind woman wanted to point out  the stopping places of israel in the desert  on the map which hung on  one of the tall trees  she had learned their names by heart  and was  familiar with their location by touch     next came a class of twenty men  who had recently learned to read  for  which they had each received a copy of the new testament  a class of  women then followed  numbering twenty three  who had also been taught  to read by the boys and girls in the village schools  mr  stoddard  called for the teacher of each woman to step forward  and a copy of the  old testament was presented to every one of them  as they stood in a  row in front of their pupils  there was one woman who stood without a  teacher  mr  stoddard called for hers also  and some one whispered to  him that she had been taught by her husband  mr  stoddard thereupon led  him out  and  placing his hand on his head  said  before the whole  assembly   all honor to the man who has taught his wife to read   and  presented him also with a bible     one who was frequently present often wept to see women giving a morsel  to their infants to quiet them  that they might devote the longer time  to their lessons  some of them so intent on the work of learning  that  their faces were bathed in perspiration  she used to fill her pocket  and reticule with cakes for the little ones  so that their mothers  might be more free from interruption  the exercises of that day gave a  great impulse to the cause of education in geog tapa  as many as  seventy adults were soon poring over their spelling books  and the next  summer one half of the adult women were either readers or engaged in  the same employment  though previous to the examination of the seminary  in       not one in thirty could read  or cared to learn     having given an account of these two interesting occasions  let us now  look in on another equally interesting  though of a different kind   that took place in oroomiah  three years later  during the interval   mr  stoddard had entered into rest  and his bereaved widow  dr  perkins  and family  and miss fiske  were about to sit down together  perhaps  for the last time  with the nestorian converts  at the table of the  lord     it was in may  and the day one of the finest of those charming may days  in oroomiah  the most of the nestorians who had been admitted to the  communion were present  and in distributing the guests among the  mission families  it was understood that all who had been connected  with the seminary should go there  the object of this was  to gather  all the scattered members of the family together once more in the place  where prayer had been wont to be made  before they went to the lord s  table  as yet  no one knew that their teacher was about to leave them   for she did not wish any thing else to turn away their thoughts from  jesus  when they had assembled in the school room  she could not say  much  but besought the lord jesus to be the master of the assembly   after singing a hymn  the words  looking unto jesus  were given as the  key note of the meeting  he came and whispered peace  and all felt that  they sat together in heavenly places  the eyes of their hearts were  opened  so that they realized the fulfilment of the promise   there am  i in the midst of you      they were invited to speak freely of their joys and sorrows  in order  that together they might carry them to jesus  the first to speak was  hanee  one of the two whom mar yohanan brought to miss fiske at the  commencement of the school     she had  not long before  buried her  only child  and holding her hands as though the little one still rested  on her arms  she said   sisters  at the last communion you saw me here  with my babe in these arms  it is not here now  i have laid it into the  arms of jesus  and come to day to tell you there is a sweet as well as  a bitter in affliction  when the rod is appointed to us  let us not  only kiss it  but press it to our lips  when i stood by that little  open grave  i said   all the time i have given to my babe  i will give  to souls   i try to do so  pray for me   she told but the simple truth   for after the death of her child  she used to bring the women into the  room where it died  and there talk and pray with them  since then  she  has received another little one  and in the same spirit given it back  to christ  when she ceased  the whole company were in tears  the leader  could only ask   who will pray   and sanum  whose children had died by  poison  and who could enter into the feelings of the bereaved mother   knelt down and prayed as very few could pray for mothers left desolate   and for those who still folded their little ones in their arms  there  was perfect silence while she pleaded for them  save as the sweet voice  of her own babe sometimes added to the tenderness of her petitions  a  child in heaven  what a treasure  and what a blessing  if it draw the  heart thither also   footnote    see page         there was a little pause after the prayer  and  to the surprise of all   the voice of nazloo was heard in another part of the room  for they had  supposed her near  if not already entering  the river of death    sisters   said she   since seeing you  i have stood with one foot in  the grave  and may i tell you that it is a very different thing to be a  christian then  from what it is in this pleasant school room  let me  ask you if you are sure that you are on the rock christ jesus   a  tender prayer followed  the burden of which was   search us  o lord   and try us  and see if there be any wicked way in us  and lead us in  the way everlasting      the next to speak was one of the early pupils  who had come many miles  that day to be present  she said   i could think but one thought all  the way as i came  and that was   freely ye have received  freely  give   we have certainly received freely  have we given any thing  can  we not do something for souls  i fear the lord jesus is not pleased  with us      they were then asked if they were ready to engage in direct labors for  souls  to search them out  and by conversation and prayer seek to lead  them to christ  many pledged themselves to the work  and engaged to  bring the names of those for whom  they had labored to the next  communion  that all together might intercede in their behalf to god   before that time arrived  miss fiske left for america  but the first  letter she opened  out of a large parcel that awaited her in boston   was one containing the names of those with whom her pupils had labored  and prayed in distant persia  is it strange that  as the slips of paper  fell at her feet  her heart was moved     but we cannot dwell longer on the prayer meeting  as many as twelve  said a few words  and more than that number led in prayer  during the  two hours they were together  from thence all repaired to the dining  room   the three upper windows on the right of the engraving belong to  this   where they did  eat their meat with gladness and singleness of  heart   then it was announced that arrangements had been made for class  prayer meetings  it seemed to be just the thing that all longed for   though none had spoken of it  and at once each class went along the  familiar passages to the room assigned it  and the voice of prayer  arose from nearly every apartment in the building  the chapel bell  rung  but it was unnoticed  and each little company had to be  separately summoned to church  there  according to previous  arrangement  miss fiske led each to a seat  that the communicants might  be together  and then herself sat down behind them all  a glance  revealed ninety three sisters in christ before her  and as the services  had not yet commenced  her thoughts went back to the day when  asking  concerning many of them   is this one a christian    or that one    or  that other   the answer came   you have no sister in christ among them  all   no wonder she now inwardly exclaimed   what hath god wrought  the  lord hath done great things for us  whereof we are glad   there was but  one among the ninety three with whom she had not bowed the knee in  prayer  and that same evening  as she was devising methods to get her  away from the rest to her room alone  the lord sent her  unexpectedly   to the door  and with her also she enjoyed the privilege of personal  religious intercourse and prayer     at the communion  when all stood up to enter into covenant with  thirty nine new converts  six of them pupils of the seminary  there  seemed a deeper meaning than ever before in engaging to be the lord s  forever     in hanee we have seen the grace bestowed on one of the two whom mar  yohanan brought to form the nucleus of the school  the other was selby   of gavalan  his own niece  she became hopefully pious in       when  hardly ten years of age  there were very few in whom her teachers took  such uniform delight  though they felt some anxiety when she married  priest kamo  of marbeeshoo  a cousin of mar shirnon  intelligent and  influential  but unconverted  yet she had strong faith that he would  become a christian  and soon gained a wonderful influence over him   without compromising in the least her own religious principles  she  became his teacher in the bible   it was a new book to him   and in her  he saw the christian life it described beautifully exemplified  she had  just begun to hope that her prayers were answered in his conversion  he  was much interested in aiding the evangelists in the mountains  and the  mission was hoping great things from him  under the good influence of  selby  when he died  her feelings  under this affliction  are thus  described by her own pen  in a letter to her teacher  dated marbeeshoo   june  th              it is not because i have forgotten you that i have not written you  until now  how can i forget you  and were that possible  i could not  forget your instructions  i remember them at all times  by day and by  night  they comfort me in sorrow  and strengthen me in anguish  you  have taught me the duties of this life  and you have pointed me to the  world to come  i remember when you used to take me by the hand  and  lead me into your closet  and there pray with me  and my heart fills  with mingled joy and sorrow  with joy  that such precious seasons were  given me  with sorrow  that they will be mine no more  shall i never  see your face again  that face  which bore to us more than a mother s  love  you were a perfect mother  because in christ      i grieve very much that i did not see you before you left  but i  believe that the seed you have sown will continue to spring up to the  end of the world  you asked me  in your letter  to tell you about my  work  i have a greater work than any of my companions  but it is in a  place covered with thick darkness  like that of egypt  the people are  stiff necked  wise to do evil  but of god they have no knowledge   temptations surround me as mountains  they rise up about me like the  waves of the sea  while kamo lived  i was comforted  for he loved the  truth  every day he used to read the scriptures with me  and ask the  meaning of each verse  i had hoped he would have paul s zeal in the  work of the lord  i had expected that we should have schools in our  village after a year or two  and that the places of concourse for idle  conversation would become places for reading the scriptures  and for  prayer  but it has pleased the lord to give me a great and heavy  affliction  he has smitten me with his own rod  making this world a  vale of tears  but it is the lord  let him do what he pleaseth  it is  all for my profit      i want to ask you and your friends to pray for me  that i may endure  to the end      the feelings of the pupils  after the departure of miss fiske  are  graphically expressed in the following letter from hatoon  of geog  tapa        my heart longs to tell you of the change in our dear school  our  return  after vacation  was much like that of the jews from babylon   when they found their city laid waste  and their temple in ruins  every  time they looked on the spot where it had stood  their hearts were  crushed  so when we did not see you  and went not to take your hand and  be kissed by you   when we saw not your ready feet coming to the door   to bring in each one and make her happy   our hearts were broken  and  we could not restrain our tears  especially when i remembered the times  that the daughters of the church used to meet in your room to mingle  our prayers  our tears  and our joys together  these recollections  leave an aching void which cannot be filled  it seems to me that the  ways of your room mourn  because you come not to the solemn feasts  if  jeremiah were here  i think he would say   how doth miss fiske s room  sit solitary that was full of people  how do the daughters of the  oroomiah schools mourn  and their eyes run down with water  because  miss fiske is far from them   these changes show us that this world is  as down driven by the wind  perhaps you will reply  in your cheerful  way   do you feel so  there is much that is pleasant in the world   i  know it  but our school was always such a pleasant place to me  i was  so happy in it and its heavenly employments  that not even the death of  friends could destroy that joy  but now i seem overshadowed by dark  clouds  and sinking in deep mire  yet i will try  in all this  to bow  my will to the holy will of him who doeth all things well            chapter xx       compositions     the field of cloves   the lost soul   the saved soul   hannah     it was very important that the pupils should be able to express their  own thoughts  readily and correctly  with the pen  and unwearied effort  was devoted to this end  but for a long time they seemed incapable of  clothing an idea in words  the simplest sentence was copied over and  over without the change of a single word  and even when it was  expressed for them in other language  they only repeated over that  variation of the first  three years were spent in trying to teach them  to write their own thoughts  with very little success  but in       the  spirit of god secured the result that man had sought in vain  after  that  both their ideas and their language were very beautiful  nothing  pleased them better than to be allowed to write  and it was matter of  grateful remark that those compositions which were penned during a  revival were always the best     this was especially true in the awakening of       which was noted for  the prevalence of a spirit of meditation and holy communion with god   the pupils at that time came forth from private intercourse with their  saviour  to pen some of the sweetest writings in the syriac language     one day that winter  both the teachers wished to attend an examination  at seir  and asked them if they would be diligent during their absence    o  yes   was the reply   if you will only let us write composition    the following was found on the slate of nazloo  when they returned        the clover field      we walk out in the country  and the road leads us by a lovely field of  clover  we see it in all its modest beauty  there are the green leaves   so regular in their form and outline  the beautiful flowers  so  wonderful in their structure  and the sweet fragrance  that regales our  senses as we pass  all these are there  but we see not whence they  come  no showers descend to make it grow  the earth is parched on all  sides  do you inquire for the source of all this loveliness  a tiny  rill of water flows gently underneath  no eye sees it  you cannot hear  its quiet advance  for it does not murmur as it wears itself out in its  work of love  noiseless it hies to each little rootlet  it conveys  nourishment to every leaf  not one is overlooked or forgotten  that  unseen rill causes these fair blossoms to spring forth  it distils  these odors for the enjoyment of all that pass this way  what that  streamlet is to the field  prayer is to the christian  we see it not   it is all hid from human eye  but o  the rich fruit that it yields  every day in the soul thus made partaker of the life of christ  that  also makes the wilderness to rejoice and blossom as the rose      at the annual examination in       sanum read her composition  a  translation of which is here inserted        the lost soul      i have dreamed a dream  dear friends  may i relate it      in my dream i was wandering about  seeking for earthly pleasures   though my life was crowned with blessings more plentiful than the dew  of the morning  my father and mother did every thing they could to  bring me to christ  their labors for me were enough to make me weep my  last tear  but my hard heart remained unmoved  four times did the holy  spirit strive with me  and as often i grieved him away  i broke every  promise that i made to serve the lord      there came a beautiful day in spring  the sun lighted up every thing  with gladness  the fields were dressed in green  the trees were in  blossom  loved by my friends  surrounded by every thing to make me  happy  and rejoicing that so much enjoyment was still in store for me   i was saying to my soul   take thine ease   when suddenly a voice  cried   this night thy soul shall be required of thee  then whose shall  be all these   another voice added   these four years heaven and earth  have pleaded with you to bring forth fruit to god  but you have  refused  your heart has said  i will fix my seat above the stars of  heaven   now you must go down to the abyss   like arrows these words  pierced my heart  my strength departed  and others bore me to my home   there my parents were speechless with sorrow  the bed of down was made  ready  but it afforded me no rest  i seemed to lie on thorns  then i  appeared to faint  though still able to hear their conversation   sobbing aloud  they said   sweet child  if you were only a christian   gladly would we go with you to the gates of heaven  hoping soon to meet  again  but this is more than we can bear  alas  that one borne in the  arms of our love  with whom and for whom we have prayed  must now say  that our god is not her god  nor our saviour hers  is there no ray of  light for her in the darkness  can we never again point her to jesus    as i listened in anguish  i cried aloud   is there no hope for me    they replied   we will implore mercy for you again and again  and  possibly the physician may help you  here he is   as he came in the  recollection of his past faithful warnings made me weep aloud  he said    why weep  do you not wish to see me    dear friend  it is not that   but the sight of you recalls your entreaties to come to christ  and my  neglect of them  if you can only give me one hour of quiet  i will try  to come now   he saw that the hand of death was on me  and replied    what you do you must do quickly    what can i do in such distress     can you not cry   lord  remember me   like the dying malefactor     those words comforted me once  but now i cannot use them    can you  not pray    no  once i would not hear god  and now he will not hear me   o father  mother  friends  pray for me  send for my teacher to pray for  me  ask every servant of god to entreat for me while yet i live   the  request went forth  the weeping physician offered supplication at my  side  my father and mother seemed to pour forth their last breath in  intercession for me  as i turned  i saw my teachers  and conscience  arrayed before me every word they had ever spoken to me of christ and  heaven  all my own actions were likewise spread out before my eyes   then the whirlwind of my sins swept me away like a tiny leaf  to sink  in a sea of anguish  my teacher now cried   we had hoped to see our  dear pupil passing over to the new jerusalem  but  instead of that   must she dwell among the lost   a gentle voice then whispered   go to  jesus  he will not cast you out    to jesus  nay  for knowingly my  hands have pierced him  willingly these feet have trampled on his  precious blood  i have compelled his spirit to forsake me  and must  perish       then i saw those whom i had led into sin and encouraged in unbelief   and said to them   can you forgive me   but a voice from heaven  replied   you cannot be forgiven  for the name of jesus you have set at  nought  and there is none other   then my teacher pressed my hand  she  could not speak  i said   you have ever shown great love  can you not  help me now    dear child  have i not told you that though i love you   yet i have no power to help in this hour or hereafter    o  dreadful  thought  must i leave you all  forever  parents  teachers  all  can you  do nothing for me    we can only point you to jesus    i have no part  in him  i am a demas  and with such agony now  what will be the wrath  to come   i begged all present not to live as i had lived   seize the  moments that fly swifter than the lightning  there is no place for  repentance now  my retribution begins  forget not these words of your  lost sister   i turned to my mother   there is no love like a mother s   can that do nothing for me now   what could she do   can no one help  me  father  father  i am going  can you do nothing       now the light forsook my eyes  o for a few moments more  but even this  was denied me  for  as i remembered   cursed is the man that trusteth  in man  and whose heart departeth from the living god       i now heard a voice as of a rushing  mighty wind  trembling seized me   as i discerned four fiends of darkness  i uttered a piercing shriek   and died  then i found myself suspended between heaven and earth   behind me  the world i loved so well had gone forever  before me i saw  the ancient of days seated on his throne  his raiment white as snow   his eyes as a flame of fire  his feet like brass glowing in the  furnace  and a stream of fire issued from before him  thousand  thousands ministered unto him  and ten thousand times ten thousand  stood before him  brightness radiated from him on all sides  he fixed  his eyes on me  glowing with holy indignation  while a two edged sword  proceeded out of his mouth  my sins arose before me  conscience  condemned me  i could not look up  the pains of hell gat hold upon me   in a voice unlike all i ever heard before  he said   slayer of my son   despiser of my grace  what hast thou done  thou hast set at nought all  my counsels   i longed to flee  but above me stood the judge  below   the abyss  i could give no reply  again he said   my covenant thou hast  trodden under foot   and he commanded his servants   bind her hand and  foot  and cast her into outer darkness  where is weeping and gnashing  of teeth  there let her remain till that great day  when all mine  enemies shall be trodden in the wine press of my wrath       then a voice from out of the throne said   praise our god  all ye his  servants  and ye that fear him  both small and great   and all cried   like the voice of many waters   amen  allelujah   heaven responded from  all sides   just and true are thy judgments  thou king of saints   then  satan and his angels clapped their hands  and mocking my misery  they  thrust me into the inner prison      i now found myself associated with cain  judas  jeroboam  and jezebel   i understood what christ meant when he said   bind the tares in bundles  to burn them   for i was enclosed by them on all sides  and the flames  from them kindled on me  then a voice said   judas sold his lord once   but thou many times  cain slew one brother  thou hast brought many to  this place of torment   then all  especially those whom i had led  there  cursed me  fallen spirits gloried over me  the evil passions of  all the lost were let loose on me  my own wicked feelings were kindled  into a flame by the divine wrath  now i understood that scripture    they have no rest day nor night   my ears  that had taken pleasure in  evil conversation  were filled with revilings  my tongue  which had set  on fire the course of nature  now itself set on fire of hell  i gnawed  for pain  i looked up to beg a drop of water  but instead of it came  the word   daughter  remember   as i looked up  i got a glimpse of one  of my companions in abraham s bosom  once we were together pointed to  jesus  now the impassable gulf was between us  hope now fled forever   and that word   remember   brought every moment of my life before me in  characters of flaming fire  gladly would i have exchanged this agony  for the pangs of death endured a thousand times over  or for all the  sufferings of earth till the final conflagration  i cursed my soul   weeping without a tear  why were my associates  once  like me  children  of wrath  now in heaven  while i was shut out  ah  they listened to  jesus  while i rejected him  and to enjoy a momentary pleasure plunged  into all this anguish  i had loved those who now tormented me  and cast  aside the loving saviour  no ray of mercy can ever reach me more  no  friend will ever love me again  in my madness i sought to flee  but  wrath held me rooted to the spot  cloud on cloud rose above me  each  inscribed   eternity   a voice cried aloud   forever   and another  replied   forever and ever   the waves of fire now rolled over me  and  the worm that dieth not seized hold of me  i begged for even the  smallest mitigation of misery  and the vials of wrath were poured out  upon me  in my anguish i cried   roll on  ye eternal ages   but why   they will be no nearer through   o lord  how long   with an earthquake   that seemed to shake the very throne  came back the reply   forever   forever   i sank down in unutterable agony  then i awoke  and lo  it  was all a dream  the darkness of night was yet around me  a cold sweat  covered me  and that word   forever   still rang in my ears  friends   this was a dream  and only a drop in the ocean  compared with the  terrible reality  let us pray that we may be saved from it through  jesus christ our lord      the large audience listened to these vivid delineations  part of the  time  in breathless silence  and again the women beat on their breasts  with half suppressed cries for mercy  the reader  as well as they  will  find relief from the companion picture by moressa  sanum s was an  original conception of her own  the theme of this last was suggested by  miss fiske  as a fitting counterpart to the preceding  but the  treatment of it was left wholly with the writer      the saved soul      while meditating on death  i fell into a sweet sleep  and dreamed a  dream which rejoiced my spirit  i cannot refrain from relating it to  you  dear christian friends  who are looking forward to the glory that  shall be revealed  i dreamed that my heavenly father said to me   dear  child  heir of my kingdom  you have long enough borne the troubles of  this vale of tears  now you shall be freed from them  and come to your  heavenly home  to worship me in holiness   as i listened  sickness  came  and i laid me down on my bed of death with this thought   one  more fruit of sin  and then  heaven   my poor friends  not  understanding this  inquired  with weeping  if i could not possibly  recover  but when they saw that i was dying  they gathered round me  to  go down with me to the banks of jordan  my soul was exceeding joyful   for the light of the promised land shone on me  and the dread river was  quiet  for jesus had said to it   peace  be still       while in this joyful state  i remembered with sorrow how many years i  had refused to acknowledge the prince of life as my king  while he  waited with open arms to receive me  and how often  after putting my  hand to the plough  i had looked back  my backsliding  my evil example   my neglect of souls  all rose before me like a dark cloud  and i was in  agony  but soon a voice said   thy sins are forgiven   and all was  light  i said   lord  i must praise thee for this forever  but i cannot  forgive myself   yet  though the pains of death were on me  i was  comforted to be nearer the land where they sin no more  earthly  pleasure now seemed emptiness  the pleasures of heaven filled my  thoughts  i said   is this death  that which we poor mortals fear   my  friends asked   has he no terrors for you    no  none  the king of  terrors is to me the chief of joys   one of my teachers said   so you  have no fear of him  no sorrow that your body shall lie in the grave     why fear or sorrow  when christ has overcome both death and sin   my  father then asked   do you suffer much     yes  but if i suffered a  thousand times more  what would that be to those bitter hours upon the  cross  this veil must be rent asunder  though by suffering  before i  can see him  whom  even now  i long to behold   my poor mother  interposed   but are you willing to leave us    you are all very dear  to me  but there is only one who is altogether lovely  when shall i see  him as he is  and be filled with his love       it was now difficult to speak  but i could bid my friends farewell  i  could thank my dear teachers for telling me of christ  and ask their  forgiveness for all i had ever done to grieve them  as my weeping  mother wiped the cold sweat from my brow  she gently whispered   where  is my child going    mother   i replied   your poor sinful child is  going to that saviour who has been willing to receive her   his rod and  staff then comforted me  till i had passed quite over into the blessed  land  and  as i was borne on in my saviour s arms  voices cried    welcome  dear sister  you are now made whole  you shall sin no  more  enter into rest   mortal tongue cannot tell what i now saw of the  treasures which christ has prepared for the redeemed  he gave me a  mansion he had made ready for me  and i found myself gazing on the  brightness of the father s glory  what a change had come over me  i was  among those without spot  for they had been made white in the blood of  the lamb  their voices were one  for all praised the lord  now the  glory of the ancient of days filled me with awe  he sat upon a throne  of light  with seraphim on the right and cherubim on the left  and i  could read the foundations of his throne  legions of bright angels and  happy saints were around him  i fell down with them to worship at his  feet  when he touched me and raised me up  saying   thou art blessed   for thou art redeemed with the blood of my son   then he clothed me in  a heavenly robe  and bade all heaven rejoice  saying   this my child  was dead  and is alive again  and is saved from everlasting  destruction       he then revealed to me more fully that mystery of ages  the redeemer  standing on the right hand of the father  he stood with open arms   saying   come  daughter of my bitter grief  come in peace  i remembered  thee on the cross  for thee i drank that cup of agony  thy curse has  rested on me  that everlasting joy might dwell in thee   as he thus  spoke  i fell down to worship  and when i looked up  my eyes rested on  his pierced hands and wounded side  tears filled my eyes when i  remembered that my sins had caused them  but they were tears that jesus  wiped away      when i saw the book of remembrance at his side  i thought  there is  the record of my sins  but he opened it  saying   fear not  from the  day thou first camest to me  they have been blotted out   he then held  out to me the book of life  bidding me to read my name recorded there   and added   ages hence  in the great day of account  the world shall  know that i have saved thee  and as thou hast not denied me before men   i will confess thy name before my father and before his angels  enter  into the full joy of thy lord  inherit the kingdom  prepared for thee  from the foundation of the world   then all the blessed ones cried    amen   their harps were tuned to a new song  and they praised the  living god that another soul was rescued from the great adversary  a  crown was also placed upon my head  that  with the saints  i might cast  it at the feet of the redeemer      afterwards i was led to our first parent  now for more than five  thousand years in paradise  but not walking amid forbidden fruit   still  when he stretched out his hand to the tree of life  he seemed to  remember that first sin  and to thank god more than others for the  healing of the nations  his bright face glistened with a tear as he  took my hand  saying   heir of my fallen nature  welcome to this  inheritance of the second adam   and i learned that tears are always  wiped from that face when christ brings home his fallen children      as i turned  i saw the great company of the patriarchs  perfect in  holiness  and clothed in light  faithful abraham was there  his faith  changed to perfect sight  and rejoicing in his spiritual children  the  meek moses was there  adoring the prophet whom god raised up from the  midst of israel like unto him  and i beheld isaiah  satisfied with the  eternal sight of the glory of which he had a glimpse on earth   jeremiah  too  was no more weeping for the slain of the daughter of his  people  and all the holy prophets were clothed upon with immortality   and praising their beloved with holy lips      while i stood gazing  on them in wonder  my thoughts reverted to my  former state  what a glorious change  from a world of sin to a world of  holiness  from sinful friends to the friend of sinners  how different  these sweet sounds of praise from the rude sounds of earth  i am  receiving my reward for every bitter tear of penitence i shed on earth   an age of joy is before me  who am i  that i should be raised from  companionship with sin to the society of heaven  my soul at length is  at rest  but how  not as rests my poor body in the grave  but in  blessedness  for i rest from sin  but not from praise  i rest from  suffering  but not from everlasting joy  how sweet to rest  while not  ceasing to cry  holy  holy  holy is the lord god almighty  i rest in  the bosom of my saviour  my prayers are turned to praise  and my love  is perfect      while these thoughts filled my soul  i thanked the lord with a new  song on the golden harp that had been placed in my hands  singing with  a loud voice   what is my worthiness  o eternal king  that thou hast  made me to walk in thy pilgrimage  while millions are shut out from it       now a company of the holy ones led me through a street of pure gold   to where the river of water of life proceeded out of the throne of god   they showed me the hidden manna  and the tree of life yielding its  twelve fruits  and leaves for the healing of the nations  and beyond  i  saw a great company of martyrs who had been slain for the word and for  the testimony of jesus christ  they stood beneath the altar  for they  were living sacrifices  they were clothed in white  and wore crowns of  glory on their heads  and they sang hallelujah to him who had been  slain for them  and made them kings and priests forever in his kingdom      while thus wandering among those holy mansions  i met a spirit crowned  with honor   mary  the mother of our lord  she was specially delighted  at seeing me  saying   how glad i am that you  from that erring people  who trust in me  have found the right way to this blessed place  are  there other sisters of like faith  who believe in the only mediator    when i told her that there were  she embraced me  and led me where i  could see the twelve apostles of the lamb  they were all seated round  their master  just as they used to be on earth  but no more debating  who should be greatest  for now they ascribed all greatness to their  king  and dwelt in perfect love  among them i saw peter  zealous still   but with a holy zeal  i heard him ask   how long shall those precious  souls  redeemed by thy blood  be led astray  may i not fly on the wings  of love  and destroy that city of blasphemy on the seven hills  that  the glory may be thine   but jesus looked on him with an eye of love   and said   simon  son of jonas  the time is not yet come   then peter  only replied   lord  thou knowest  thy will be done       while in this joyful state  i walked in the green pastures of life  i  went round about the holy city  and counted its towers  they were all  of purest gold  and built with skill divine  i looked from the top of  one of them  and beheld the sea of glass  and also caught a glimpse of  the abyss  enough to see that the enemies of our god were all beneath  his feet  i could see some  once my friends among them  but i could  say   holy and just art thou  o lord god  and o  wonderful grace  that  has made such as i to differ       but while thus filled with praise  and delighting myself in that ocean  of love  i awoke  yet only to say   blessed are the dead that die in  the lord   dear friends  let us cleave to christ on earth  until he  plants our feet on the mount zion above      the next composition was written by nargis  of geog tapa  in       it  is an account of hannah  the mother of samuel  and gives a very good  idea of the bible knowledge of the pupils  and their interest in  scripture themes  the allusions to the condition of nestorian families   illustrate  and are illustrated by  the statements of chapter i      about three thousand years ago  the family of elkanah dwelt on the  hill of zophim  in palestine  he was a just man  and one that feared  god  according to the custom of those days  he had two wives  peninnah  and hannah  let us turn our thoughts to hannah  for every memory of her  is pleasant  she had no son  on whom she could look as a staff of joy  for her old age  yet hannah had a worthy portion in the love of  elkanah  which flowed unceasingly like a crystal stream  why was she  thus loved  we believe because of the lovely spirit which she had  received from that gentleness of the eternal son which maketh great   and  like him  her voice was not heard in the streets  instead of the  contentious temper of the women of this age  we find in her a meek and  quiet spirit  instead of pride  humility  and instead of anger   patience  she was kind  pleasant  and abounding in other graces  shall  not such a woman be praised      now elkanah took his family to shiloh  to worship and feast before the  lord  but the envious peninnah so grieved hannah that she could neither  eat nor drink  soon  however  she heard the sweet tones of her  husband s voice  was it not like an angel s  saying   hannah  why  weepest thou  and why eatest thou not  and why is thy heart grieved  am  i not better to thee than ten sons   when she heard that she arose and  ate  love was rewarded by love  she would not grieve elkanah  unlike  many in our day  she was obedient to her husband  yielding her will to  his  and clothed with humility  they were not only one flesh  but one  spirit  and they walked together in the valley of love to that world  where love is made perfect  now  after she had shown her love by  partaking of the feast     may we not suppose that she arose and  whispered to elkanah to know if he would approve of her intended vow   and did he not reply   your vow is mine   then did she not seek a  corner of the court where she might pray  radiant spot  where hannah  communed with god  herself a bright light among the women of that age   there  in bitterness of soul  she wept before the lord  and obtained  his blessing  she believed that god would grant her request  as he saw  best  and gave back her expected son to the lord to be his forever   here was true faith  she left all with god  and though  like her  saviour  she prayed the more earnestly  still her voice was not heard   but we hear the voice of eli   how long wilt thou be drunken    o eli   eli  why speak to her thus  she was of thy flock  and thou shouldst  have distinguished her from other women round about her    footnote     in oriental families  anger is shown by refusing to eat  sometimes for  several days       bright star of that generation  blessed art thou among the daughters  of levi  the moving of thy lips is like the voice of the dove  there  was a blessing in thy mouth  like the olive leaf of noah s dove  that  told of rest from the tossings of the flood  for thy request was about  to give rest to the millions of israel  blessed art thou  daughter of  zion  thou soughtest not a son for thy own glory  but for the glory of  thy god      what a prayer was hannah s  it brought a deliverer and a prophet to  israel  an intercessor and a preacher to the people of god  may the  daughters of hannah and the sons of elkanah be multiplied among our  people  she is a mirror into which we may look  to learn how to forsake  our evil ways  let us  like her  build up the kingdom of our lord jesus  christ      her prayer finished  hannah returned to her house  her sorrow was now  turned into joy  and her happy face was like the opening rose of the  morning  no wonder she was joyful  the will of the lord was her will   and what evil could befall her  blessed israel  that contains such a  praying soul      time passes on  and the answer to that prayer is a beloved son  the  grateful mother calls him samuel   god heard   her full heart could  give no other name to this child of prayer  she would remember ever   not mine  but god s  and now the childless one folds in her arms a  child of the covenant  new joy fills the heart of elkanah  their son  was new to them every day  yet not alone as theirs  but his who  answered prayer      the time now draws near for them to go again to shiloh  the happy  father does not forget god in his mercies  he appears before the lord  with his thank offering   a noble example to us  he asks hannah to go  with him  not in a voice of harsh command  but in love he said   will  you go   and it was  doubtless  a gentle voice that answered   not now   for then i must bring samuel back with me  he is too small to leave   but when he is weaned  i will bring him  that he may appear before the  lord  and there abide forever   the good elkanah was satisfied  saying    only the lord establish his word   for he had not forgotten the vow   so the happy hannah remained at home another year  and taught the child  as a mother only can      when the time came to go up again to shiloh  samuel was probably three  years old  that praying mother did not say   he is small  let him stay  with me one year longer   no  with her whole heart she carried him to  the house of the lord  to abide there  and she went not up empty   saying   it is enough that i give my son   but in the three bullocks we  find the burnt offering  the sin offering  and the peace offering  and  in her son the first fruits besides  she was ready to say   in all  things i am a debtor to the lord       nor did she come in pride of spirit  saying to eli   you called me  drunken  while offering a prayer that god hath heard   but in all  humility she accosts the aged priest  saying   i am the woman that  stood by thee here  praying   and then  leading forward the child   for  this child i prayed  and the lord hath given me my petition  and i have  lent him to the lord   we seem to see little samuel approaching eli  reverently  and then turning those speaking eyes to his mother  he  says   is this my father  of whom you told me  and with whom i am to  live    yes  my child  he will be your father   and now eli places his  hand upon the head of samuel  saying   blessed art thou  son of a true  daughter of levi  the lord bless thee  and make thee a prophet of the  most high       hannah worships  and returns to her home  her little son asks not to  go with her  for he has been taught that he is the lord s  and is to  abide in shiloh  what a blessing are praying mothers  training their  children for god      still she does not forget the lord s samuel  every year she goes up to  shiloh  with her husband  and as often does she carry for the little  prophet a coat  made by a mother s loving hand  she did not say  like  some of our mothers   if he is in the school of the prophets  let the  prophets clothe him   but she clothed him for the lord s service  and  he comforted eli as he was never comforted by his own children  will  our mothers follow the example of hannah  should a voice come from the  mountains to day  calling for preachers  would they give their sons to  go and save the lost  blessed are those mothers who give their sons to  be soldiers of the cross  who  like hannah  lead the way to the throne  of grace  and serve god in their households      the lord helped hannah to pray  and he helped her to write that  beautiful song  her words are golden and full of wisdom  it is fitting  to call her a mother in israel  deborah sat as judge  but hannah gave a  judge and teacher to the people of god  both were bright stars  but  where is the people on whom they shone  the chosen people are  scattered  deborah  perchance  sleeps under the oak of judgment  and  hannah on the hill of zephim  we love to think that her son stood by  her dying bed to thank her for all her prayers and instructions  and  see her reverently gathered to her people      we leave thee  mother of the holy prophet  thou hast passed through  this valley of humiliation  thy works follow thee  and thy god hath  crowned thee with glory and honor  sweet singer of israel  sing on in  heaven  for with thy saviour thou canst never sorrow more  who will  rise among us to carry forward the kingdom of our christ  such as honor  the master here  he will honor when mothers in israel see their sons  made kings and priests unto the lord forever            chapter xxi       kind offices     hospitality of nestorians   kindness of pupils   bathing feet   letters  of gozel  hanee  sanum of gawar  munny  raheel  and  marta   hoshebo   raheel to mrs  fiske   mourning for the  dead   nazloo   hoshebo s bereavement   death of missionary  children   letter fbom sarah  daughter of joseph     the foregoing pages have told something of the change that grace has  wrought among women in persia  let us now look at some points in that  change more carefully     the nestorians are noted for their hospitality  kindness to strangers  is regarded as a part of their religion  and if  after bringing out the  choicest of their stores  it is said  even in a strange language   how  can i eat this   or   who could endure a dish like that    the words  may be unintelligible  but not so the look and tone of the speaker  yet  even such treatment often only calls forth additional efforts to  please  a stranger may not relish some of their dishes  yet a spirit of  kindness would be careful not to let this appear  in the seminary  the  pupils studied how to please  even in the folding of a table napkin   and the kind hearted steward was perfectly delighted when reminded that  the pains he took in the preparation of a meal was so much service to  christ  because it strengthened his servants to labor for him     the girls were very kind to each other  when any one was sick  her  companions not only readily performed her share of domestic work  but  nursed her tenderly besides  if their teachers were ill  they coveted  the privilege of attending them by night and by day  it may comfort  some timid one to know  that in oroomiah miss fiske never had a  missionary sister with her by night in sickness  not that they were  backward to come  but the services of the pupils left nothing to be  desired  it did good like a medicine to see those girls  once coarse  and uncouth  showing even kindness in a way offensive to refined  feelings  now move with noiseless step  anticipating every wish  they  sought to conform every thing to the home tastes of their teachers  and  yet there was nothing of that show of effort that says   see how much  we do for you   they seemed to feel that they could not do too much  or  do it well enough  if miss fiske was exhausted and feeble during the  day  they might say nothing at the time  and not trouble her even to  answer a question  but when they supposed she was ready to retire   there would be a gentle knock on the door  sometimes on more than one  door  and then  with a  teacher  you looked tired to day  shall we come  in and bathe your feet  the water is warm  and every thing ready    their loving service would not cease  till every thing was in its  place  and they had put out the light after she retired     woman  there  as in the days of our saviour  still bathes the feet of  the guest whom she wishes to honor  and sometimes  when stooping over  them  she rubs them gently with her loosely flowing hair  not as a  substitute for a towel  but as a token of kindly welcome  this  privilege belongs to the oldest daughter of the family  and the custom  once liable to perversion  now shines with new beauty  as the  expression of christian love  he who once accepted the service in his  own person  will hereafter say  to many a daughter of chaldea    inasmuch as ye did it unto one of the least of these my brethren  ye  did it unto me      their tender sympathy with the afflicted was not confined to their own  household  in january        miss fiske was absent at seir  assisting  in taking care of mr  stoddard in his last illness  and from a number  of letters written to her  at that time  by her pupils  we select the  following       january  st           many of your flock have observed this as a day of fasting and prayer   and all have looked on it as a blessed day  the pleasant voice of  prayer has been heard during all its hours  and it seems as if the  saviour was about to come among us with great power  i trust that he  will work in many hearts by the holy spirit  we greatly desire to have  you here  but again  with all our hearts  we wish you to do for the  sick one whom we love  yes  if each pupil were to write to you  all  would say  we wish you to remain  and do all you can for him  and may  he be raised up again to labor for our poor people  give our love to  mrs  stoddard  and tell her we are glad to have the one we greatly  love  with her at this time     your daughter  gozel     january  d           my heart is drawn towards you all the time  but i thank god that he has  given you strength to do for our beloved brother mr  stoddard  i am  very much distressed when i think of him  and can only say   the will  of the lord be done   i greatly desired to hear your voice yesterday   it was indeed a blessed day  give my love to mrs  stoddard  and though  it is hard for her to bear these bitter pains  tell her to try to trust  the lord of our beloved brother     peace be to you  hanek     the next is written by a graduate  who was then on a visit at the  seminary       january  d           i cannot tell you what great anxiety and anguish i have for mr   stoddard  he has won my whole heart by taking so much pains for my dear  companions  and particularly for elisha  i did not think he would be  taken from us  this trial seems to me heavier than losing elisha and  jonathan  her children  who died by poison   for it is not only a loss  to his dear family  but also to this band of stranger missionaries  and  a dreadful desolation to our poor people  may the lord see how great is  the harvest  and how few the laborers  i cannot write more  my eyes  fail because of my tears  give my tenderest love to dear mrs  stoddard   i know her sorrows in such trying days  would that i could help her     from your truly afflicted pupil     sanum     the following was written the day after the death of mr  stoddard   which took place the   d of january  and refers to that sad  occurrence       january   d           what bitter intelligence comes to us these days   the taking away of  those who carried us in the arms of love to the blood stained cross of  christ  truly  my mother  these afflictions fall very heavily on our  heads  the guides of our souls are cut off from us  what shall we do     dearly loved sister mrs  stoddard  sorrow and mourning are ours  there  is hope that you will soon meet the ornament of your life  but in his  school and in ours are those for whom there is no hope that they will  ever see him  wounded sister  blessed is the heavenly pilgrim who has  spent his life in a strange land  and been a well of living water to  many thirsty souls  i know this separation is bitter to you  but there  is consolation for you  for it is not eternal  but what shall i say of  our poor people     o  how much more than any of you knew we loved that dear brother  it  was a quarter past three o clock this morning when your letter reached  us  miss fiske s   i handed it to miss rice  and never saw such a  bitter night except that in which my father died  i did not sleep till  almost dawn  and when i slept  i saw the loved one standing in miss  rice s room  his face shining like the morning star  both his hands  were raised to heaven  when suddenly he stooped and looked in my face   i said   o  you are not dead   he answered   no   and i cried aloud    o  mr  stoddard is not dead   and my own voice awoke me  how favored  those of you are who see the face of our beloved friend     munny     still later  she writes to her teacher  who was again at seir  during  the sickness of harriette stoddard  whose death occurred march   th            though it is a time of anguish  yet  blessed be god  he has given us  one to whom we may look for comfort  a thousand thanks to the saviour  that he does not chastise us by taking away the holy spirit  though the  discipline is bitter  yet it is mingled with love  in that the lord  comes by death among his own  and by his spirit to those who have not  known him  that he may make them his own also  what grief would the  lovers of the lord have  if you now sat by the bedside of a sister of  whom we had no evidence that her heart was purified by a saviour s  blood  if you are so distressed about one whom you trust your father is  taking to rest in the bosom of his son  how would you feel if she were  one of those who  as soon as the breath left her body  would dwell with  everlasting burnings  how thankful we should be that it is not the bed  of one of these     i have never seen such a trying year  but i do not believe it is for  the harm of those that fear the lord  it only fulfils the promise    whom the lord loveth he chasteneth   o that the gentle voice of jesus  might be heard  whispering   daughter  i say unto thee  arise   who  knows but  if our faith were as christ would have it  he would call  this sister back to life  though now so near to death  but your father  knows what is for your good  and you know that here he often gives  anguish to those who love him  that they may be exceedingly joyful with  him hereafter  the lord grant that these afflictions do not harden our  hearts     i have conversed and prayed with all the younger girls  save two   eleven say that they are resolved to follow christ  but i fear lest the  vineyards and the cotton fields do not testify hereafter that they have  walked with god  it is very pleasant to me to sit down by them and ask  them of their state     yesterday  sabbath  was a delightful day  but it seemed very short  the  lord help us in our weakness  and cause the dark clouds to rise from  all your friends  the god of consolation heal the wounded spirit of  your poor sister  mrs  stoddard  i have never seen the death of the  righteous  only by hearing have i heard of it  the lord be with you  more and more     munny     others  written during the same period  are as follows       sorrower for us  who hast also become as a stranger to us   now we know  your anxious love for us  we have no doubt that he who directs not  according to man s thoughts has directed you to be away from us much  this year  we had thought that it would be a very pleasant year  but  the lord has ordered it as he pleases  and let us say   his will be  done   we know that he does all for our profit  what a comfort this is  to us who have given our all to the saviour to do with us as he will     it is very hard to look at your vacant place  but we thank god it is  not made vacant by death  though not with us in body  we believe that  you are  in spirit  and we rejoice that you can do as few can  for the  sick  the lord be with you  who are the second in anguish  and  strengthen your weak body  the prayer of your pupils is ever for your  life  we have no words with which to comfort you  we can only say   the  saviour  with whom you are better acquainted than we are  give you  comfort      what can we say to you  dear mrs  stoddard  who are shrouded in a cloud  that is very dark  we know it is very hard for you to look on the great  vacancy that is made in your dwelling  but do trust in the lord  he  will bring light out of darkness  we feel for you  plunged in a sea of  sorrow  in the deep places of sighs  our eyes are every hour upon the  door  expecting what we shall hear from harriette  and our prayer is   that if it can be the lord s will  she may be brought back to you  but  every letter increases our anxiety  we understand not the lord s  dealings this year  except this  we know that he does all things for  the profit of our souls     raheel     marta     the writer of the following was at that time a teacher in the seminary   and a striking illustration of the elevating power of a good education   formerly a female who was either lame or deformed was so despised  that  she could never hope to be the head of a family  she was doomed to drag  through a miserable life  the object of universal neglect  but hoshebo   though a fall in early youth had shattered her ankle  and the ignorance  of native surgeons made her a cripple for life  yet because of her  education was as much esteemed as before she would have been despised   and is now the wife of meerza  our native helper at saralon  miss fiske  might have filled up her school with such  but  with a wise foresight   selected her pupils with an eye to their future usefulness among the  people  as well as their own personal advantage     when i understood from miss rice  that you would not meet your loved  flock next sabbath  i felt that i could not let all your absence pass  without giving you an account of my charge  i have been sitting with  them  as i do every saturday evening  to search out their spiritual  state  and i have good news to tell you of one for whom you  and also  others  have been very anxious  esli  of takka  i noticed her changed  all this week  but last night i saw a great breaking down under mr   cochran s preaching  she came out in anguish of soul  i then saw her  alone  and found her contrition still increasing  i know this is not  evidence that she has passed from death unto life  but i rejoice that  she is visited by the holy spirit  and i trust she will become a  christian  i am anxious for her and for all the girls of my room  i  look for the gentle shower that shall make the withered plants like the  fresh springing grass  though you are absent  we know well that you  carry every one of your flock in the arms of love to him who can do all  things  whether you are far away or near to us  the girls send up many  petitions for harriette  we fear much when we recall your former going  to seir  how glad should we be to hear of indications that she will  recover  peace and love to mrs  stoddard     your affectionate    hoshebo     more than a year after this  miss fiske left oroomiah  and at salmas   on her way home  met her dear pupil sanum  the wife of joseph  having  no other place for devotion  they retired together to an orchard for  the parting prayer  in a subsequent letter  sanum thus beautifully  alludes to it        o  the remembrance of that bitter separation  and of those prayers   when the green grass was watered with our tears  how could i have borne  it  but for the recollection of him who prayed and wept in the garden  of gethsemane  and whose kneeling upon the tender grass was for the  comfort of our souls      the gratitude of the pupils to their teacher extended also to her aged  mother  seldom have they written a letter to miss fiske  in america   without its message of kind remembrance to the parent who gave up her  daughter  as hannah gave up samuel  to be the lord s  and several wrote  letters to her separately  from among these we select the following   written by raheel  rachel   of geog tapa  sept    th             my dear grandmother hannah  though i have never seen you  yet i must  write to you  for i love all miss fiske s friends as i do my own  and  especially yourself  i want to thank you for all your love to me   blessings have thus reached me which were not given to my early  sisters  when it was a great reproach for a girl to learn to read  god  had mercy on us in that he poured such love into your heart as made you  willing to send your daughter eight thousand miles  by sea and land  to  show our people the great mystery that had been previously hidden from  their eyes  that there is salvation for women  they used to dwell much  on those words of solomon   one man among a thousand have i found  but  a woman among all these have i not found   but now they see their  mistake  and that christ died for women also  many thanks for your  patience all these years  i know something of it from the feelings of  my own mother  for if she did not see me for five months during term  time  she would mourn that she had not seen her daughter for so long     it was certainly a sacrifice for christ to come into this world  and  deny himself  and it was also a sacrifice for the father to send his  son  when he knew all the sorrows and wounds there were in the cup  which he was to drink in this world of sin     you will see your daughter much changed from what she was fifteen years  ago  but i am confident that when that day comes  which will be longer  than any day we have seen in this world   when he whom the jews could  not bear to hear called king  shall sit upon his throne  judging the  world   then all troubles  sorrows  and separation from friends will  appear to the christian as the small dust of the balance  and i think  that it will especially seem so to you  when you see a band of  nestorian girls on the right hand of the redeemer  whom you  through  your daughter  were the means of bringing there  yes  justly might they  have been left to dwell with satan forever  but instead of that  they  will have joyful life with christ in his kingdom     i can never repay your love  but there is one so rich that he can give  you what man cannot  and i ask him to reward you in heaven     is there another miss fiske in your country  we can hardly believe it   i hope that i shall see her again  but it is difficult for me to expect  it     it is very pleasant for me to write to friends  and especially to my  own dear mother  miss fiske  i should never be weary if i wrote to her  every day  but i thought that this time she would like to have me write  to you  and i trust that you will live to receive it     please give my love to martha  and also to mrs  stoddard and sarah  and  tell them that our hearts are with them     from your granddaughter  whom you have not seen     raheel     no reader of the bible needs any description of oriental mourning for  the dead  the rent garments and sackcloth    sam  iii       loud  weeping and wailing  ver       protracted lamentation as for jacob   gen       and      and for moses  deut  xxxiv      and the hired  mourning women  jer  ix      and matt  ix       were to be found  nowhere in greater perfection than among the nestorians  it is very  difficult for us  in this land  to realize the force of such habits   but it required much grace to break over them  and even now  when the  christian heart grows cold  it is apt to return to the old ways  one  day  in       the whole school were going to attend a funeral  when the  time came  one of the pupils requested to be excused   why  are you  sick    no    why not go  then    i do not wish to tell   but another  said   may i tell you alone    it will be a great shame if we do not  all weep  we all think we can do it but sarah  and we are afraid her  tears will not come  and so  lest she bring reproach upon us  we do not  want her to go   the heart of the teacher sunk within her  as she found  that she was about to lead a company of mourning women to the funeral   she asked them how they could make themselves weep   o  when we go to  such places  we call to mind all the sad things we ever knew  and so we  weep  but if the tears do not come  we leave very quickly      but grace has wrought a great change in this matter also  in the  journal of yonan  we find the following entry   at the close of  afternoon service  i had a bible class with the women  this was  followed by a prayer meeting  then munny came to see me  she has buried  a little child recently  it is a matter of joy to me  that these women  can lift up their eyes and see their children with the dear saviour   and feel that they have treasures in heaven  i asked her   did you ever  do any thing for your little girl that you remember now with  gratitude    many times i carried her with me to the stable  and knelt  with her upon the straw in the manger  to ask blessings on her     christ was in the manger  and perhaps there your daughter was  consecrated to him       in another place  we find him asking esli   the wife of joseph  of whom  he had just said   her little daughter has died recently  and her heart  is broken     when your child died  did you weep and wail as your  people do   and she answered   no      nazloo  of vizierawa  a pupil who hoped she took christ for her saviour  in       and graduated in       within less than a year after her  conversion was summoned to the death bed of her uncle  and scarcely had  she returned to her studies before she was called to the bedside of her  father  for three days she watched with him incessantly  by day and by  night  those who were present were greatly moved by her tender care of  him  during the whole of his sickness  she never failed to improve  every opportunity to point him to christ  even to the last  she begged  him to look to the lamb of god and live  and when he died  with his  head resting on her hand  though she had no evidence that her efforts  were successful  her wonderful calmness  under so severe a stroke  led  many to feel that she possessed a source of consolation to which they  were strangers  but her cup was not yet full  a few days passed  and  she hastened once more to her afflicted home  to find her mother  entering the dark valley  others wept aloud  but she pointed the dying  one to jesus  and supporting her in her loving arms  she seemed to  plant her feet in the cold waters of the river of death  and commit her  departing mother into the hands of him who could bear her safely to the  other side  so sensible was her mother of the benefit she and hers had  received from the school  that when the teacher came in  she beckoned  her to her side  and said  with difficulty   god is not willing i  should be a mother to my daughters any longer  i commit them to you   they are yours   she soon fell asleep  as was hoped  in jesus  after  this  nazloo was in the school most of the time till her marriage  as a  teacher  no one could have been more faithful  her religious experience  was very marked  and she labored wisely for souls  she still lives to  show how god can make grievous afflictions yield the peaceable fruit of  righteousness in his people     in this connection  we cannot omit another letter  written by hoshebo  to her teacher  in       on the death of her son absalom  it is dated  saralon  where she and her husband meerza reside     dear mother  i received your letter just before i received a bitter  stroke from the never erring hand of my heavenly father  many thanks  for your loving remembrances of me  i cannot reward you for one of a  thousand of the good things that you have shown me  so unworthy  i have  many thoughts of you  and of those pleasant days that we passed  together in that blessed school  i am very sad when i think that  perhaps i may never  in this house of my pilgrimage  see your face   which makes others to be exceeding glad     dear mother  like a daughter distressed  who would find a little rest  by falling into the kind arms of her mother  i come to tell you what  has pierced the heart of your poor child  it is true that you are so  far from me that i cannot lean on your kind breast  and let you lead me  in prayer to the father who has afflicted me  but with a feeling like  that i write you  beloved  you used to write me that i must take good  care of my dear and tender babe  aweshalom  perhaps i did not fully do  as you told me  but one thing i know  the lord  who loves little  children  was not willing that i should keep him  and i believe that he  will take better care of my dear child than i could  you must know that  i am deeply wounded and crushed by the death of aweshalom  my tears  cease not  his first birth was october           his second and  spiritual one  april           his life with us was a pleasant one  and  he made our lives very sweet and delightful  but now he has gone to  heaven  while we remain on the earth  he lives the new life  while we  die daily  he is strong  while i am weak  he has grown beautiful  in  the light and image of the saviour  while i am pining away  if you have  heard what a child he was  you will not wonder at my sickness since his  death  my husband is greatly afflicted in the death of this  our first   our only child  we find no comfort except in casting our wounded souls  at the feet of the saviour  who was tempted that he might heal our  wounds  it seems  sometimes  as if our comforters were far from us  but  our saviour is very near to help and comfort     our work has been as last year  my husband has taught in the seminary  at seir  coming here to preach on the sabbath  i have taught a school  of eighteen boys and girls here  before vacation  my babe sickened  and  rested in jesus  since that time  i have had fever  and am still very  weak     five in the village  besides ourselves  are communicants  my father and  brother are among them  i trust that my mother and brother s wife will  soon unite with us  the work of the lord in the village goes forward  better than formerly  i try to talk and pray with the women alone  and  they are more ready to have me do it  which makes me to rejoice in the  lord     give my loving peace to my dear grandmother hannah  though with the  eyes of this mortal body we have not seen each other  nor have i any  hope that we shall  the lord her god help me  that we may meet on the  blessed hill of zion above  i believe  my mother  that you will  remember your weak  unworthy lamb  when you bow before the throne of  mercy and grace  perhaps this is the last letter you will receive from  me  for death seems very near  receive loving peace from the priest   her husband      your true daughter     hoshebo     jesus has seemed to be almost bodily present  taking up these lambs in  his arms  and the mothers have not feared  for they felt sure that  under such a guardian it was well with their children     perhaps bereaved missionary mothers in persia do not realize how much  their patient suffering has done for their poor nestorian sisters  the  short lives of those twenty missionary children  who lie in persian  graves  were a precious offering to christ  they were all missionaries   and did not go home till their work was done  each one had a place to  fill among the instrumentalities employed by the master to promote his  kingdom in persia  there was no waste in the breaking of those  alabaster boxes of precious ointment  nestorian parents looked on  to  learn how to lay their children into the arms of jesus  and become more  christ like themselves  no years of mature toil have been more blessed  than the years of those thus early called home  and in this truth their  bereaved parents may find abundant consolation  there are influences  too deep and silent to be fully understood  but they are none the less  real and powerful  and the mother who to day misses the little feet   the loving eyes  and the pleasant voice  which god had lent to gladden  her earthly home for a season  may rejoice in the assurance that her  loving submission to a father s hand is teaching a lesson to the people  whom she loves  such as they could never learn from words     during the revival of       a little child of dr  perkins died  and as  the missionaries laid it away  in the hope of a glorious resurrection   it helped them to point others to him who is the resurrection and the  life  it was buried on a snowy sabbath day  and the faces of the young  converts  who stood in silence around the grave  showed that to them  the associations of death were no longer fearful  turning away from the  cemetery  mr  stoddard  feeling that he could not be separated from  those young disciples even in death  said   do you not hope that you  shall rest here to rise with these to everlasting life      little did  they who heard him know how soon that cemetery at seir would become  more sacred as his own resting place   footnote    see nestorian  biography  page          before leaving this topic  we insert a letter from sarah  daughter of  joseph  a former pupil in the seminary  and the oldest of four sisters   the death of little deborah seemed to draw her heart very closely to  her saviour  and she now sleeps by her side  doubtless understanding  better the meaning of those arms of love that here she believed  folded  her little sister in his own bosom       what word of fitting love can i write  and how tell you what god has  done  we are afflicted  for he has taken from us our dear little  deborah  she was only two years and seven months old  we mourn  and yet  are comforted  for we know that he who loves little children has taken  her into his own arms  that we may love him more and better praise his  glorious name  she did not leave us to go to a stranger  the dear  saviour  we think  has made her happier than we could  and now we dwell  much on this scripture   prepare to meet thy god   deborah was very  sick  and suffered much  but when she died  there was a pleasant smile  on her little face  then she rested from sorrow  and jesus folded the  little iamb in his own bosom            chapter xxii       progress and promise     benevolence  early manifestation of   progress   revival of benevolence  in april         interest of parents for the conversion of their  children   peace in families   reformed  marriages   ordinations   communion seasons   miss rice and miss  beach   conclusion     the pupils were early trained to form habits of self denying  benevolence  in       the day scholars made as many as fifty garments  for poor children  early in       when some mountaineers came to beg  money for their ragged children  the question was put   who will give  her own clothes and wear poorer ones till she can make others   many  responded at once  and she who gave her best dress was deemed the most  happy  some even wept because they could not do the same  in a letter  written december        the pupils say   the last day of the term was  monthly concert  we had a good time of prayer  and then a collection   which went up to thirty two sahib korans   seven dollars   we hope this  will be increased  and used for sending the gospel to the poor people  of the mountains      they were accustomed to devote several hours a week to sewing for some  benevolent object  at the close of one term the articles thus prepared  were sold for sixteen dollars  and the proceeds sent to aintab to pay  for teaching women there to read     the same virtue was assiduously cultivated in the people  deacons john  and yonan had for some time been urged to take up a collection at the  monthly concert at geog tapa  but they dared not try  not that they did  not wish it  but they feared that the people  in their poverty  might  take offence at the innovation  at length  on the first sabbath of        john preached on the subject  and a few korans  worth twenty  cents each   were contributed  the first sabbath of february it was  yonan s turn to preach there  so he prepared himself thoroughly on this  subject   miss fiske had read with him the prize essays on benevolence   published by the american tract society   and  carrying his map into a  crowded church  he spoke at some length about missions in various parts  of the world  his account was well received  then bibles were  distributed through the church  and the readers were called on to read  passages previously selected  showing  first  the antiquity of  benevolent contributions  secondly  that the poor were to give as well  as the rich  and thirdly  that the blessing of god was promised to the  benevolent  the readers were scattered all over the church  and the  people listened with great attention  then several spoke on the  subject  and the elders of the village gave the work their hearty  approval  afternoon came  and as the time for meeting drew near  old  and young were eagerly engaged in getting ready their contributions  in  geog tapa the monthly concert is held on sabbath afternoon   and as  many as two hundred came together  there were remarks and prayers  and  while the missionary hymn was being sung at the close  the collection  was taken up  amounting  in money and cotton yarn  to more than fifteen  korans  one sick boy  who had heard what was going on  rose from his  bed  and crept in to deposit his little coin  instead of spending their  saints  days in idleness  as had been the custom  many now wrought on  those days to earn money for giving  saying to objectors that it was  better to labor for the spread of the gospel than to be idle for satan   mr  stoddard attended the march concert  with some idols from india   and so interested the people that the collection amounted to more than  twenty five korans  thus the good work went on     after this the spirit of benevolence steadily increased  and instances  of marked self denial were not wanting  it shows at once their poverty  and their disposition to do what they could  that at the monthly  concert a basket was passed round along with the contribution box  to  receive eggs from the little children and such as were too poor to give  any thing else  crosses of ivory or silver were often found among the  contributions     one day  a man was seen to take a silver coin out of his purse  and as  the missionary went on to describe more of the condition of the heathen  world  a second and a third was taken out  and held in readiness for  the collection  at another time  a woman  whom she had not seen before   asked for a private interview with one of the ladies of the mission   and when alone  besides requesting prayer that she might become a  christian  she took out a gold ornament  the only one of any value that  she possessed  which had been handed down as an heirloom in her family  for several generations  and said she wanted to give that to send the  gospel to others  only no one must know who gave it  the ornament was  sold for four dollars and fifty cents  and the woman  in less than a  year  became a useful christian  sometimes the amount of interest might  be measured by the number of silver coins manufactured into buttons  that were found in the contribution box  for when their feelings were  aroused  the women cut off the fastenings of their outer garments  and  cast them into the lord s treasury     but the most remarkable revival of benevolence occurred in april         and we condense the following account of it from a long letter of yonan  to miss fiske and mrs  stoddard        the prayers and tears of our missionary friends have  this winter   received a joyful reward from our father in heaven  we were told that  the first week in january would be devoted by all christians to prayer  for great things  and my heart was never so enlarged before  it seemed  as if persia  nominal christendom  and all the heathen were under the  power of prayer  as if the christian s measuring line was stretched  round the four corners of the earth  one day the missionaries met  as  usual  for prayer in dr  wright s large room  it moved me much  and i  said to my companions   they are praying for us while we are idle    they said   it is good that we spend this half hour in prayer every  day   we did so  on the sabbath  i went to my village  geog tapa  and  mentioned these things to the people at the evening meeting  the lord  opened the mouth of abraham  who said   brethren  in these places we  are always idle  let us meet for prayer half an hour before sunset    they did so  the clouds over our heads seemed loaded with blessings   still they did not descend  mr  cobb and mr  ambrose had talked with me  about commencing in our village to support preachers in the mountains   so did mr  labaree last week  i told him of our poverty  he said   i am  grieved for that  but begin with some little thing       we went to geog tapa the last sabbath in march  john gave notice  as  it was the gospel sabbath   monthly concert is so called   of the  contributions for our brothers in india  in his sermon he said that  much of our poverty is from our indolence  last year our collection was  fifteen tomans   a toman is about two dollars   if we had more zeal  we  might raise twenty  and that would support a preacher in the mountains   at once guwergis cried out   i will give one   i said   we will support  one preacher and two schools among ourselves  and if any thing is over   we will send it far away   priest abraham approved of this  then all  the brethren in the congregation began to speak   so is good    thus we  will do   john would have stilled them  but i said   perhaps god is  blessing your preaching  let them speak   praised be god s name  forever  in a moment every obstacle was swept away  had we known that  god was so near  we would have bowed our heads before him  now aib khan  cried   i give one toman   and  i   said priest moses   twelve korans    and another   i two monats    a monat is seventy five cents   moses now  took out his pencil to write  the malik said   i have often thought  that i would put a gold imperial in the box  four dollars and fifty  cents   write that   i then said   my family of eight souls hear  preaching all the year  and three or four attend school  i am a debtor   write for me three tomans  it is not too much   when god pleases   excuses flee away  high prices and oppression were not thought of  we  were lords of wealth  moses then said   i am troubled that i remain to  the last  but we are three brothers in company  and i know not whether  they will act through me  or each one for himself   one brother cried  out   our agent and i  five korans more   another man then said   i  also am at a loss on account of my brother   and his brother replied    four monats   these things made brotherly love very firm  guwergis now  cried out   women  where are you  in the wilderness women gave their  brazen mirrors   i said   holy women  to day ends fifteen years of the  prayers of christianity among us  speak    it was fifteen years since  the revival in        one replied   i half a monat   and  i a  head dress    i a silver ornament    i my earrings   and so on  a widow  said   i have kept my husband s coat till now  i will sell it  and give  half the price   and others made similar responses  isaac  a poor old  mountaineer  gave two korans  and another said   i have nothing but the  mat i sit on  i give that   it was a new one he had just finished  a  mother said   i have nothing now  but i will give the work of my hands  this winter  a tope  ten yards  of cotton cloth   a pilgrim said   when  i was in jerusalem  an armenian and a russian bid against each other   and the russian prevailed  giving five hundred tomans to the greek  convent  if they had such zeal for error  we ought to have more for the  truth   and one unaccustomed to come to church gave the fruit and  prunings of fifteen rows in his vineyard   the prunings of the vines  are sold for fuel   we were in the church about four hours  time was  given for all to contribute  and then we spent a season in joyful song  and pleasant prayer      the report of what had been done spread quickly through the village   and my mother in law sent word that she would give a hundred and  twenty eight pounds of raisins  at evening meeting  the house was full   benjamin said   brethren  the teacher of our school was one day  explaining the verse   thou shalt not muzzle the mouth of the ox that  treadeth out the corn   and mr  stoddard  who stood near  added   but  the nestorian oxen eat from the straw of america   that word has worked  in my heart ever since  i trust that  hereafter  we will eat our own  straw   that night we lay awake a long time for joy  in the morning   before i was up  my uncle and his wife came and promised a load of  wheat  five bushels   and when passing through the village  a woman put  an ornament in my pocket to sell for the cause      monday we came to the city for the gospel day  the concert is held  there on monday   and every one who met us remarked our glad faces  in  the meeting  after mr  coan spoke  john opened a bundle of the gifts   and moses described the scenes of the day before  i said   one toman  led to sixty in our village yesterday  perhaps it will lead to hundreds  more  many times the good in the heart of the christian comes up into  his mouth  and then goes back  but when the power of god prevails  it  not only comes into the mouth  but comes forth and abounds   priest  moses arose  and said   as long as a man is sick  it is no shame if he  does not walk  but if the blood walks well in his veins  and he becomes  fat  and still lies in bed  every one reproaches him  we have grown  fat  and how long shall we lie under the quilts   priest yakob added    for twenty five years we have said   let the lord go before   and now  that he has come  let us wait no longer  but give   he gave two tomans   and others followed  mar tohanan s wife gave a toman of ornaments  and  almost every girl in school from one koran to three or four  isras  of  degala  gave fifteen tomans and a new vineyard that he had recently  bought  guwergis  who had already proposed to plough the field the  second time  now rose  and opening his hand  said   if a man thrust his  hand into a pile of gold  and give of it to god  is it a great thing  when he has filled his hand with the blood of his son  and given it to  us   sagoo     of gulpashan  said   my father gave each of my two  sisters thirty tomans  when hannah died  hers became mine  i give it  for the bride s veil   the kingdom of christ is here spoken of as the  bride   also a silver watch   one who had only two or three sheep  promised one of them  my little girl  sherin  had asked  a few days  before  for a new dress  she now sent word to me that she would do  without it for a year  if i would give the money for the gospel  i  cannot fully describe the spirit of the meeting  we went out wondering  and congratulating each other at having witnessed such a pleasant  sight  at the evening meeting one said   i heard in the market what you  were doing  i give a gun  the price of which was seven and a half  tomans   some gave for themselves  and others for their wives and  children  moses gave four monats for his brother s children  there were  tithes and sixths  fifths and fourths  thirds and halves  of crops of  hay and grapes  priest abraham said   we say a thief will never own a  house  did you ever see one that had wealth  we are thieves  and  therefore are so poor  we have robbed god  i will give a tithe of my  vineyard   another replied   and i of every thing   and a man  who had  before given one quarter of his vineyard  now gave the half  a widow   who had nothing but a cow  pledged a hepta  four pounds  of butter  a  poor man  who has a few fruit trees in his yard  promised ten heptas of  apricots  guwergis spoke up   we have butter  what shall we cook in it  for the bride   a woman answered   i give four heptas of rice   to  which her husband added two   footnote    see page           mar elias now kissed us much  he put nineteen korans into john s hand   saying   as yet i have not grown indifferent   and mar yohanan said   with tears   the crown of the bride remains for me  i give thirty  tomans       in our village  besides the tithes  seventy tomans were collected  and  in the city two hundred and fifty  i hope the whole will go up to five  hundred or more  i stand amazed  i can think nothing but   i am a  miserable sinner   the glorious god has gone before us in mercy  for  two or three years our village was going down  we were at variance and  in trouble  but immanuel has met us with a blessing  a hundred fold  beyond our expectation  it is the beginning of a great work for future  generations  i know that the joy of heaven is awakened in the joy of  blessed mr  stocking and mr  stoddard  i want to fly to them and talk  with them about it  but this veil does not allow it  you  too  will  want to fly to the people that are so dear to you  i trust that this  pouring out of such a spirit will be the door of many blessings  we  have had a scarcity for seven years  so that wheat is six times its  former price  our people are poor and sorely oppressed  from the depths  of their poverty they have given  i never knew them before  if all were  christians  what might we not see  perhaps the poor widows and orphans   who have contributed for our good  have been discouraged  but truly  their gifts have not been sown in vain among our people  i believe at  the last day you will see fruit according to the word of jesus  thirty   sixty  and a hundred fold  the time is not far off when every converted  nestorian will go to ten mussulmen to teach them the word of god      pray for us more than ever  for many are the enemies of nehemiah and  ruined jerusalem  our hope is in god  he has begun  and he will finish      the pledges then made have since been fulfilled  with very few  exceptions  and that not regretfully  but with a heartiness truly  affecting to those who knew their poverty  in july        the mission  resolved to furnish no teacher for a school  except in new  villages  where a part of his support was not assumed by the people   the barandooz congregation  in the spring of       cheerfully assumed  the burden of their schools  and some have also expressed a readiness  to aid in the support of their pastors  a number of pupils  in both  seminaries  contribute liberally towards their support     in bringing to a close these glimpses of the changes wrought by grace  among the nestorians  we must not pass by the number of pious parents  who now aid the missionaries by their prayers  while  in the early days  of the seminary  its teacher was left to pray alone for her pupils   before she left  in       she rejoiced to know that two thirds of them  had either a pious parent  or other member of the family  who prayed  for their salvation     one cold morning  in       a pious mother walked three miles through  the snow  to inquire if there was any interest in the school   why do  you ask   replied the teacher   i have thought of you continually for  two or three days  and last night  after falling asleep  thinking about  you  i dreamed that god was visiting you by his holy spirit  so  when i  awoke  i arose and baked  and hurried here  i am so anxious about my  daughter  can i see her   she was told that her daughter was among the  inquirers the evening before  and sank down where she stood  weeping  for joy  the heart of the teacher grew strong in the feeling that the  mothers were wrestling with her  the mother passed into an adjoining  room to see her daughter  and a missionary brother  who came in just  then  could not restrain his tears as he listened to her earnest  intercessions  saying   this is more to me than any thing i have seen  in persia   after that year  some parents  when they came to the  seminary  were never willing to leave till they had prayed with their  children  a father once wrote   yesterday i invited some christian  friends to my house  and had three prayers offered for the school  and  while praying for you  we felt our own sins very much  and cried to god  to save us from their power      nor were the pupils wanting in interest for their impenitent parents   during the long vacation in       hanee  who used to spend several  hours a day in prayer for her mother  so pressed her with entreaties to  come to the saviour  that one day she roughly replied   enough  enough   stop your praying and weeping for me  you will weep yourself blind    o  mother   was the beautiful reply   it seems as though i would gladly  become blind  if thereby you might be brought to jesus      perhaps the effects of grace were nowhere more conspicuous than in the  effects it produced in those great households already described  let us  first look in on the hinderances they occasioned to a life of piety   yonan writes  in his journal of march           widow hatoon is a  devout woman  and tries to erect the family altar in her house  but it  is very difficult  she often collects the readers in the neighborhood  on sabbath morning  to read the bible with her family  i asked her   do  you pray with your children  they have no father  they are left in your  hands  and god will require them of you again    i do  but i find it  very hard in our house  we are all in one room  our beds very near each  other  and there is no separate chamber  when about to retire  i gather  them together behind a quilt  and talk and pray with them       again he writes   hatoon  the wife of sarhoosh  is a member of a large  family  three of the women in the house  and one of their husbands   fear god  but the older members of the household are very wicked  and  even violent in their opposition  she is much troubled about family  prayer  while the devout ones engage in worship at one end of the room   the rest  at the other end  talk  laugh  and revile      yet  even in such households  grace reveals its divine power  we find  yonan putting this question to a communicant   do you and m  live  pleasantly together   m  was her sister in law  in a household of more  than thirty souls   she is a little quick tempered   was the reply    but i try not to trouble her  and to have our love perfect that we may  be a good example to the rest   yonan prayed with her  and asked if he  could do any thing for her relatives   dear brother in christ   she  replied   in the name of the lord jesus  our precious saviour  i beg  you to pray with my husband  it maybe god will bless him    my sister   god will bless him  this your anguish shall be turned into joy    my  own heart was moved   adds the narrator   i saw my own love very  little  compared with hers  and felt my unworthiness very much      the change in their social condition was beautifully illustrated by a  little incident in the seminary  in       one of the older pupils had  been betrothed  but when the ring of betrothal was brought  to be  placed on her finger  she could not be found  after long search  her  gentle voice was heard in the most retired part of the building   imploring the blessing of god to abide with her in that new relation   only those who had seen the rioting and folly common on such occasions  could appreciate the change     the marriage of mar yohanan  in       was a step in the work of lifting  up woman to her true position  formerly  marriage had been deemed  something too unholy for a bishop  and the consequence was the general  degradation of the sex  the entrance of the gospel corrected public  sentiment on this point  and that act of the bishop only gave  expression to the popular conviction that marriage is honorable in all   even the highest and holiest  nurturing some of the loveliest graces of  the christian character  the event for a time caused some stir among  the enemies of the truth  but it soon died away  and the old ascetic  views of piety are passing away with the social degradation in which  they had their origin     about the same time yohanan  whom we have seen laboring in the  mountains with his estimable wife  was ordained to the work of the  ministry without any of the mummeries that had been added to the simple  usage of the new testament  the venerable mar elias uniting with the  missionaries in the laying on of the hands of the presbytery  two  months later  six more of the most pious and best educated young men   who had long deferred ordination through aversion to the old forms   followed his example  among them our mountain friend oshana  deacon  john  of geog tapa  and deacon yakob  of sapergan  marriage ceremonies  and entertainments have long been improved  and the revelling of former  days on such occasions is going into deserved disuse among the more  enlightened     in the year       the people of memikan left off keeping their fasts   on the ground that they tended to nullify salvation by grace through  jesus christ  formerly this would have brought down on them  the wrath  of the patriarch  their village would have been devoted to plunder and  the torch  and themselves to death or exile  but now it caused scarce a  ripple on the current of events  not that men did not see the drift of  things  but they allowed it to have free course     there is another sign of the times that calls for more special mention   other missions in western asia had been forced by persecution to the  early formation of churches  they had to provide a fold for the lambs  driven from their former shelter  here there had been no such  necessity  yet the converts longed for a more spiritual observance of  gospel ordinances     the mission had hitherto celebrated the lord s supper by themselves   and with one or two exceptions  no nestorian had witnessed its  observance  there had been some thought of admitting them  but nothing  had been done  till  in the spring of       three of the converts  who  had been reading an english treatise on the subject  asked one of the  ladies of the mission to intercede with the gentlemen to allow them to  be present  she informed mr  stoddard of their request  and he  encouraged them to go forward  the matter was laid before the mission   and it was concluded that a few of those judged most fit for admission  to the ordinance should be invited to partake     the first communion to which the converts were admitted was celebrated  in september        in the large room on the lower floor of the female  seminary  eleven nestorians partook with the missionaries  and three of  them were women  who had graduated there  after the service  some of  the men went up stairs and sat down without speaking  miss fiske  not  knowing the cause of their silence  and fearing lest they might have  been disappointed by the simplicity of our forms  did not venture to  allude to the subject  till one of them asked   is it always  so when  you commune  or was this an unusual occasion    why  did you not enjoy  it    not enjoy it  jesus christ himself seemed almost visibly present   it was difficult to realize that it was not the saviour in person who  presided at the table  it must have been just such a scene when the  ordinance was first instituted in jerusalem  and i could not get rid of  the inquiry   shall one of us go out like judas and betray him    it is  a significant fact that those most accustomed to mediaeval forms  when  regenerated by the spirit  relish them the least  and the more  spiritual they become  the more they crave the simple forms of the new  testament  because they draw the least attention to themselves  and fix  it most completely on the saviour     in january        as many as seventy of the converts  after careful  examination  were allowed to partake  and once every four months the  privilege was renewed  with an accession of from twelve to thirty  communicants each time  these were occasions of unusual interest   several days were devoted to religious meetings  and even in midwinter  pious people made long journeys  and crossed bleak mountains on the  snow  to attend them  one woman  hoimar  of salmas     travelled sixty  miles  through deep snow and piercing cold  to be present at this  ordinance in january         footnote    see page          in june of that year  the better to distinguish those entitled to this  privilege  before the sacrament all entered together into solemn  covenant with god  the whole number received up to that time was two  hundred and forty nine  at the close of       it had swelled to five  hundred  as the meetings became too unwieldy  and it was inconvenient  for so many to come so far  the ordinance was administered at seir  also  in september        and here providentially another end was  secured  for as dr  wright was then too sick to distribute the  elements  some of the natives had to perform that service  in june  following  a very interesting communion was observed at memikan   yohanan and his wife crossing a high mountain  even then covered with  snow  to bring their little child for baptism  next year  the ordinance  was celebrated in every village where there was a sufficient number of  hopeful converts to justify its observance  thus has god led his  people  step by step  in a way that they knew not  till now there are  all the essentials of a church at every place where god has raised up  members of the body of christ  they enter into covenant with him and  with each other  they keep his ordinances  and grow in grace  in  knowledge  and in numbers  they may take one step farther  since this  last sentence was written  the converted nestorians have proceeded even  to the adoption of a creed and directory for worship     did the limits of this volume allow  it would be pleasant to dwell at  length on the labors of miss mary susan rice  who joined miss fiske in  november        and has ever since toiled diligently  and without  interruption  at her post  since the return of miss fiske she has  entered into all her labors  both thoroughly and successfully  her  fifteen years of toil will never be forgotten by those who have been  privileged to receive her instructions  both in and out of the  seminary  they form an important part of the instrumentalities god has  employed to bring woman in persia to the knowledge of her saviour  a  mass of her correspondence now lies before the writer  which he has  read with much interest  but to quote from it would only be   reproducing scenes already portrayed  it is not necessary to describe  the laying of each course of brick in the walls of the spiritual temple     one sentence  however  now arrests my eye  which i must quote  because  it shows how the saviour was preparing her for the sole care of the  school  that has devolved on her ever since  owing to the protracted  illness of miss aura j  beach  who was sent out to her assistance in  february        writing to her predecessor  three years ago  she says    o  what a relief to roll the burdens  which we cannot bear  upon the  strong arm outstretched to help  and feel that  like sinking peter  we  shall be sustained amid raging billows      labor among the nestorians is becoming more assimilated to labor at  home  instead of the national peculiarities conspicuous at the outset   different from our own  and prominent because so different  things  begin to move in familiar orbits  because they set out from similar  conditions and tend to like results  in proportion as the gospel  advances in its work  the distinguishing characteristics of a people  fall into the background  to give place to those spiritual features  common to the work of grace in every land  the river is most  picturesque high up among the mountains  while its stream is yet small  and many obstacles oppose its course  after it glides out from among  the hills into the open plain  it moves with larger volume  but in a  more monotonous current  to the sea     may the work of god advance  till this unity of all nations in jesus  christ shall every where replace the diversity and hostility under  which to day creation groans  till in the placid surface of such a  river of life the saviour shall see his own image reflected  as it is  from the sea of glass above                       charitable donations in all    states of the united  states   compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a  considerable effort  much
